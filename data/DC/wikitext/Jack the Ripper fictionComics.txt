{{short description|Works of fiction featuring Jack the Ripper}}
[[Jack the Ripper]], the notorious serial killer who terrorized Whitechapel in 1888, features in works of [[fiction]] ranging from [[gothic novel]]s published at the time of the murders to modern motion pictures, televised dramas and video games.

Important influences on the depiction of the Ripper include [[Marie Belloc Lowndes]]' 1913 novel ''[[The Lodger (novel)|The Lodger]]'', which has been adapted for the stage and film, and [[Stephen Knight (author)|Stephen Knight]]'s 1976 work ''[[Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution]]'', which expanded on a conspiracy theory involving freemasons and royalty. The literature of the late [[Victorian era]], including [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s first [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories and [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'', has provided inspiration for story-makers who have fused these fictional worlds with the Ripper.

The Ripper makes appearances throughout the [[science fiction]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]] genres and is internationally recognised as an evil character. The association of the Ripper with death and sex is particularly appealing to [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[rock music|rock]] musicians, who have incorporated the Ripper murders into their work.

==Literature==
[[File:The Curse Upon Mitre Square - Title Page.jpg|thumb|right|Title page of ''The Curse Upon Mitre Square'', 1888]]
Works of fiction inspired by the [[Whitechapel murders]] arose immediately after the atrocities were committed. The short [[Gothic novel]] ''The Curse Upon Mitre Square'' by [[John Francis Brewer]], which features the murder of [[Catherine Eddowes]] in [[Mitre Square]] as a key plot element, was published in October 1888.<ref>{{cite book |title=The curse upon Mitre square.

Lovell Company |location=New York |oclc=43935642}}</ref><ref>Woods and Baddeley, pp. 61–62</ref> Among works by other authors, ''In Darkest London'' by [[Margaret Harkness]], who used the pseudonym John Law, was published in 1889. Harkness depicts the Ripper as a non-Jewish slaughterman who hides among the Jews in the [[East End of London]].<ref>Meikle, p. 40</ref>

Ripper stories appealed to an international audience.<ref name=c246/> A "reputedly unsavoury" anthology of [[Short story|short stories]] in Swedish, ''Uppskäraren'' ("The Ripper") by [[Adolf Paul]], was published in 1892, but it was suppressed by Russian authorities.<ref name=w&b67>Woods and Baddeley, p. 67</ref>

The character of [[Sherlock Holmes]] has been used often in Jack the Ripper fiction. In 1907, ''Aus den Geheimakten des Welt-Detektivs'' No. 18 from German publisher Verlagshaus für Volksliteratur und Kunst featured "Wie Jack, der Aufschlitzer, gefasst wurde" (How Jack the Ripper Was Taken), in which Holmes captures the Ripper.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sherlockiana.dk/hjemmesider/Om%20museet/hefteserier/Om%20hefteserier/hefteserier.htm |title=Sherlock Holmes in the Penny Dreadfuls|last=Nordberg|first=Nils |access-date=2015-01-19 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121062956/http://www.sherlockiana.dk/hjemmesider/Om%20museet/hefteserier/Om%20hefteserier/hefteserier.htm |archive-date=2016-01-21 }}</ref> In the 1930s the story was translated into Spanish in for ''Sherlock Holmes Memorias intimas del rey de los detectives'' No. 3, "El Destripador" (The Ripper), recently reprinted in a new book and translated into English for the first time.<ref>Sherlock Holmes Versus Jack the Ripper by Joseph A. Lovece, Createspace, 2014</ref> Cullen called the story "amusing Sherlock Holmes pastiche".<ref name=c246/> Holmes was also used later in [[Michael Dibdin]]'s ''[[The Last Sherlock Holmes Story]]'' (1978), [[Ellery Queen]]'s ''[[A Study in Terror]]'' (1966), [[John Sladek]]'s ''Black Aura'' (1974), and [[Barrie Roberts]]' ''Sherlock Holmes and the Royal Flush'' (1998) amongst others.<ref>Whitehead and Rivett, p. 135</ref>

The first influential short story, "The Lodger" by [[Marie Belloc Lowndes]], was published in ''[[McClure's Magazine]]'' in 1911 and novelised in 1913.<ref name=w&b67/> It features a London couple, Mr and Mrs Bunting, who suspect that their lodger, Mr Sleuth, is a mysterious killer known as "The Avenger", clearly based on the Ripper.<ref name=m44>Meikle, pp. 44–48</ref> Whether Sleuth really is "The Avenger" is left open: the focus of the story is on the Buntings' psychological terror, which may be entirely unfounded, rather than the actions of "The Avenger".<ref name=m44/> In 1927, "The Lodger" was the subject of an [[Alfred Hitchcock]]-directed film: ''[[The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog]]'', and four other adaptations were filmed in later years.

In 1926, [[Leonard Matters]] proposed in a magazine article that the Ripper was an eminent doctor, whose son had died from [[syphilis]] caught from a prostitute. According to Matters, the doctor, given the pseudonym "Dr Stanley", committed the murders in revenge and then fled to Argentina. He expanded his ideas into a book, ''The Mystery of Jack the Ripper'', in 1929. The book was marketed as a serious study, but it contains obvious factual errors and the documents it supposedly uses as references have never been found.<ref>Woods and Baddeley, pp. 114–115</ref> It inspired other works such as the theatre play ''Murder Most Foul'' and the film ''[[Jack the Ripper (1959 film)|Jack the Ripper]]''.<ref>Woods and Baddeley, pp. 160, 198</ref> Jonathan Goodman's 1984 book ''Who He?'' is also written as if it is a factual study, but the suspect described, "Peter J Harpick", is an invention whose name is an anagram of Jack the Ripper.<ref>Whitehead and Rivett, pp. 12–13</ref> 

[[Robert Bloch]]'s short story "Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper" (published in ''[[Weird Tales]]'' in 1943<ref name=w&b67/>) cast the Ripper as an eternal who must make [[human sacrifice]]s to extend his [[immortality]].<ref>Meikle, p. 110</ref> It was adapted for both radio (in ''Stay Tuned for Terror'') and television (as an episode of ''[[Thriller (U.S. TV series)|Thriller]]'' in 1961 written by [[Barré Lyndon]]).<ref name=w&b68>Woods and Baddeley, p. 68</ref> The science-fiction anthology ''[[Dangerous Visions]]'' (1967) featured an unrelated Ripper story by Bloch, "[[A Toy for Juliette]]", and a sequel by [[Harlan Ellison]], "[[The Prowler in the City at the Edge of the World]]", written with Bloch's permission. Bloch's work also includes ''The Will to Kill'' (1954) and ''[[Night of the Ripper]]'' (1984).<ref>Whitehead and Rivett, pp. 133, 135–136</ref>

==Theatre, opera and music theatre==
The Ripper features at the end of [[Frank Wedekind]]'s [[morality play]] ''[[Pandora's Box (play)|Die Büchse der Pandora]]'' (1904), in which the Ripper murders Lulu, the central character. Lulu is the personification of sinful [[Lust]] who meets her comeuppance when she unwittingly flirts with the Ripper.<ref>Meikle, p. 34</ref> In the original stage production, Wedekind played the part of the Ripper.<ref name=c246>Cullen, p. 246</ref> The play was later adapted into the film ''[[Pandora's Box (1929 film)|Pandora's Box]]'' (1928, directed by [[Georg Wilhelm Pabst]]), and the opera ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'' (by [[Alban Berg]]), both of which also end with the murder of Lulu by the Ripper.<ref>Woods and Baddeley, p. 165</ref> It was also made into three films in 1923, 1962 and 1980 respectively,<ref>Cullen, p. 246; Meikle, pp. 212–226</ref> and a play ''Lulu'' by Peter Barnes premièred in 1970.<ref>Rumbelow, p. 286</ref>

[[André de Lorde]]'s ''Jack l'Eventreur'' was part of the [[Grand Guignol]]'s output in Paris.<ref name=c249/> Marie Belloc Lowndes' novel and short story ''The Lodger'' was adapted for the stage as ''The Lodger: Who Is He?'' by [[Horace Annesley Vachell]]. In 1917, [[Lionel Atwill]]'s first role in [[Broadway theatre]] was as the title character.<ref>Meikle, p. 49</ref> [[Phyllis Tate]] also based her opera ''[[The Lodger (opera)|The Lodger]]'', first performed in 1960, on Lowndes' story.<ref>Cullen, p. 248</ref>

''Murder Most Foul'' by Claude Pirkis was first performed in 1948. The character of the murderer, Dr. Stanley, was taken from ''The Mystery of Jack the Ripper'' by Leonard Matters, first published in 1929.<ref>Woods and Baddeley, pp. 159–160</ref> Doug Lucie's ''Force and Hypocrisy'' is based on the royal conspiracy theory of Stephen Knight.<ref>Rumbelow, p. 292</ref>

Two British musicals, ''Ripper'' by Terence Greer and ''The Jack the Ripper Show and How They Wrote It'' by Frank Hatherley, were staged in 1973.<ref>Wilson and Odell, pp. 310–311</ref> [[Jack the Ripper (musical)|''Jack the Ripper: The Musical'']] (1974), with lyrics and music by [[Ron Pember]], who co-authored the book with Dennis de Marne,<ref>Ron Pember & Denis de Marne, ''Jack The Ripper: A Musical Play'' (Samuel French Ltd., 1976)</ref> influenced [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]''.<ref name=w&b76>Woods and Baddeley, pp. 75–76</ref> In 1996, a rock opera entitled ''Yours Truly: Jack the Ripper'' with lyrics by Frogg Moody and Dave Taylor was performed and, in a break from recent practice, portrayed the Ripper as an ordinary everyday man.<ref name=w&b77>Woods and Baddeley, pp. 77</ref>

==Film==
[[Marie Belloc Lowndes]]' book ''The Lodger'' has been made into five films: [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog]]'' (1927), ''[[The Lodger (1932 film)|The Lodger]]'' (1932), ''[[The Lodger (1944 film)|The Lodger]]'' (1944), ''[[Man in the Attic]]'' (1953) and ''[[The Lodger (2009 film)|The Lodger]]'' (2009). Hitchcock decided to cast romantic lead [[Ivor Novello]] as the title character in his version of ''The Lodger'', with the consequence that the film company, [[Gainsborough Pictures]], insisted on a re-write to make Novello's character more sympathetic.<ref>Meikle, p. 50</ref> In a change from the original story, whether the lodger is the killer is no longer left ambivalent at the end. Instead, the lodger's strange behaviour arises because he is a vigilante, trying to catch the real killer.<ref>Meikle, pp. 50–51</ref> Novello remade the film in 1932 with a more dramatic ending, in which he throttles the killer, who is his demented brother, the "Bosnian Murderer".<ref>Meikle, pp. 53–54</ref> Novello played both roles, and [[Maurice Elvey]] directed. It was released in an abridged version as ''The Phantom Fiend'' in 1935.<ref name="Meikle, p. 55">Meikle, p. 55</ref> The 1944 version dispensed with the ambivalence of the novel and instead casts the lodger, "Slade" played by [[Laird Cregar]], as the villain "Jack the Ripper".<ref name="Meikle, p. 55"/> Unlike the earlier versions, the film is set in 1888, rather than in the year of the film's making.<ref>Meikle, p. 56</ref> The 1953 version, ''Man in the Attic'' with [[Jack Palance]] as "Slade", covers much the same ground.<ref>Meikle, pp. 61–63</ref> The 2009 film casts [[Simon Baker]] as "Malcolm Slaight".

[[File:Eric Porter (DR Pritchard) dans La fille de Jack l'éventreur -1971.jpg|thumb|right|Sketch of [[Eric Porter]] as the character "Dr John Pritchard" in ''[[Hands of the Ripper]]''. In the film, the kindly Dr Pritchard adopts the Ripper's murderous daughter.<ref>Meikle, p. 121</ref>]]
''Room to Let'' (1950) is similar to ''The Lodger'' story but was based on a 1948 radio play by [[Margery Allingham]]. It was one of the first horror pictures made by [[Hammer Film Productions]].<ref>Woods and Baddeley, p. 196</ref> [[Valentine Dyall]] plays the lodger, "Dr. Fell", who has escaped from a lunatic asylum where he has been incarcerated for 16 years since committing the [[Whitechapel murders]].<ref>Meikle, pp. 59–61</ref> Hammer released two Ripper-inspired films in 1971. In ''[[Hands of the Ripper]]'', the Ripper's daughter (played by [[Angharad Rees]]) grows up to become a murderess after she sees her father kill her mother.<ref>Meikle, p. 121; Woods and Baddeley, p. 200</ref> In ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde]]'', Dr. Henry Jekyll transforms into the evil predatory woman Sister Hyde and is also responsible for the Ripper murders.<ref>Meikle, p. 125; Woods and Baddeley, p. 199</ref> In ''Terror in the Wax Museum'' (1973), a murderer disguises himself as a waxwork of the Ripper.<ref>Meikle, p. 129</ref>

''[[The Veil]]'' episode "Jack the Ripper" (1958) is a made-for-television film introduced by [[Boris Karloff]], in which a clairvoyant identifies the Ripper as a respectable surgeon whose death has been faked to cover his incarceration in a lunatic asylum.<ref>Meikle, p. 67</ref> The story's basis was an 1895 newspaper report that [[Robert James Lees]] had used psychic powers to track the Ripper to the home of a London physician.<ref>Meikle, p. 68</ref>

''[[Jack the Ripper (1959 film)|Jack the Ripper]]'' (1959), produced by [[Monty Berman]] and [[Robert S. Baker]] and written by [[Jimmy Sangster]], is loosely based on [[Leonard Matters]]' theory that the Ripper was an avenging doctor.<ref>Meikle, pp. 75–79; Woods and Baddeley, p. 198</ref> It borrowed icons from previously successful horror films, such as ''[[Dracula (1958 film)|Dracula]]'' (1958) and ''[[The Curse of Frankenstein]]'' (1957), by giving the Ripper a costume of a top hat and cape.<ref>Woods and Baddeley, p. 197</ref> The plot is a standard "whodunit" with the usual false leads and a denouement in which the least likely character, in this case "Sir David Rogers" played by [[Ewen Solon]], is revealed as the culprit.<ref>Meikle, pp. 76–77</ref> As in Matters' book, ''The Mystery of Jack the Ripper'', Solon's character murders prostitutes to avenge the death of his son. However, Matters used the ploy of the son dying from venereal disease, while the film has him committing suicide on learning his lover is a prostitute.<ref>Meikle, p. 79</ref> In a reversal of this formula, the German film ''[[The Monster of London City|Das Ungeheuer von London City]]'' (1964), released as ''The Monster of London City'' in 1967, casts the son as the villain with the father as the victim of syphilis.<ref>Meikle, pp. 86–87</ref>

''[[Pandora's Box (1929 film)|Pandora's Box]]'' (''Die Büchse der Pandora'') is a 1929 German silent film directed by [[Georg Wilhelm Pabst]] based on [[Frank Wedekind]]'s play about a woman, Lulu, played by [[Louise Brooks]]. Her uninhibited lifestyle leads her to walk the streets of London until she meets her end in an encounter with Jack the Ripper, played by [[Gustav Diessl]].<ref>Meikle, p. 33–34; Woods and Baddeley, p. 165</ref> An earlier German film, [[Paul Leni]]'s ''[[Waxworks (film)|Waxworks]]'' (''Das Wachsfigurenkabinett'') from 1924, used a Ripper-style event in one of three dreamed vignettes.<ref>Woods and Baddeley, pp. 166–167</ref> The "Jack" character was played by [[Werner Krauss]], who had achieved enormous success with his portrayal of the evil title character in the influential early horror film ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]''.<ref>Meikle, p. 30</ref>

''[[A Study in Terror]]'' (1965) and ''[[Murder by Decree]]'' (1979) both pit [[Sherlock Holmes]] against the Ripper. ''A Study in Terror'', and its companion novel written by [[Ellery Queen]],<ref>Meikle, p. 99; Woods and Baddeley, p. 150</ref> feature the often insane family of the Duke of Shires, with a motive provided by one of his son's becoming enamoured of a prostitute.<ref>Meikle, pp. 92–99</ref> ''Murder by Decree'', starring [[Christopher Plummer]] as Sherlock Holmes and [[James Mason]] as Watson, follows the [[Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution|masonic/royal conspiracy]] plotline popularised by [[Stephen Knight (author)|Stephen Knight]], in which a royal physician is the murderer. Coincidentally, in both movies, character actor [[Frank Finlay]] plays [[Inspector Lestrade]].<ref>Meikle, p. 150</ref> Part of the conspiracy plotline was followed in the television miniseries ''[[Jack the Ripper (1988 TV series)|Jack the Ripper]]'' (1988) starring [[Michael Caine]] as Inspector [[Frederick Abberline]]. In the 1997 film ''The Ripper'', [[Samuel West]] starred as [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Eddy]], who was revealed as the Ripper, and the 1999 film ''[[Love Lies Bleeding (1999 film)|Love Lies Bleeding]]'' featured [[Paul Rhys]], [[Emily Raymond]] and [[Faye Dunaway]]. In 2001, the [[Hughes Brothers]] made the comic book ''[[From Hell]]'' into a [[From Hell (film)|film of the same name]] starring [[Johnny Depp]] as Abberline. The film again sticks to the Knight storyline, though Depp's character differs significantly from Caine's heroic Abberline and exhibits aspects of both Sherlock Holmes (deductive powers, drug addiction) and [[Robert Lees (psychic)|Robert Lees]] (psychic ability, foresight).

Peter Barnes' stage play ''[[The Ruling Class (play)|The Ruling Class]]'' (1968) and [[The Ruling Class (film)|its film adaptation]] (1972) are satires on the British aristocracy that link the Ripper to the British upper class.<ref name=m131/> Jack Gurney, the mentally ill 14th Earl of Gurney (played in the film version by [[Peter O'Toole]]), spends part of the plot believing himself to be Jack the Ripper, and performs a pair of Ripper murders.<ref name=m131/> The black comedy ''Deadly Advice'' (1994) features [[Jane Horrocks]] as a serial killer who imagines that she is given advice by the incarnations of famous murderers. [[John Mills]] plays Jack the Ripper as an outwardly mild-mannered hairdresser. "Just be the sort of person nobody suspects," he tells her.<ref>Meikle, p. 171</ref> In an earlier black comedy, ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'', the antagonist is named General Jack D. Ripper, but the comparison goes no deeper.<ref>Meikle, p. 88; Woods and Baddeley, p. 69</ref> ''[[Amazon Women on the Moon]]'' is a 1987 comedy film that parodies theories of the Ripper's identity by speculating that Jack the Ripper was the [[Loch Ness Monster]] in disguise.<ref>Meikle, pp. 205–206; Woods and Baddeley, p. 73</ref> [[Marcel Carné]]'s ''[[Drôle de Drame]]'' (1937) is another parody of the Ripper, featuring [[Jean-Louis Barrault]] as an [[East End of London|East End]] vegetarian who slaughters butchers in revenge for their slaughter of animals.<ref name=c249>Cullen, p. 249</ref> In ''[[Shanghai Knights]]'' (2003), Jack the Ripper attempts to murder the sister of [[Jackie Chan]]'s character, only for her to angrily kick him off a bridge.

''Night After Night After Night'' (1969) was a low-budget production that cast a high court judge (played by [[Jack May]]) as a demented [[Copycat crime|copycat]] Ripper who attacks prostitutes in London's [[Soho]].<ref>Meikle, pp. 100–101</ref> Throughout the 1970s and 1980s tenuous links with the Ripper case were introduced into films for commercial reasons; sexploitation horror movies ''Blade of the Ripper'' (1970), ''The Ripper of Notre Dame'' (1981) and ''[[The New York Ripper]]'' (1982) have little relation to the Ripper beyond the title.<ref>Meikle, p. 155–157, 183; Woods and Baddeley, pp. 203–204</ref> ''The Ripper of Notre Dame'' was directed and co-written by [[Jesús Franco]], whose ''[[Jack the Ripper (1976 film)|Jack the Ripper]]'' (1976) stars [[Klaus Kinski]] as a murderous doctor whose mother was a prostitute.<ref>Meikle, p. 104</ref> ''What the Swedish Butler Saw'' (1975), in which Jack the Ripper hides in a photographic studio, is little more than softcore pornography.<ref>Meikle, p. 140</ref> Thrillers ''Jack the Mangler of London'' (1973), ''[[Fear City]]'' (1984), ''Night Ripper'' (1986) and ''[[Jack's Back]]'' (1988) received poor reviews,<ref>Meikle, pp. 102–103, 156, 159–160; Woods and Baddeley, pp. 204–205</ref> as did the Japanese [[pink film]] ''[[Assault! Jack the Ripper]]''.<ref>Woods and Baddeley, p. 206</ref> ''[[Edge of Sanity (film)|Edge of Sanity]]'' (1989) is lent "post-''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' gravitas" by the casting of [[Anthony Perkins]] as "Dr Jekyll" and his alter-ego "Jack Hyde", but was still condemned by critics "as a tasteless exercise".<ref>Woods and Baddeley, p. 207</ref> The [[Dolph Lundgren]] [[Star vehicle|vehicle]] ''[[Jill the Ripper]]'' (2000) reverses the traditional genders of victims and villains, with a female Ripper and male victims.<ref>Meikle, p. 183</ref>

In ''[[Time After Time (1979 film)|Time After Time]]'' (1979), based on [[Time After Time (Alexander novel)|the novel of the same title]], Jack escapes in a [[Time travel|time machine]] to modern-day San Francisco and is pursued by [[H. G. Wells]]. The pursuer was originally slated to be [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] in a link to the author of ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'', but he was written out in favour of Wells.<ref>Meikle, pp. 136–137; Woods and Baddeley, p. 205</ref> In ''[[Bridge Across Time]]'' (1985), starring [[David Hasselhoff]], Jack's spirit is transported to Arizona in a cursed stone from [[London Bridge (Lake Havasu City)|London Bridge]].<ref name=w&b205>Meikle, pp. 157–158; Woods and Baddeley, p. 205</ref> In ''The Ripper'' (1985), his spirit is instead concealed in a cursed ring.<ref name=w&b205/> ''Ripper Man'' (1994) depicts a killer who believes himself to be the reincarnation of [[George Chapman (murderer)|George Chapman]], who was suspected of being Jack the Ripper after his arrest and execution for murder in 1903.<ref>Meikle, pp. 173–174</ref>

Released in the same year as ''From Hell'', and consequently overshadowed by it,<ref>Woods and Baddeley, p. 213</ref> were ''[[Ripper (film)|Ripper]]'' and ''[[Bad Karma (2002 film)|Bad Karma]]'' (re-titled as ''Hell's Gate''). ''Ripper'' centres on psychology student Molly Keller (played by [[A. J. Cook (actress)|A. J. Cook]]) who studies serial killers. Her classmates start dying at the hands of a Jack the Ripper copycat, who targets victims with the same initials as the originals.<ref>Meikle, p. 200</ref> ''Bad Karma'' is another play on the reincarnation theme with the addition of [[Patsy Kensit]] as the Ripper's female accomplice.<ref>Meikle, pp. 185–186</ref>

==Television==
By the 1960s, the Ripper was established in American television as a "universal force of evil", who could be adapted to suit any villainous niche.<ref name=m131>Meikle, pp. 131–133</ref> In an episode of ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' from 1963 entitled "[[The New Exhibit]]", [[Martin Balsam]] plays the curator of a wax museum who becomes so obsessed by five wax figures of murderers, including Jack the Ripper, that he commits murder to protect them.<ref>Meikle, p. 115</ref> In the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode "[[Wolf in the Fold]]" (1967), writer [[Robert Bloch]] reused parts of his short-story "Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper", which had already appeared as a 1961 television episode of ''[[Thriller (U.S. TV series)|Thriller]]''.<ref name=w&b68/><ref name=m131/> In the episode, the Ripper turned out to be a long-lived non-corporeal being that had committed mass murders on many worlds over centuries to generate fear, the emotion on which it fed. The entity is beamed out into space. In the ''[[Cimarron Strip]]'' episode "Knife in the Wilderness" (1968), written by [[Harlan Ellison]],<ref name=w&b68/> Jack continues his work across America ending in Cimarron City where he meets his end at the hands of Indians.<ref>Meikle, pp. 117–118</ref> In the ''[[Get Smart]]'' episode "House of Max" (1970), Jack the Ripper is an animated wax dummy.<ref>Woods and Baddeley, p. 171</ref>

In ''[[The Sixth Sense (American TV series)|The Sixth Sense]]'' episode "With Affection, Jack the Ripper" (1972) a man is driven mad during a [[paranormal]] experiment when he inhabits the body of Jack the Ripper.<ref>Meikle, p. 133</ref> A ''[[Fantasy Island]]'' episode, also titled "With Affection, Jack the Ripper" (1980), was written by the same writer as the episode of ''The Sixth Sense'', Don Ingalls. [[Lynda Day George]] plays criminologist Lorraine Peters who uses a time portal to confirm her suspicion that Jack the Ripper was a doctor, Albert Fell, played by [[Victor Buono]]. Fell follows her back through the portal, grabs Peters and takes her back to 1888, where the enigmatic Mr. Roarke intervenes fortuitously, and Fell dies moments later while fleeing.<ref name=m139>Meikle, p. 139</ref> The name Fell is clearly lifted from Margery Allingham's 1948 radio play ''Room to Let''.<ref name=m139/> A time portal is also used in "A Rip in Time" (1997), the first episode of the short-lived television series ''[[Timecop (TV series)|Timecop]]'', in which a time travelling cop travels back to 1888 to catch a criminal who has killed, and displaced, Jack the Ripper.<ref>Meikle, p. 180</ref> ''[[Ripper Street]]'' is a 2012 British television dramatic series set just subsequent to the murders, with the first episode seeing series protagonist [[Edmund Reid]] resolving to move on from obsession over the victims after a new case; at the end of the first season, protagonist Homer Jackson is temporarily framed as the Ripper, but is able to clear his name.

The ''[[Babylon 5]]'' episode "[[Comes the Inquisitor]]" (1995) features a character named Sebastian who is Jack the Ripper, abducted by the alien [[Vorlon]]s in the year 1888 and made into their inquisitor so that he can test (through torture) beings who are called to lead an important cause.<ref>Meikle, pp. 175–176</ref> In the TV series ''[[Grimm (TV series)|Grimm]]'', the final three episodes of the [[Grimm (season 4)|fourth season]] reveal that Jack the Ripper was a spirit that initially manifested over a century before the Whitechapel murders; the Jack spirit possesses series protagonist Sean Renard after a near-death experience, but the others are able to 'exorcise' Jack by shooting Renard with rubber bullets to trick Jack into thinking that Renard was being murdered. The idea of the Ripper as a supernatural entity is used again in the [[Sleepy Hollow (season 3)|third season]] of the television series ''[[Sleepy Hollow (TV series)|Sleepy Hollow]]'', with the 'killer' in this case being a knife that drives its wielder to act on their darker impulses as it absorbs the blood of its victims; it is defeated when it is tricked into stabbing someone with [[malaria]], the infection tainting the blood and thus weakening the blade.

''[[Jack the Ripper (1973 TV series)|Jack the Ripper]]'' (1973) by [[Elwyn Jones (writer)|Elwyn Jones]] and [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]] linked with the police drama ''[[Z-Cars]]''.

The killer has superhuman strength and is invulnerable to weapons, but Kolchak dematerialises the apparently immortal being by electrocuting him.<ref>Meikle, pp. 135–136</ref> An episode of ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' titled "[[Ripper (The Outer Limits)|Ripper]]" (1997) was set in 1888 and starred [[Cary Elwes]] as Dr. Jack York, who kills women whom he believes are possessed by an alien entity.<ref>Meikle, pp. 181–182</ref> In an episode of ''[[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World]]'', "The Knife" (2001), the explorers meet the two men blamed for the murders in Stephen Knight's royal conspiracy theory: [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]] and [[Robert Anderson (police official)|Robert Anderson]].<ref>Meikle, p. 206</ref> [[Spike Milligan]] parodied the Ripper-genre in the "sublimely daft" ''[[The Phantom Raspberry Blower|The Phantom Raspberry Blower of Old London Town]]''.<ref>Whitehead and Rivett, p. 149</ref> In an episode of Friday the 13th: the Series" entitled "Dr. Jack" Mickey, Ryan and Jack retrieve an antique surgeon's knife that was reputedly used by Jack the Ripper.

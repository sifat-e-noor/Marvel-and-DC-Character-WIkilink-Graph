'''[[Quality Comics]]''' was a comic book company from the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]]. It operated from 1937 to 1956 and sold many anthology comic books that starred superheroes, many of which were adopted by [[DC Comics]] when they purchased Quality Comics, and others were not, entering the [[public domain]].

== #711 ==
'''#711''' was created by [[George Brenner]] and published by [[Quality Comics]]. #711 first appeared in ''[[Police Comics]]'' #1 (August 1941) and lasted until #16 (January 1943), when he was killed.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Morris |first1=Jon |title=The League of Regrettable Superheroes: Half Baked Heroes from Comic Book History |date=2015 |publisher=Quirk Books |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |isbn=978-1-59474-763-2 |page=12}}</ref>

Daniel Dyce was a [[District Attorney]] who was almost an exact twin of his friend, Jacob Horn. Jacob was in prison, but wanted to see his wife give birth, so Daniel agreed to become a prisoner while Jacob was with his wife. However, Jacob is killed in a car crash on the way to the hospital, so Daniel was stuck in jail. Daniel was able to tunnel himself free, but instead of escaping, he decided to return to his cell. Each night he uses his tunnel to go outside and  fight crime, then returns before the morning.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mitchell |first1=Kurt |last2=Thomas |first2=Roy |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1940–1944 |date=2019 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1-60549-089-2 |page=121}}</ref> Dyce adopts the name #711, a reference to his prisoner number. One of his enemies is the costumed villain Brickbat.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Morris |first1=Jon |title=The Legion of Regrettable Supervillains: Oddball Criminals from Comic Book History |date=2017 |publisher=Quirk Books |isbn=978-1-59474-932-2 |pages=30–31}}</ref>

After two years of adventures Daniel Dyce was killed by the mobster Oscar Jones. The hero [[Destiny (Quality)|Destiny]] sees this take place, and starts his crime fighting career when #711 died, replacing his feature in ''Police Comics''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nevins |first1=Jess |title=Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes |date=2013 |publisher=High Rock Press |isbn=978-1-61318-023-5 |page=305}}</ref>

Like many early [[comic book]] heroes, #711 did not wear a traditional costume but rather was modeled after the traditional [[pulp magazine]] heroes.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Koolman |first1=Mike |last2=Amash |first2=Jim |title=The Quality Companion |date=2011 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1-60549-037-3 |pages=183–184}}</ref> He wore a green cape, a brown business suit, and a wide-brimmed fedora which cast his eyes in shadow.  #711's trademark was a calling card made of a mirror with bars painted over it; when an unlucky criminal would look at the card, they would see themselves behind bars.

Brenner replaced #711 with a new hero — a mysterious figure who discovers that he has the powers of clairvoyance and teleportation, and uses them to bring 711's murderer to justice. The new hero christens himself "Destiny", and continues the series.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mitchell |first1=Kurt |last2=Thomas |first2=Roy |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1940–1944 |date=2019 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1-60549-089-2 |pages=223–224}}</ref>

Following the Golden Age, many of the Quality Comics characters were purchased by [[DC Comics]], while others lapsed into the [[public domain]]. DC has used #711 only once in their publications, a ''[[Millennium Edition (DC Comics)|Millennium Edition]]'' reprint of his first appearance.

In 1939, Black X tangled with the seductive spy Madame Doom, and over the course of several stories, he fell in love with her, wondering if he could betray his country to be with the agent of an enemy nation. Discovering that she's building an army of exploding human bombs in a 1940 story, Black X renounced his affection, and Madame Doom apparently died in an explosion—although she continued to return periodically through 1943.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Madrid |first1=Mike |title=Vixens, Vamps & Vipers: Lost Villainesses of Golden Age Comics |date=2014 |publisher=Exterminating Angel Press |isbn=978-1-935259-27-5 |page=23}}</ref>

Neither Dunn nor Jones have any superpowers, but Dunn is a good fighter and skilled [[engineer]]. The Blue Tracer allows Dunn and Jones to travel on land, under the sea, and in the air. It has many weapons, and can deflect small arms fire easily.

Creator [[Fred Guardineer]] drew a detailed half-page diagram of the vehicle in the fourth issue.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mitchell |first1=Kurt |last2=Thomas |first2=Roy |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1940–1944 |date=2019 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1-60549-089-2 |page=120}}</ref>

Tom Dalton became Magno. He was powered by the very electricity that saved his life, and he used it to fight crime with his magnetic and electrical abilities. He sometimes ran out of power and had to recharge himself by touching exposed wires.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Thomas |first1=Roy |title=The All-Star Companion: Vol 2 |date=2006 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1-893905-37-5 |page=89}}</ref> He was featured in ''[[Smash Comics]]'' until issue #21 (April 1941).

According to ''Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes'', "Magno and Davey take on a variety of foes: human-sacrificing Aztec cultists, the four-armed, fanged [[Yellow Peril]] Professor Octopus, and Magno and Davey's recurring foe, the Clown, who works out of a traveling cricus and uses hyper-intelligent trained rats to carry out his crimes".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nevins |first1=Jess |title=Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes |date=2013 |publisher=High Rock Press |isbn=978-1-61318-023-5 |page=73}}</ref>

Once, he even threw a [[harpoon]] into the back of a fleeing opponent (he'd run out of bullets), rather than let him get away.

He was a skilled brawler and marksman, an above-average detective and an expert in criminal law.

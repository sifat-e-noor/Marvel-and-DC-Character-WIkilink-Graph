====Infinite Frontier====
Following the events of ''[[Dark Nights: Death Metal]]'', DuBois was reintroduced back into the DC Universe. After his brother's death, his mental state deteriorated, leading him to become the mercenary Bloodsport. After failing to kill Superman, he was sent to Belle Reve until he was forced into the Suicide Squad with the task of exploring the Multiverse for [[Amanda Waller]]'s own personal ambitions.

==Characterization==
===Personality===
DuBois pretends that he is a bitter Vietnam veteran who feels greatly betrayed and rejected by his country, thus he enjoys powerful and righteous anger toward his fellow Americans for wasting the freedoms invading Vietnam supposedly helped preserve.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/suicide-squad-bloodsport-shot-superman-bullet/|title=Suicide Squad: Bloodsport Really DID Shoot Superman in Comics|last=Godino|first=Edward|website=[[Screen Rant]]|date=August 22, 2020|access-date=January 1, 2021}}</ref> However, he has no first-hand experience about this war, ergo, his speeches and character are largely drawn from movies about the war and folk representations of Vietnam War veterans. Though at first he seemed aware that his vet persona was fictional, he grew increasingly delusional and dissociated.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bamsmackpow.com/2020/08/23/the-suicide-squad-who-is-idris-elba-bloodsport/|title=The Suicide Squad: Who is Idris Elba's Bloodsport?|last=Johnson|first=Michael|website=Bam Smack Pow|date=August 23, 2020|access-date=January 1, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://moviecomicswhoswho.wordpress.com/2017/09/15/robert-dubois-bloodsport/|title=Robert DuBois (Bloodsport)|website=Who's Who|date=September 15, 2017|access-date=January 1, 2021}}</ref> Described as a very violent and powerful man, DuBois was plunged into a permanent fantasy about being a soldier, and was even feared by the other dangerous prisoners at [[Stryker's Island|Stryker's Island Prison]] in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/suicide-squad-bloodsport-idris-elba-comics-explained/|title=Who is Bloodsport?

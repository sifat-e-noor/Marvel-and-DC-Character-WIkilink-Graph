==Fictional character biography==

===Pre-''Crisis''===

====Golden Age====
[[File:Baroness_by_Peter.jpg|thumb|left|200px| The [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] Baroness alongside a captive [[Steve Trevor]] in ''[[Sensation Comics]]'' (vol. 1) #4 (April 1942); art by [[H.G. Peter|Harry G. Peter]].]]
A member of the noble class in pre-National Socialist Germany with the rank of Baroness, Paula von Gunther first appeared as a foe of [[Wonder Woman]]. She battled the Amazon numerous times as an agent of the Gestapo. Her many crimes include murdering many individuals, keeping a small group of women as personal slaves and torturing them routinely, was for a time the leader of all Gestapo operations in the United States, forcing American female citizens into becoming Nazi spies, attempting to kidnap a Colonel using an invisible ray on a ship while impersonating a high-society lady and stealing Wonder Woman's lasso while trying to steal secrets from security officers. She succeeded in capturing Wonder Woman with it and bound her hand and foot to a wooden pole using it. However Wonder Woman got off the pole and broke open a cage freeing a young boy named Freddy. He untied her hands, but Gunther returned and stopped Wonder Woman by pointing a gun at her back. However Freddy lassoed Gunther, and Wonder Woman stopped her plan. She once tried to monopolize America's milk supply and charge high prices for it so that its people would have weak bones and fall before the stronger-boned Nazis after buying all the milk of a company for five years with seven million dollars. In her first appearance she discovered Wonder Woman’s weakness, which is if her bracelets were chained by a man she becomes as weak as an ordinary woman. While monopolizing milk, her men lassoed Wonder Woman and bound her hand and foot with chains. She was bound to railway tracks, but was able to free herself.{{issue|date=January 2012}}

Von Gunther was finally captured and revealed that she had worked for the Nazis because they held her daughter Gerta captive. Von Gunther reformed and pledged her loyalty to Wonder Woman after Gerta was rescued. Von Gunther even put her own life in peril to save Wonder Woman from a burning munitions plant, suffering third-degree burns and a horribly scarred face.{{issue|date=January 2012}}

Von Gunther went to trial, but Wonder Woman acted as her defense and got her off. Murder charges had to be thrown out on double jeopardy, because Paula had previously been tried, convicted...and executed for that crime in the electric chair, but her henchmen had revived her with an electrical machine she had invented after the Doctor gave her body to them (''Sensation Comics'' #7). Von Gunther later escaped by tying up a guard and stealing her uniform, but was later recaptured by Wonder Woman. While in custody, Von Gunther risked her own life to stop a bomb from going off inside a munitions factory, and was burned as a result. Wonder Woman dramatically revealed Paula's scarred face to the jury, which was moved by Paula's heroic self-sacrifice and acquitted her of the remaining espionage and sabotage charges (''Wonder Woman'' #3).

Paula returned to [[Paradise Island (comics)|Paradise Island]] with her former slave girls and her daughter to live and undergo Amazon training. Queen [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Hippolyte]] moulded fine features on Paula's face, which the goddess Aphrodite blessed and magically converted into Paula's new face.{{issue|date=January 2012}} Paula became the Amazons' chief scientist, spending part of her time on Paradise Island and part aiding Wonder Woman from a hidden underground laboratory beneath Holliday College. Her daughter Gerta also was a scientific savant, although her experiments sometimes led to accidents that needed Wonder Woman's help to fix. Gerta's enlarging ray, for example, was instrumental in helping Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor return to human size after escaping Atomia's atomic world, but also accidentally unleashed the menace of the Bughumans. At one point, her devices revived Wonder Woman, and another time, the [[Justice Society of America]].{{issue|date=January 2012}}

====Silver Age====
Her Earth-1 counterpart differed only slightly, as '''Baroness Paula von Gunta'''. The Earth-1 von Gunta appeared in ''Wonder Woman'' #163 and 168, before presumably following a similar path as the Earth-2 Paula and moving to Paradise Island to become an adopted Amazon and chief scientist.{{issue|date=January 2012}}

The Earth-1 Paula was asked to replace Hippolyta as Amazon queen during a coup d'état, which was abruptly ended when the goddess Kore appeared to enlist the Amazons in a battle against the Anti-Monitor during the Crisis on Infinite Earths.{{issue|date=January 2012}}

===Post-''Crisis''===
Following the events of the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', it was revealed that the Baroness fought [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Hippolyta]] during the time-traveling queen's World War II adventures as Wonder Woman.{{issue|date=January 2012}}

This Von Gunther was a mistress of the occult and became the human host for the evil wandering spirit, [[Dark Angel (DC Comics)|Dark Angel]]. Dark Angel became a dedicated foe of Hippolyta and was inadvertently responsible for the origin of [[Wonder Girl]] ([[Donna Troy]]).{{issue|date=January 2012}}

Donna Troy was able to defeat Dark Angel, and at some point Dark Angel separated herself from von Gunther. The Baroness was last seen living among the Amazons.{{issue|date=January 2012}}

Eventually, it was revealed that Dark Angel was not a mystical spirit but an extant [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiversal]] doppelganger of Donna Troy.{{issue|date=January 2012}}

===DC Rebirth===
[[File:Paula_Von_Gunther_the_Warmaster.jpg|thumb|upright|Baroness Paula von Gunther as Warmaster in ''[[Wonder Woman (comic book)|Wonder Woman]]'' (vol. 5) Annual #3 (2019), art by V. Ken Mario, [[Sandu Florea]] and Hi-Fi Design]]
After the events of ''[[DC Rebirth]]'', Paula von Gunther's origin is altered. As a young girl, Helen was rescued by Wonder Woman from the violent nationalists group known as the Sons of Liberty. She was adopted by Harold and Petra Paul, though Wonder Woman continued to be present in Helen's life. As an adult, Helen joined [[A.R.G.U.S.]] However, she soon learned from the supervillain [[Manhunter (Mark Shaw)|Leviathan]] that her birth parents were faction leaders of the Sons of Liberty and that her oldest ancestor is Gudra, a valkyrie with a grudge against the Amazons of Themyscira after they struck down her sisters on a supposed mission of peace. Helen, realizing Wonder Woman had lied to her, returned to her true name of Paula von Gunther and adopted the codename '''Warmaster'''.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 5) Annual #3 (2019)</ref>

As Warmaster, Paula began to assemble a group of female supervillains who have faced Wonder Woman in the past. She started with [[Devastation (comics)|Devastation]], who had been fighting with the hero [[Firebrand (DC Comics)|Firebrand]].<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #751 (2020)</ref> The pair made their headquarters in Norway, and Warmaster revealed to Devastation that when she touched the Spear of Gudra, she heard the voices of her valkyrie ancestors who demanded Warmaster destroy the amazons who had betrayed them.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #752 (2020)</ref> Warmaster later traveled to Canada and recruited Armageddon, a descendant of [[ogre]]s that had previously fought Wonder Woman.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #753 (2020)</ref> Lastly, Warmaster released [[Genocide (comics)|Genocide]] from her tomb deep within a cave near the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]].<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #754 (2020)</ref>

While Devastation and Armageddon battled Donna Troy, Warmaster summoned Wonder Woman to her base in Norway. There, she battled Wonder Woman and managed to pierce the superheroine's shoulder with the Spear of Gudra. She threatened to have Genocide kill all the heroes guarding the portal to Themyscira unless Wonder Woman opened it and allowed her inside.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #755 (2020)</ref> When Wonder Woman refused Paula fled, collapsing the building atop of Wonder Woman, but she was rescued by Donna Troy who had manged to defeat Devastation and Armageddon. Despite Wonder Woman's refusal to help, Genocide managed to force her way into Themyscira with Paula who battled the Amazons upon their arrival. Wonder Woman and Donna joined the fight quickly with Donna battling Genocide alongside the Amazon [[Nubia (character)|Nubia]], while Wonder Woman duelled Paula.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #757 (2020)</ref> Eventually Wonder Woman managed to persuade Paula that neither of them truly new if it was the Amazons or Valkyries that instigated the fight which killed Paula's ancestors. Paula yielded and Donna was able to defeat Genocide. While a [[Phantom Stranger]] appeared to try and claim Paula's soul for the sins of her ancestor, Wonder Woman manged to fend him off and Paula volunteered to stay in Themyscira to be reformed, believing that the only thing she could truly trust was Wonder Woman's word.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #758 (2020)</ref>

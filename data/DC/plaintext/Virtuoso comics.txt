The Suicide Squad's roster has always been one of reformed and/or incarcerated felons promised commuted sentences in return for participation in high-risk missions. The Squad's lineup has changed many times over the years, since its creation in 1959, and this list groups membership by the team's various eras and incarnations. Bolded names indicate current Suicide Squad members.
First appearance is the issue where the character first appeared as a member of a particular Suicide Squad incarnation. It is not necessarily the first appearance of the character in print, nor the story depicting how the character joined the Squad. The Squad was made up by five members.

Fictional character biographies


Dr. Joar Mahkent
When noted European physicist Dr. Joar Mahkent arrived in America with his latest scientific discovery, spectators at dockside were astonished to witness the luxury liner upon which Mahkent was traveling suddenly frozen solid in Gotham Harbor. Investigating this phenomenon, the original Green Lantern (Alan Scott) was shocked by the sight of Dr. Mahkent shot dead in his stateroom, apparently the victim of Lanky Leeds, a notorious racketeer who was reportedly traveling on the same ship. Thus, when the bizarrely costumed criminal known as the Icicle appeared upon the scene later that same day, wielding a unique weapon capable of instantly freezing solid any moisture in the air, Green Lantern presumed he was actually Lanky Leeds, who had stolen Doctor Mahkent's invention. After several frustrating encounters, Green Lantern ultimately unmasked the Icicle as Joar Mahkent himself, who had, in fact, murdered Lanky Leeds, using his cold ray gun to temporarily disguise Leeds' face as his own. Attempting to escape from Green Lantern, the Icicle leaped off a 20-story building and apparently plunged to his death in the Gotham River far below.Actually, the Icicle survived his fall into the river, and returned to plague the Emerald Gladiator time and time again, eventually becoming a member of the Wizard's second Injustice Society of the World which succeeded in briefly hypnotizing the Justice Society of America. During their Patriotic Crimes, the Icicle stole the Washington Monument. Later he was a founding member of the Crime Champions of Two Earths, along with the Wizard and the Fiddler, which teamed up with a trio of crooks from Earth-1 after the Fiddler accidentally discovered a way to travel between worlds. The Icicle committed a million-dollar robbery on Earth-2 and escaped Hourman and Doctor Fate. He was defeated by Doctor Fate while robbing a museum on Earth-1. The Justice League and the Justice Society were captured and imprisoned in cages in space by the Crime Champions though, but escaped with the help of the Green Lanterns. All the villains were then captured.
The Icicle met his death during the Crisis on Infinite Earths, when he and several other supervillains attempted to invade the laboratory of the renegade Oan known as Krona.
The storyline Batman: Hush revealed that, as young children, Bruce Wayne and Thomas Elliot witnessed a fight between Alan Scott and the Icicle during a visit in Metropolis, which inspired both of them to consider the importance of the tactical expertise that they would use in their future costumed careers.
Joar Mahkent has been identified as one of the deceased villains entombed below the Hall of Justice.


Cameron Mahkent
Cameron Mahkent has no need for a cold ray gun as his father's prolonged exposure to the weapon altered his genetics, allowing him to biologically pass down to his son the ability to freeze objects and people or to lower the temperature of a room or other area. Cameron's skin pigmentation was also affected, making him appear to be albino.Cameron became the second Icicle shortly before joining the Wizard's Injustice Unlimited group. It was during the period of the DC miniseries Legends (1986), the people of America were turned against their heroes, and a law was made that no one could operate as a crimefighter legally wearing a costume. This did not affect the villains much, as they were already breaking the law. For the new Icicle, it proved an opportune time to join with other super-criminals. He joined the Wizard in his new Injustice Society â€“ called Injustice Unlimited. The group overcame the security at the International Trade Conference in Calgary, Alberta, Canada - namely Infinity, Inc. and a contingent of the Global Guardians - and forced the heroes to help in some mayhem. The Icicle was given the mission of finding and retrieving the man-monster called Solomon Grundy. He took with him the still-hypnotized Icemaiden and Jade and they traveled to the Arctic Circle. They were successful in the mission and brought back the white-skinned behemoth to Calgary, just in time to interfere with the escape plans of the Wizard. The plan of blackmailing the wealthy businessmen went haywire when Hourman (Rick Tyler) revived and freed himself. In the confusion of the battle, however, Cameron was able to escape.Only weeks later he again joined with Artemis and Hazard, as well as the new Harlequin, the Dummy and Solomon Grundy. The Dummy wanted to head a revived Injustice Unlimited and planned to murder the members of Infinity Inc. to make a name for themselves. Their first target - Skyman - was successfully killed by the Harlequin and then Icicle went after Brainwave Jr. After believing the mental mutant dead, the Icicle returned to his cohorts. A plan was hatched to bring all the remaining Infinitors to Stellar Studios and kill them, a plan defeated only by the unwillingness of Hazard to cooperate and the sudden reappearance of Brainwave Jr. and Jade (both of whom had been thought dead). The Icicle nearly killed Brainwave Jr. in hand-to-hand combat, but was knocked out by Jade. In the end, Cameron was given over to law enforcement.Later, after he engaged in battle against the second Star-Spangled Kid, S.T.R.I.P.E. and Starman, he joined the new Injustice Society at the invitation of Johnny Sorrow, who released him from his prison cell. During Stealing Thunder, when the Ultra-Humanite remade the world after acquiring control of Johnny Thunder's Thunderbolt, he was forced to help the 'reserve JSA'- consisting of Captain Marvel, Hourman, the third Crimson Avenger, Power Girl, Sand and Jakeem Thunder- against the Ultra-Humanite, since they were the only other people free in the world created by the Ultra-Humanite. He was later offered a position in the JSA by Sand but turned him down saying that he only fought with Sand for his own reasons.
Cameron does not care about his father's Golden age villainous legacy. He became a villain, not because of legacy, but because he is not a nice guy. He is a far more ruthless foe than his predecessor. He has begun a relationship with his teammate, the Tigress.
As part of the Superman/Batman "Public Enemies" arc, the Icicle is part of a multi-villain attack on Superman and Batman in Washington D.C. Despite working with other cold themed villains such as Killer Frost and Captain Cold and having the backing of President Lex Luthor, the Icicle and all the villains are soundly defeated.
During the Infinite Crisis storyline, Cameron popped up as a member of Alexander Luthor, Jr.'s Secret Society of Super Villains.
One Year Later, he is approached by Mirror Master to join the Suicide Squad for a mission.
On the cover of Justice League of America #13 (vol. 2), it shows Icicle as a member of the new Injustice League, though this was not corroborated by the story.
He can seen as the member of Libra's Secret Society of Super Villains.
Icicle and Tigress appear in the "Hourman and Liberty Belle" Second Feature in JSA All Stars. The story involves them alternately working with and against the heroic couple in a quest to locate a magical artifact. He and Tigress are expecting a baby, which appears to threaten Tigress' health. Icicle is trying to 'raise' money for expensive treatments.In 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. The Green Team encountered Icicle on a meteor which he hijacked from Bellachek Temple to give to his client. He begins to attack the Green Team by freezing their shuttle. As Icicle continues his attack, he kills Paul who recognizes Icicle as Cameron. Icicle continues the attack until the meteor breaks into different fragments.In 2016, DC Comics implemented another relaunch of its books called "DC Rebirth", which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to "The New 52". Icicle appears at a villain award show at the Hall of Doom that is hosted by Harley Quinn.

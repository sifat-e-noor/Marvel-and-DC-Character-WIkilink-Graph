Hero Hotline is a fictional DC Comics corporate superteam introduced in Action Comics Weekly #637 (cover-dated January 1989). It was created by Bob Rozakis and Stephen DeStefano.


History
Hero Hotline is a corporate 24/7 hero for hire company created by the Coordinator, a man who was secretly World War II hero Harry "Tex" Thompson the Americommando. The Coordinator only communicates with the agency as a shadowy figure on a communication screen. Their hotline number is 1-800-555-HERO. They regularly take on the smaller missions from the common man; on occasion they have to fight the odd supervillain.


Infinite Crisis

Years after their own series ended, Hero Hotline was revealed to still be active in Teen Titans Annual #1 (March 2006), mentioned in passing as being among the heroes aiding in the evacuation of Bl√ºdhaven during Infinite Crisis.
The member 'Private Eyes' is seen in the realm of Limbo, participating in a multi-hero battle against the forces of a cosmic vampire.

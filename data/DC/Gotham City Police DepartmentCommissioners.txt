'''Gotham City''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ɒ|θ|əm}} {{respell|GOTH|əm}}), or simply '''Gotham''', is a [[fictional city]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]], best known as the home of the [[superhero]] [[Batman]] and his [[List of Batman supporting characters#Bat-Family|allies]] and [[List of Batman family enemies|foes]]. Created by writer [[Bill Finger]] and artist [[Bob Kane]], the city was first identified as Batman's place of residence in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #4 (December 1940) and has since been the primary setting for stories featuring the character.

Gotham City is traditionally depicted as being located in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New Jersey]].<ref name="DC Comics' 1977">''Amazing World of DC Comics'' #14, March 1977.

==Origin of name==
Writer [[Bill Finger]], on the naming of the city, said, "Originally I was going to call Gotham City '[[Civic City]].' Then I tried 'Capital City,' then '[[Coast City]].' Then I flipped through the New York City phone book and spotted the name 'Gotham Jewelers' and said, 'That's it,' Gotham City. We didn't call it New York because we wanted anybody in any city to identify with it."<ref name=NYTimes/><ref>{{cite book |author-link=Jim Steranko |last=Steranko |first=Jim |title=The Steranko History of Comics |publisher=Supergraphics |location=Reading, PA |year=1970 |isbn=978-0-517-50188-7 |page=44}}</ref>

"Gotham" has been a [[nicknames of New York City|nickname for New York City]] that first became popular in the nineteenth century; [[Washington Irving]] had first attached it to New York in the November 11, 1807 edition of his ''[[Salmagundi (periodical)|Salmagundi]]'',<ref name=HistoryOfNYC>Burrows, Edwin G. and Mike Wallace. ''Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898''. (Oxford University Press, 1999), 417.</ref> a periodical which lampooned New York culture and politics. Irving took the name from the village of [[Gotham, Nottinghamshire]], England: a place inhabited, according to folklore, by fools.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-got1.htm |title= Gotham |publisher= World Wide Words |date= February 6, 1999 |access-date= July 13, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-24760791 |title=The real Gotham: The village behind the Batman stories |date=January 1, 2014 |last=Lowbridge |first=Caroline |work=BBC News |access-date=June 20, 2015 }}</ref>

==Geography==
===Location in New Jersey===

Gotham City, like other cities in the DC Universe, has varied in its portrayals over the decades, but the city's location is traditionally depicted as being in the state of [[New Jersey]]. In ''Amazing World of DC Comics'' #14 (March 1977), publisher [[Mark Gruenwald]] discusses the history of the [[Justice League]] and indicates that Gotham City is located in New Jersey.<ref name="DC Comics' 1977"/>

In ''The World's Greatest Super Heroes'' (August 13, 1978) comic strip, a map is shown placing Gotham City in New Jersey and [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] in Delaware.<ref>''The World's Greatest Super Heroes'', August 13, 1978. DC Comics.</ref> ''World's Finest Comics'' #259 (November 1979) also confirms that Gotham is in New Jersey.<ref>''World's Finest Comics'' #259, October–November 1979</ref> ''The New Adventures of Superboy'' #22 (October 1981) and the 1990 ''Atlas of the DC Universe'' both show maps of Gotham City in New Jersey and Metropolis in the state of [[Delaware]].<ref name="ifanboy.com"/><ref>''The New Adventures of Superboy'' #14, October 1981. DC Comics.</ref>

''Detective Comics'' #503 (June 1983) includes several references suggesting Gotham City is in New Jersey. A location on the [[Jersey Shore]] is described as "twenty miles north of Gotham". Within the same issue, [[Robin (character)|Robin]] and [[Batgirl]] drive from a "secret New Jersey airfield" to Gotham City and then drive on the "Hudson County Highway", a reference to the real-life [[Hudson County]] in New Jersey.

''Batman: Shadow of the Bat'' Annual #1 (June 1993) further establishes that Gotham City is in New Jersey. Sal E. Jordan's driver's license in the comic shows his address as "72 Faxcol Dr Gotham City, NJ 12345",<ref name="Batman 1993"/> although the [[ZIP Code]] is actually in [[Schenectady]], New York.

The 2016 film ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' reveals Gotham City to be in the state of New Jersey within the [[DC Extended Universe]].<ref name="APP">{{cite news|url=http://www.app.com/story/entertainment/movies/2016/08/05/review-suicide-squad-another-super-dc-mess/88286868/|title=Review: 'Suicide Squad'|date=August 5, 2016|newspaper=Asbury Park Press}}</ref><ref name="CBR">{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/suicide-squad-the-biggest-revelations-from-the-latest-dc-film|title="Suicide Squad": The Biggest Revelations From The Latest DC Film|date=August 7, 2016|publisher=[[CBR.com]]}}</ref>

===In relation to Metropolis===

Gotham City is the home of [[Batman]], just as [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] is home to [[Superman]], and the two heroes often work together in both cities. In comic book depictions, the exact distance between Gotham and Metropolis has varied over the years, with the cities usually being within driving distance of each other. The two cities are sometimes portrayed as [[twin cities]] on opposite sides of the [[Delaware Bay]], with Gotham in New Jersey and Metropolis in Delaware.<ref name="WorldsFinest1979"/><ref name="DC Universe 1990"/> ''[[The Atlas of the DC Universe]]'' from the 1990s places Metropolis in Delaware and Gotham City in New Jersey.<ref name="ifanboy.com"/>

New York has also garnered the [[List of nicknames of New York City|nickname]] ''Metropolis'' to describe the city in the daytime in popular culture, contrasting with ''Gotham'', sometimes used to describe New York City at night.<ref name=NYCDailyNewsNicknames>{{cite news|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/gotham-metropolis-nyc-best-nicknames-article-1.2556511|title=From Gotham to Metropolis: A look at NYC's best nicknames|first=Keri|last=Blakinger|newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York|date=March 8, 2016|access-date=March 1, 2021|archive-date=March 9, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309110319/https://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/gotham-metropolis-nyc-best-nicknames-article-1.2556511}}</ref> During the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books]], the Metro-Narrows Bridge was depicted as the main route connecting the twin cities of Metropolis and Gotham City.<ref>''DC Comics Presents'' #18, February 1980</ref><ref name="superboy22">''The New Adventures of Superboy'' #22, October 1981</ref> It has been described as being the longest [[suspension bridge]] in the world.<ref>''[[Action Comics]]'' #451, September 1975.

Within the DC Extended Universe, the 2016 film ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' depicts Gotham City as being located across a bay from Metropolis.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://screenertv.com/movies/batman-v-superman-where-are-metropolis-gotham-city-located/ | title='Batman v Superman': Are Metropolis and Gotham City that close?| date=March 25, 2016 |work=[[Screenertv.com]]}}</ref>

==History==
A [[Norwegian colonization of the Americas|Norwegian]] mercenary, Captain Jon Logerquist, founded Gotham City in 1635 and the British later took it over—a story that parallels the founding of New York by the Dutch (as [[New Amsterdam]]) and later takeover by the British.<ref>''Atlas of the DC Universe''. Mayfair Games.</ref>  During the [[American Revolutionary War]], Gotham City was the site of a major battle (paralleling the real-life [[Battle of Long Island|Battle of Brooklyn]]). This was detailed in [[Rick Veitch]]'s ''Swamp Thing'' #85 featuring [[Tomahawk (comics)|Tomahawk]]. Rumors held it to be the site of various [[occult]] rites.

[[File:Gotham-City-1881.jpg|thumb|275px|left|Gotham City in 1881 from ''Batman: Gates of Gotham'' (April 2011). Art by Trevor McCarthy.]]
The 2011 comic book series ''[[Batman: Gates of Gotham]]'' details a history of Gotham City in which Alan Wayne (Bruce Wayne's ancestor), Theodore Cobblepot ([[The Penguin|Oswald Cobblepot]]'s ancestor), and Edward Elliot ([[Hush (comics)|Thomas Elliot]]'s ancestor), are considered the founding fathers of Gotham. In 1881, they constructed three bridges called the Gates of Gotham, each bearing one of their last names.  Edward Elliot became increasingly jealous of the Wayne family's popularity and wealth during this period, jealousy that would spread to his great-great-grandson, Thomas Elliot or Hush.<ref>'''Batman: Gates to Gotham'', May 2011. DC Comics.</ref>

The occult origins of Gotham are further delved into by [[Peter Milligan]]'s 1990 story arc "Dark Knight, Dark City",<ref>{{cite web|author=Burgas, Greg|title=Dark Knight, Dark City|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/04/13/comics-you-should-own-flashback-batman-452-454/|date=April 13, 2010|website=[[Comic Book Resources]]}}</ref> which reveals that some of the American [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] are involved in summoning a bat-demon which becomes trapped beneath old "Gotham Town", its dark influence spreading as Gotham City evolves. A similar trend is followed in 2005's ''[[Shadowpact]]'' #5 by [[Bill Willingham]], which expands upon Gotham's [[demonization|occult]] heritage by revealing a being who has slept for 40,000 years beneath the land upon which Gotham City was built. Strega, the being's servant, says that the "dark and often cursed character" of the city was influenced by the being who now uses the name "Doctor Gotham."

In ''[[Gotham Underground]]'' #2 by [[Frank Tieri (comics)|Frank Tieri]], [[Tobias Whale]] claims that 19th century Gotham was run by five rival gangs, until the first "masks" appeared, eventually forming a gang of their own. It is not clear whether these were vigilantes or costumed criminals.

Many storylines have added more events to Gotham's history, at the same time greatly affecting the city and its people. Perhaps the greatest in effect was a long set of serial storylines, which started with [[Ra's al Ghul]] releasing a debilitating virus called the "Clench" during the "[[Batman: Contagion|Contagion]]" storyline. As that arc concluded, the city was beginning to recover, only to suffer an earthquake measuring 7.6 on the [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter Scale]] in the 1998 "[[Batman: Cataclysm|Cataclysm]]" storyline. This resulted in the federal government cutting Gotham off from the rest of the United States in the 1999 storyline "[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]", the city's remaining residents forced to engage in gang warfare, either as active participants or paying for protection from groups ranging from the GCPD to the Penguin, just to stay alive. Eventually, Gotham was rebuilt and returned to the U.S. as part of a campaign mounted by [[Lex Luthor]], who used the positive publicity of his role to make a successful bid for the position of President of the United States.{{issue|date=June 2021}}

Suggestions of other Gotham City histories include a founding date of 1820 seen in a city seal in ''[[Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders]]''.

==Culture==
''Batman'' writer and editor [[Dennis O'Neil]] has said that, figuratively, Batman's Gotham City is akin to "Manhattan below 14th Street at eleven minutes past midnight on the coldest night in November".<ref>O'Neil, Dennis. Afterword. ''Batman: Knightfall, A Novel''. New York: Bantam Books. 1994. 344.</ref> Batman artist [[Neal Adams]] has long believed that Chicago has been the basis for Gotham, stating "one of the things about Chicago is Chicago has alleys (which are virtually nonexistent in New York). Back alleys, that's where Batman fights all the bad guys."<ref name=Today>{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/id/25774413#.UzZCF8d4Q9U|title=Dark Knight's kind of town: Gotham City|date=July 20, 2008|website=Today|publisher=Associated Press|access-date=March 29, 2014|archive-date=October 6, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006122822/http://www.today.com/id/25774413#.UzZCF8d4Q9U|url-status=dead}}</ref> The statement "Metropolis is New York by day; Gotham City is New York by night" has been variously attributed to comics creators [[Frank Miller]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]].<ref name="Bopik"/>

In designing ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', creators [[Bruce Timm]] and [[Eric Radomski]] emulated the Tim Burton films' "otherworldly timelessness," incorporating period features such as black-and-white [[title card]]s, police [[airship]]s (although no such thing existed, Timm has stated that he found it to fit the show's style), and a "vintage" color scheme with [[film noir]] flourishes.<ref name="LeatherWingsComm">Bruce Timm and Eric Radomski, audio commentary for "On Leather Wings", ''Batman: The Animated Series'', Warner Bros, Volume One box set DVD.</ref> Police airships have since been incorporated into Batman comic books and are a recurring element in Gotham City.<ref name="Batman' 2011"/>

Concerning the evolution of Gotham throughout the years, [[Paul Levitz]], ''Batman'' editor and former [[DC Comics]] president, has stated "each guy adds their own vision. That's the fun of comics, rebuilding a city each time".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.today.com/id/25774413/ns/today-today_entertainment/t/dark-knights-kind-town-gotham-city/|title=Dark Knight's kind of town: Gotham City|last=Bros|first=Warner|date=2008-07-20|website=TODAY.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27|archive-date=February 18, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200218191340/http://www.today.com/id/25774413/ns/today-today_entertainment/t/dark-knights-kind-town-gotham-city|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Architecture===
[[File:Helsinki Railway station towe&statues.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Art Deco]] and [[Art Nouveau]] buildings, such as [[Helsinki Central Railway Station]], inspired the look of Gotham in the 1989 film ''Batman''.<ref>{{cite news|author=Travel |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/760478/Helsinki-a-cruisers-guide.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220111/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/760478/Helsinki-a-cruisers-guide.html |archive-date=January 11, 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=Helsinki: a cruiser's guide |newspaper=Telegraph |date= February 27, 2008|access-date=May 14, 2013}}{{cbignore}}</ref>]]
In ''[[Batman: Gothic]]'', Gotham Cathedral plays a central role for the story, as it is built by Mr Whisper, the story's antagonist.

In a 1992 storyline, a man obsessed with Pinkney's architecture blew up several Gotham buildings in order to reveal the Pinkney structures they had hidden; the editorial purpose behind this was to transform the city depicted in the comics to resemble the designs created by [[Anton Furst]] for the 1989 ''Batman'' film.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Grant, Alan | Artist = [[Norm Breyfogle|Breyfogle, Norm]]| Story = The Destroyer Part One: A Tale of Two Cities| Title = [[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]|Issue = 474|date=February 1992| Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic| Writer = Grant, Alan|Penciller = [[Chris Sprouse|Sprouse, Chris]]| Inker = Patterson, Bruce| Copencillers = Anton Furst|Story = The Destroyer Part Two: Solomon|Title = [[Legends of the Dark Knight]]| Issue = 27|date=February 1992| Publisher = DC Comics }}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic| Writer =Grant, Alan| Penciller = [[Jim Aparo|Aparo, Jim]]| Inker = [[Mike DeCarlo|DeCarlo, Mike]]|Story =The Destroyer Part Three| Title = [[Detective Comics]]| Issue = #641|date=February 1992| Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>

''Batman Begins'' features a CGI-augmented version of Chicago while ''The Dark Knight'' more directly features Chicago infrastructure and architecture such as [[Navy Pier]].

==Notable residents==
Over the years, in various Batman-related titles in the chronological [[DC Comics]] continuity, the Caped Crusader enlists the help of numerous characters, the first being his trusty sidekick, [[Robin (character)|Robin]]. Although a singular title, many have donned the mantle of the Boy Wonder over the years. The first being [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]], then came [[Jason Todd|Red Hood]], [[Tim Drake|Red Robin]], and finally Batman's son [[Damian Wayne]].

===Television===
The [[Batman (TV series)|1960s live-action ''Batman'' television series]] never specified Gotham's location, though there are hints it actually represents New York City, including a city map and its location across the "West River" from "Guernsey City" in "New Guernsey".

In the TV series ''[[Smallville]]'', Gotham City is mentioned by the character Linda Lake in the episode "Hydro", who jokes she can see Gotham from her view. In "Reunion", one of Oliver Queen's friends mentions having to get back to Gotham.

The fifth episode of ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'', entitled "Schooled", indicates that Gotham is located in [[Connecticut]], near [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]].

====DC Animated Universe====
{{main|DC Animated Universe}}
Gotham City is featured heavily in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' and ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' (where by then in the future is known as Neo-Gotham) and makes cameo appearances in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]], [[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]], [[Justice League Unlimited]]'' and ''[[Static Shock]]''. When describing Gotham City [[Paul Dini]], a writer and director of the show, stated "In my mind, it was sort of like what if the 1939 World's Fair had gone on another 60 years or so".<ref name=DenOfGeek/>' In the episode "[[Joker's Favor (Batman: The Animated Series)|Joker's Favor]]", a driver's license lists a Gotham area resident's hometown as "Gotham Estates, [[New York (state)|NY]]". In the episode [[List of Batman: The Animated Series episodes|"Avatar"]], when Bruce Wayne leaves for England, a map shows Gotham City, at the joining of Long Island and the Hudson River. The episode [[List of Batman: The Animated Series episodes|"Fire from Olympus"]] shows a character's address in a police file indicating that Gotham City is located in New York state. The episode [[List of Batman: The Animated Series episodes|"The Mechanic"]], however, implies that Gotham resides in a state of the same name; a prison workshop is shown stamping license plates that read "Gotham: The Dark Deco State" (as a reference to the artistic style of the series). The episode "[[Harlequinade (Batman: The Animated Series)|Harlequinade]]" states that Gotham City has a population of approximately 10 million people. This figure was also given in the 1960s ''Batman'' TV series episode "[[Egg Grows in Gotham]]", the thirteenth episode of the second season.

====Arrowverse====
{{main|Arrowverse}}
Gotham City was first shown in the [[Arrowverse]] as part of "[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]", a 2018 [[fictional crossover|crossover]] storyline among the shows, which introduced [[Batwoman]], although it had been referred to several times previously.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/batwoman-make-arrow-verse-debut-next-crossover-1112799 |title=Batwoman to Make in 'Arrow'-verse Debut in Next Crossover |last=Goldberg |first=Lesley |work=Hollywood Reporter |date=May 17, 2018 |access-date=May 17, 2018}}</ref>

In ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' episode "Marathon", a map shows Gotham City in place of Chicago, Illinois.

====Theme parks====
Themed lands meant to represent Gotham City have been physically constructed in several different theme parks around the world. WB Movie World in Germany featured a Gotham City section that housed [[Batman Adventure – The Ride]], and [[Six Flags Magic Mountain]] opened a section called the "Gotham City Backlot" that featured [[Batman: The Ride]]. The section featured at Magic Mountain was designed by park designer Kevin Barbee, and alongside the opening of Batman: The Ride coincided with the largest expansion the park had ever undergone in 23 years, with the theming elements primarily having been inspired by the ''Batman'' films directed by Tim Burton. Both the ride and the Gotham City Backlot opened on March 26, 1994.<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-03-26-ca-38648-story.html Batman Scales the Mountain: Gotham City Area, Roller Coaster Are Largest Expansion in Magic Mountain’s 23-Year History at the Los Angeles Times]</ref>

The Magic Mountain section closed at the end of the park's 2010 season and was later rethemed and rebranded as the "DC Universe," featuring characters and attractions outside of just Batman. It reopened in 2011.

[[Warner Bros. World Abu Dhabi]] features a section themed after Gotham City, including rides based on Batman, the Riddler and the Scarecrow as well as a walk-through attraction called "The Joker's Funhouse." The park and its Gotham City section were designed by [[Thinkwell Group]].<ref>[https://thinkwellgroup.com/project/warner-bros-world-abu-dhabi/ Warner Bros. World Abu Dhabi at Thinkwell Group]</ref> DC characters as they appear in both the attractions themselves as well as through live performers feature costumes based on [[The New 52]] comic book relaunch from 2011. The Gotham City section neighbors another section themed after [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], home of [[Superman]].

====The Dark Knight Trilogy====
{{main|The Dark Knight Trilogy}}
Director Christopher Nolan has stated that [[Chicago]] inspired his portrayal of Gotham, and the majority of both ''[[Batman Begins]]'' (2005) and ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' (2008) were filmed there.<ref name=Today/> However, Christopher Nolan's Gotham City was deliberately set in New Jersey to honor Gotham's location in the comic books.<ref name=Distractify>{{cite web|url= https://www.distractify.com/p/the-batman-filming-locations |title= These Are the Cities Standing in for Gotham in 'The Batman' |publisher= Distractify |date= March 4, 2022 |access-date= March 6, 2022}}</ref>

In ''[[Batman Begins]]'', Nolan desired that Gotham appeared as a large, modern city that nonetheless reflected a variety of architecture styles and periods, as well as different socioeconomic strata. The production's approach depicted Gotham as an exaggeration of New York City, with elements taken from Chicago, the elevated freeways and monorails of [[Tokyo]],<ref name=IGNInterview>{{cite web | first=Jeff | last=Otto | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/622/622719p1.html | title=Interview: Christopher Nolan | website=IGN | date=June 5, 2006 | access-date=November 6, 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331134903/http://movies.ign.com/articles/622/622719p1.html | archive-date=March 31, 2012 | url-status=dead }}</ref> and the "[[Kowloon Walled City|walled city of Kalhoon]]"{{sic}} in [[Hong Kong]], which was the basis for the slum in the film known as The Narrows.<ref name=WorldwideBBegins/><ref name=IGNInterview/>

In ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'', more Chicago and New York influences were observed. On filming in Chicago, James McAllister, key location manager stated, "visually it's that look like you would see in the comic books." Nolan also stated "there's all these different boroughs, with rivers to interconnect. I think it's hard to get away from that, because Gotham is based on New York."<ref name=Today/>

For ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' (2012), the production utilized [[Pittsburgh]], [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City]], [[Newark, New Jersey]], [[London]] and [[Glasgow]] for shots of Gotham City.<ref name=Reelz/><ref name=PittPostGazette/><ref name=MTV/><ref name=NJ.com1/><ref name=NewYorkPost/><ref name=NJ.com2/>

{{Main|Joker (2019 film)}}
''[[Joker (2019 film)|Joker]]'' director and producer [[Todd Phillips]] imagined Gotham as a "version of Gotham was the pre-'80s boom New York, or urban northeastern center, but not the iconic New York." When asked how he re-imagined the city, production designer Mark Friedberg stated "our version of Gotham was what groomed him. It was both an appreciation for how severe things got in the city, but also for the world of possibility that lived in the version of that city."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.backstage.com/magazine/article/joker-gotham-production-designer-interview-mark-friedberg-69053/|title=The Design of 'Joker' Just Might Make You Sympathize With the Villain|date=2019-09-25|website=www.backstage.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>

During the events of the [[direct-to-video]] film ''[[Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]'' (1998), a computer screen displaying [[Barbara Gordon]]'s personal information refers to her location as "Gotham City, NY", and also displays her area code as being 212 – a [[Manhattan]] area code.

''[[Batman Beyond]]'' (1999–2001) envisions a Gotham City in 2039, referred to as "Neo-Gotham".

Gotham City appears in several video games, including ''[[Batman Begins (video game)|Batman Begins]]'', ''[[DC Universe Online]]'', and ''[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]''. The city makes another appearance in a video game with ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'', where the player can fight outside or inside of [[Wayne Manor]], on top of a building and in an alley. Other games that feature the city include ''[[Lego Dimensions]]'' and Rocksteady's ''Arkham'' franchise.

====Batman: Arkham====
{{main|Batman: Arkham}}
''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'' (2009) opens with Batman driving [[Joker (character)|Joker]] from Gotham City to [[Arkham Asylum]]. Joker also threatens to detonate bombs across Gotham. In ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'' (2011), the slums of Old Gotham City (the northern island) were converted into Arkham City. Inside the prison walls, this part of Gotham contains various landmarks throughout the story, like [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]]'s Iceberg Lounge, the Ace Chemical Plant, the [[Black Mask (comics)|Sionis]] Steel Mill, the Old Gotham City Police Department building, and the Monarch Theatre with the Wayne murder scene in Crime Alley. Most of these locations have major events in the story. In ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'' (2013), an earlier, younger version of the city can be seen than that of other games in the ''Batman: Arkham'' series. In addition to the northern island, this installment in the series lets players explore a new southern island, connected to the former by the Pioneer's Bridge. The setting of ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'' (2015), Central Gotham City, is five times larger than Old Gotham. In the novelization for ''Batman: Arkham Knight'', it is revealed that Crime Alley was later renamed Wayne Way months after the 'death' of Batman.

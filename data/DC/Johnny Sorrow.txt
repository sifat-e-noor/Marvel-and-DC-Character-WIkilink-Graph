Soon after, Yellow Wasp kidnapped Wildcat's son, Jake. Rather than slaying the hero's child, Yellow Wasp began to think kindly of Jake, raising him as a (some would say favorite) son. Killer Wasp soon killed the two in a fit of jealousy. Shortly afterward, he joined the [[Injustice Society]] formed by Johnny Sorrow.<ref>{{citation|title=The Supervillain Book: The Evil Side of Comics and Hollywood|page=176|year=2006|editor=Gina Renée Misiroglu, Michael Eury|publisher=Visible Ink Press|isbn=9780780809772}}</ref> The group of supervillains attacked JSA headquarters while most of the team was out, with only Wildcat in the building.

In the end, Wildcat was victorious.

During the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' storyline, Killer Wasp popped up as a member of [[Alexander Luthor Jr.]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].

Killer Wasp shows up again in ''JSA All Stars'' #2, again fighting under the command of Johnny Sorrow, as part of the [[Injustice Society]]. He is killed shortly after when Johnny cuts open his chest and removes his heart.

'''''Batman: The Animated Series''''' (often shortened as '''''Batman TAS''''' or '''''BTAS''''') is an American [[Superhero fiction|superhero]] animated television series based on the [[DC Comics]] superhero [[Batman]]. Developed by [[Bruce Timm]], [[Paul Dini]], and [[Mitch Brian]], and produced by [[Warner Bros. Animation]], it originally aired on [[Fox Kids]] from September 5, 1992, to September 15, 1995, with a total of 85 episodes.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Erickson |first1=Hal |title=Television Cartoon Shows: An Illustrated Encyclopedia, 1949 Through 2003 |date=2005 |edition=2nd |publisher=McFarland & Co |isbn=978-1476665993 |pages=114–122}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= A History of Batman on TV|work= IGN|url= https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/07/17/a-history-of-batman-on-tv|access-date=June 10, 2020}}</ref> In 1994, the series began airing under the on-screen title '''''The Adventures of Batman & Robin''''', which was also used for Fox Kids' re-runs of earlier episodes. In 1997, the series continued on [[Kids' WB]] as ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', lasting 24 episodes. Despite featuring a different animation style and character redesigns, it has often been included in the same home video releases and syndicated re-run packages, thus bringing the total episode count to 109.

''Batman: The Animated Series'' was praised for its darker tone, mature writing, and thematic complexity compared to previous superhero cartoon shows, in addition to its artistic presentation, [[film noir]] aesthetics, voice acting, orchestrated soundtrack, and modernization of its title character.<ref name="greatestcartoons">[https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/01/26/the-greatest-comic-book-cartoons-of-all-time "The Greatest Comic Book Cartoons of All Time"].

Another continuation of the series is in development in the form of an audio podcast drama, with most of the cast returning along with writer [[Alan Burnett]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/batman-the-animated-series-audio-drama-podcast-1235057158/|title=‘Batman: The Animated Series’ Audio Drama in the Works With Original Cast|date=December 4, 2021|website=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=December 9, 2021}}</ref>

==Overview==
The series took influence from [[Tim Burton]]'s live-action films, ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989) and ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992), and the acclaimed ''[[Superman (1940s cartoons)|Superman]]'' theatrical cartoons produced by [[Fleischer Studios]] in the early 1940s.<ref name="bof">[http://www.batman-on-film.com/historyofthebatman_tv_animated_btas.html Batman-On-Film] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722143405/http://www.batman-on-film.com/historyofthebatman_tv_animated_btas.html |date=July 22, 2010 }}, ''Batman: The Animated Series''.</ref> In designing the series, [[Bruce Timm]] and [[Eric Radomski]] emulated the Burton films' "otherworldly timelessness", incorporating period features such as black-and-white [[title card]]s, police [[airship]]s and a "vintage" color scheme with [[film noir]] flourishes.<ref name="LeatherWingsComm">Bruce Timm and Eric Radomski, audio commentary for "On Leather Wings", ''Batman: The Animated Series'', Warner Bros, Volume One box set DVD.</ref>

The visual style of the series was based on the artwork of Radomski, and the gothic look of [[Gotham City]] was derived from his initial designs.<ref>{{cite news|title= ''Batman: The Animated Series'' – Volume 1|work= DVD Talk|url= https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/11531/batman-the-animated-series-volume-1/|access-date=August 16, 2010}}</ref> In addition, Radomski issued a standing order to the animation department that all backgrounds be painted using light colors on black paper (as opposed to the industry standard of dark colors on white paper).<ref name="LeatherWingsComm" /> The distinctive visual combination of "noir" imagery and [[Art Deco]] design was dubbed "Dark Deco" by the producers.<ref name="btas">[http://www.batmantas.com/ ''Batman: The Animated Series''], an explanation of "Dark Deco".</ref>

The series initially took a variation of music written by [[Danny Elfman]] for the Burton films as its theme; later episodes of the series used a new theme with a similar style by [[Shirley Walker]], an occasional collaborator of Elfman. The score of the series was influenced by Elfman's work on the Burton films, as well as music of 1940s film noir.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbr.com/uncovered-batman-animated-series-art/ |title=Batman The Animated Series: 15 Uncovered Pieces Of Early Artwork |last=Roberson |first=Chris Chan |date=September 25, 2017 |website=Comic Book Resources |access-date=September 25, 2017}}</ref>

The series is more adult-oriented than many of the previous superhero cartoons, while still being considered kid-friendly appropriate for younger audiences. It depicts outright physical violence against antagonists, including realistic firearms (though only one character, [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]], was ever depicted as having been shot, in the episode "I Am the Night"). First-time producers Timm and Radomski reportedly encountered resistance from studio executives, but the success of Burton's first film allowed the embryonic series to survive long enough to produce a pilot episode, "[[On Leather Wings]]", which, according to Timm, "got a lot of people off our backs".<ref name="LeatherWingsComm"/> During the series' production, producer [[Alan Burnett]] wrote an episode without dialogue entitled "Silent Night" to explore more of Batman's sexual life, but this was never produced. Burnett also intended to make an episode featuring a [[Nocturna (DC Comics)|female vampire]] that would bite Batman to suck his blood, but plans never materialized.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/batman/btas/backstage/interviews/burnett.php|title=The World's Finest – Batman: The Animated Series|website=www.worldsfinestonline.com}}</ref>

The series is also notable for its supporting cast. Numerous known actors provided voices for a variety of recognizable villains. Most notable was [[Mark Hamill]], previously famous for his role as [[Luke Skywalker]] in the original ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy, whose prominence as a voice actor was heightened through his "cheerfully deranged" portrayal of the [[Joker (character)|Joker]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.awn.com/mag/issue2.1/articles/kubin2.1.html | title = An Interview With Mark Hamill | access-date =October 14, 2007| publisher = Animation World Magazine| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071012221837/http://www.awn.com/mag/issue2.1/articles/kubin2.1.html| archive-date= October 12, 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> The role was originally given to [[Tim Curry]], but he developed [[bronchitis]] during the initial recording sessions.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lis|first=Martin|url=http://www.screengeek.net/2017/09/02/tim-curry-reveals-why-mark-hamill-replaced-him-as-joker/|title=Exclusive: Tim Curry Reveals Why Mark Hamill Replaced Him as JOKER|publisher=ScreenGeek|date=September 2, 2017|access-date=September 6, 2017}}</ref> [[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]], who later voiced the Riddler, also auditioned for the Joker role. Hamill, who found himself to be the biggest fan of the Batman comics among the cast, credited the laughs he had honed on stage in ''[[Amadeus (play)|Amadeus]]'' with landing him the role.<ref name="HR25" /> The recording sessions, under the supervision of voice director [[Andrea Romano (voice director)|Andrea Romano]], were recorded with the actors together in one studio instead of taking separate recordings, as is typical. This method would later be employed for all subsequent series in the [[DC Animated Universe]]. [[Al Pacino]] was considered to voice [[Two-Face]] in the series, but he declined the offer;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://about-faces.livejournal.com/68401.html|title=The Origins of (the Origins of) Harvey Dent in "Batman: The Animated Series"|first=2012-01-24 16:40:00 About_faces About_faces January 24, 2012 16:40:00|last=About_faceswrote}}</ref> [[Richard Moll]] was instead cast in the role. Other actors included [[Ron Perlman]] as [[Clayface]], [[Roddy McDowall]] as the [[Mad Hatter (DC Comics)|Mad Hatter]], [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] as [[Ra's al Ghul]], [[Michael York]] as [[Count Vertigo]], [[Kate Mulgrew]] as Red Claw, [[George Murdock (actor)|George Murdock]] as [[List of DC Comics characters: B|Boss Biggis]], [[Ed Asner]] as Roland Daggett and [[George Dzundza]] as the [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Ventriloquist]].

One of the series' best-known inventions is the Joker's assistant, [[Harley Quinn]], who became so popular that DC Comics later added her to mainstream comic book continuity. [[Penguin (character)|The Penguin]] underwent change for the series; his appearance was remodeled after the version seen in ''[[Batman Returns]]'', which was in production simultaneously with the series' first season. New life was also given to lesser-known characters for the series, such as the [[Clock King]]. In addition, dramatic changes were made to other villains such as [[Clayface]] and [[Mr. Freeze]], the latter of whom was changed from a gimmicky [[mad scientist]] to a [[tragedy|tragic]] figure whose "frigid exterior [hid] a doomed love and vindictive fury".

==Characters==
The [[Joker (character)|Joker]]'s accomplice [[Harley Quinn]], Gotham City police detective [[Renee Montoya]], the vigilante [[Lock-Up (comics)|Lock-Up]], former actor Simon Trent, brainwashed comedian-turned-supervillain Condiment King, and ninja Kyodai Ken are original creations who became characters in the comics. Older villains that were lesser known from the comics, such as [[Count Vertigo]], the [[Weasand (comics)|Mirror Man]] and the [[Clock King]], were modified for the series in both appearance and personality. Other original antagonists were created, such as Roland Daggett, Red Claw, Lloyd Ventrix, the Sewer King, Boss Biggis, Grant Walker, H.A.R.D.A.C., and Emile Dorian, but to little acclaim, and did not make any appearances outside the series, though Daggett was re-imagined as businessman John Daggett for ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]''.

Aside from creating characters that crossed over into the main line of DC Comics, several of the series' reinterpretations were carried over as well. [[Mr. Freeze]] was revised in the comics to emulate the series' tragic story, the success of which actually compelled DC to bring the character back after "killing" him off some years earlier. [[Clayface]] was revised to be much more similar in appearance to his animated counterpart; and Two-Face's double-sided, black-and-white suit has become a common appearance for the character.

===Bruce Wayne / Batman===
[[File:Batmananimated32.png|thumb|upright|Batman as seen in the original opening theme sequence of the series.]]
At the age of eight, Bruce Wayne, the son of billionaire philanthropists, witnessed the murder of his parents, Thomas and Martha, during a mugging on the street. The event left him traumatized and mentally scarred for the rest of his life. This left Bruce to be cared for by his family's butler, Alfred Pennyworth. Over the years, Bruce slowly turned the pain and trauma he sustained into a burning fuel for a lifelong obsession, as he underwent rigorous training in mental and physical conditioning, the martial arts, criminology, sciences, manhunting, forensics, detective work, interrogation methods and intimidation, for the next years of his life. Having observed the rampant crime and corruption across Gotham City, he chose to deal with the crime-wave in Gotham in his own way, by using his years of training and swore an oath to dedicate his entire life to fighting crime, in a bid to avenge the murder of his parents and to use his pain and suffering to drive him to do good, while being guided by his self-enforced moral code to never kill and to refrain from using firearms. Inspired by the presence of bats, his childhood fear, which used to be present around his home, Bruce chose to undertake the alias of The Batman, a feared, near-mythical and bat-masked vigilante.

One of the most notable changes made in ''The Animated Series'' is the treatment of Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne. In nearly all other media, including the comics, television shows and films, Bruce deliberately plays up his image as a vacuous, self-absorbed and not-too-bright billionaire playboy.<ref name="fbf">[http://www.factbehindfiction.com/index_files/brucewayne.htm Fact Behind Fiction] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160628045507/http://www.factbehindfiction.com/index_files/brucewayne.htm |date=June 28, 2016 }}, Bruce Wayne biography.</ref> In ''The Animated Series'', his character is assertive, outwardly intelligent, and actively involved in the management of [[Wayne Enterprises]], without jeopardizing his secret identity. For example: in the episode "Eternal Youth", Bruce is shown angrily ordering one of his directors to cancel a deal with a timber company in the [[Amazon rainforest]] that had been made behind his back, threatening him with termination upon failure to comply.

[[Kevin Conroy]] used different voices to distinguish between his portrayal of Bruce Wayne and Batman, a tactic used previously by [[Michael Keaton]] in [[Tim Burton]]'s live-action films.<ref name="Murphy">{{cite web |last=Murphy |first=Joel |date=October 1, 2009 |title=One on One with Kevin Conroy |publisher=HoboTrashcan |url=http://www.hobotrashcan.com/2009/10/01/one-on-one-with-kevin-conroy}}</ref> Conroy based his dual-voice performance on the [[The Scarlet Pimpernel (1934 film)|1934 film adaptation of ''The Scarlet Pimpernel'']].<ref name="HR25">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/batman-animated-series-hirings-firings-last-minute-changes-1035120|title='Batman' at 25: Hirings, Firings and Other Last-Minute Changes Behind the Animated Classic|magazine=The Hollywood Reporter|date=September 5, 2017|access-date=July 17, 2018|author=Burton, Byron and Couch, Aaron}}</ref>

===Dick Grayson / Robin===
Dick Grayson's history in the show mirrors that in the comics: The episode "Robin's Reckoning" reveals that Grayson and his parents were acrobats in Haly's Circus. Following the tragic deaths of Grayson's parents at the hands of mobster Tony Zucco, Bruce Wayne adopts Dick and eventually takes him on as a protégé.

The series also redefined the original [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]/[[Dick Grayson]]. While much of Dick's past remains the same, his Robin costume is modernized with short sleeves and long [[tights]], exactly like [[Tim Drake]]'s original Robin outfit but with a non-italicized "R" symbol. In addition, Dick is given a more serious and mature personality to match the tone of the series (although he does have comedic moments occasionally). The episode "Batgirl Returns" establishes that Dick and [[Barbara Gordon]] attend the same college and that they are friends, but neither one knows the secret identity of the other. Their relationship is one of the plot elements of the film ''[[Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]''.

His changing relationship with Batman into a more tenser one is also highlighted in the show, with the two-parter episode "Robin's Reckoning" and the episode "Night of the Ninja" examining this. This would eventually come to a head as depicted in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' episode "Old Wounds", where Dick abandons the Robin persona in response to Batman's growing coldness and leaves Gotham.

=== Barbara Gordon / Batgirl ===
Barbara Gordon is first seen in the two-parter "Heart of Steel", where she becomes convinced that her father is an impostor.  She makes her first appearance as her alter ego Batgirl in "Shadow of the Bat", after her father Commissioner Gordon is arrested under charges of corruption. Her Batgirl costume is exactly the same from ''The Adventures of Batman'' and the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books|Bronze Age of Comics]], sporting the same gray bodysuit, blue cape and cowl and yellow bat-symbol and utility belt, but with blue gloves and boots to mirror that of Batman's costume instead of yellow ones (except in the first part of "Shadow of the Bat", where she sported a black cape, cowl, gloves, boots and undergarment similar to the ones in Batman's costume). She makes several appearances throughout the series, and attends the same university as Dick Grayson, though neither of them is aware of each other's crimefighting alter ego. In "Batgirl Returns", Barbara actually makes a cease fire deal with Catwoman, and they work together in solving the case of missing valuable cat statues while Batman is away.  All of Barbara's/Batgirl's appearances are in episodes written by [[Brynne Stephens]].

=== The Joker ===
[[Image:BTASVillains.jpg|thumb|350px|Batman's [[List of Batman Family enemies|rogues gallery]] from left to right: [[Mr. Freeze]], [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]], the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]], the [[Joker (character)|Joker]], [[Harley Quinn]], the [[Mad Hatter (DC Comics)|Mad Hatter]], the [[Riddler]], [[Catwoman]] (with her cat Isis), and [[Two-Face]]]]
Though the Joker's origin is never shown in the series (one of only two villains in the series who never got an origin episode, the other one being [[Penguin (character)|The Penguin]]), some of his past is seen in the feature film ''[[Batman: Mask of the Phantasm]]''. In flashbacks, he is shown before his accident but does not speak or is referred to by name. His potential real name, '''Jack Napier''' (the same name of [[Jack Nicholson]]'s [[Joker (Jack Napier)|version of the character]] from [[Tim Burton]]'s [[Batman (1989 film)|1989 film]]), is established in the episodes "Dreams in Darkness" when it is spoken by Dr. Bartholomew and in "Joker's Wild" where it is written in a dossier. The use of this origin was due to the show being heavily patterned after the success and influential tone of Tim Burton's film. However, when ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' began, during the era of [[Joel Schumacher]]'s films, Joker's origin was retained but his identity was retconned as being merely one of many aliases as seen in the episode "Beware the Creeper", meaning his true identity is still unknown. This reflected the efforts of the writers to put the character back in line with his conflicting multiple origins from the comics.

In ''Mask of the Phantasm'', the man who would become the Joker started out as a chauffeur and hitman for mobsters Salvatore Valestra, Buzz Bronski and Chuckie Sol. On two occasions, he saw Bruce Wayne and the two exchanged glances years before they would clash as the Joker and Batman later. It is hinted in the rest of the series, presumably after the Valestra Mob had gone their separate ways, the man struck out on his own and formed a small gang. The man broke into the ACE Chemical Plant that marked the first time he encountered Batman, a fight which ended with him falling off a catwalk and into a drainage vat of chemicals. He was washed out into the bay and discovered the chemicals bleached his skin chalk white, dyed his hair green, stained his lips red, leaving them in a permanent rictus smile, and dyed his suit purple. This new, clown-like appearance snapped his already sadistic mind and drove him to eternal insanity. He reinvented himself as the Joker, Batman's greatest enemy and Gotham City's most dangerous costumed criminal.

While the use of this origin was based on the Jack Nicholson version, [[Mark Hamill]] was given the note "Don't do Nicholson" before his audition.<ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/dZLpDvQ6vFI Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20200617011200/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZLpDvQ6vFI Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZLpDvQ6vFI|title=Batman The Animated Series &#124; The Heart of Batman Documentary Livestream &#124; Warner Bros. Entertainment|via=www.youtube.com}}{{cbignore}}</ref> During production, Hamill asked the production team (consisting of Timm, Radomski, and Romano) if he could play one of the villains after a small appearance as Ferris Boyle in “[[Heart of Ice (Batman: The Animated Series)|Heart of Ice]]”. Even though [[Tim Curry]] had already recorded a few episodes, Hamill was given the part after Curry developed bronchitis and departed the series. Hamill, who found himself to be the biggest fan of the Batman comics among the cast, credited the laughs he had honed on stage in ''[[Amadeus (play)|Amadeus]]'' with landing him the role.<ref name="HR25"/> He worked to craft a multifaceted laugh for the Joker that could change to reflect the Joker's current mood, likening it to a musical instrument.<ref name="auto">[Batman: The Animated Series: The Legacy Continues, Voices of the Knight, Arkham's Files The Joker]</ref> When recording his lines with the other actors, Hamill would stand while the other actors would remain seated to invest himself in the role. Hamill's take on the Joker's laugh (and the role in general) is considered to be groundbreaking for the voice-acting industry, and led to Hamill having an enormously successful voice-acting career.<ref name="auto"/> Of the many influences for his performance, including [[Jay Leno]] and [[Howard Cosell]], Hamill cited [[Claude Rains]]' performance in the 1933 film ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Many, many influences, but it started with the brilliant Claude Rains as The Invisible Man-always a favorite of mine|url=https://mobile.twitter.com/hamillhimself/status/655463730688331776|access-date=May 21, 2021|website=Twitter|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/mark-hamill-channeled-the-invisible-man-and-jay-leno-as-inspiration-for-the-joker|title=Mark Hamill channeled the Invisible Man and Jay Leno as inspiration for The Joker|first=Josh|last=Grossberg|date=March 29, 2018|website=SYFY WIRE}}</ref>

===Animation===
In order to complete the first season's 65 episodes, [[Warner Bros. Animation]] outsourced the series to several different overseas animation houses: [[Spectrum Animation]], [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]], Studio Junio and [[TMS Entertainment|Tokyo Movie Shinsha]] in Japan, [[Dong Yang Animation]], [[CNK International|Koko Enterprises Ltd.]] and [[AKOM]] in South Korea, [[TVB|Jade Animation]] in Hong Kong, Blue Pencil in Spain and Network of Animation (NOA) in Canada.<ref name="BTASFilmography">[http://anbat.toonzone.net/btas/filmography.html/ ''Batman: The Animated Series'' – Filmography] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105073924/http://anbat.toonzone.net/btas/filmography.html/ |date=November 5, 2014 }}</ref> TMS also animated the first season's opening theme sequence. AKOM was eventually fired due to its inconsistent animation in many episodes such as "Cat Scratch Fever" and "Moon of the Wolf".<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Kindred |first=Christopher |date=June 1993 |title=Batman: The Animated Series – Cat Scratch Fever |url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/batman/btas/backstage/animato/ |magazine=Animato! |publisher=Ventrella |access-date=February 4, 2018}}</ref>

The 20 episodes of the second season were animated largely by Dong Yang, with the exception of three done by Studio Junio ("A Bullet for Bullock", "Avatar" and "Baby-Doll") and one done by Jade Animation ("The Terrible Trio").<ref name="BTASFilmography" />

On the commentary track for "[[Heart of Ice (Batman: The Animated Series episode)|Heart of Ice]]" on the ''Batman: The Animated Series, Volume One'' [[DVD-Video|DVD]], producer Bruce Timm stated that Spectrum was responsible for airbrushing Mr. Freeze's helmet in every frame that featured him. Such attention to detail ultimately drove the studio to bankruptcy; most of their staff members are now working for [[Production I.G]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SpectrumAnimation |title=Spectrum Animation (Creator) – TV Tropes |publisher=TV Tropes |date=October 25, 2012 |access-date=May 2, 2015}}</ref>

===Adaptations===
The show also featured numerous adaptations of various Batman comics stories. The following episodes were adaptations:

* The episode "Appointment in Crime Alley" is based on "There Is No Hope in Crime Alley" from ''Detective Comics'' #457 (March 1976) by writer [[Denny O'Neil]] and artist [[Dick Giordano]].
* "Dreams in Darkness" is loosely based on "[[Batman: The Last Arkham]]" from ''[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat]]'' #1–4 by writer [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] and artist [[Norm Breyfogle]] (June–September 1992). This episode adapted the comic book story with the inclusion of the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] instead of [[Victor Zsasz]] and Dr. Bartholomew instead of [[Jeremiah Arkham]].
* "The Cape and Cowl Conspiracy" was an adaptation of "The Cape and Cowl Death Trap!" from ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #450 (August 1975), written by [[Elliot S. Maggin]] and drawn by artist [[Walt Simonson]].
* Part 1 of "[[Robin's Reckoning]]" takes its cues from "Batman and "Robin the Boy Wonder"" in ''Detective Comics'' #38 (April 1940) by writer [[Bill Finger]], artist [[Bob Kane]] and illustrator [[Jerry Robinson]].
* The episode "The Laughing Fish" was based on three Batman comics, blended together; "The Joker's Five-Way Revenge" from ''Batman'' No. 251 (September 1973) by [[Denny O'Neil]] with art by [[Neal Adams]], followed by "The Laughing Fish" and "Sign of the Joker!" from ''Detective Comics'' #475–476 (February–March 1978), both by writer [[Steve Englehart]] with art by [[Marshall Rogers]]. During a spotlight podcast from [[San Diego Comic-Con|Comic-Con]] 2007, [[Paul Dini]] explained that the reason why the episode combined those stories was that the show's creators could not adapt them separately, because their content and thematic elements would not have been cleared by the censors.
* "The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne" was based on the comic stories "The Dead Yet Live" and "I Am the Batman!" from ''Detective Comics'' #471–472 (August–September 1977) by [[Steve Englehart]].
* "Moon of the Wolf" is based on the comic story of the same name by writer [[Len Wein]] with art by [[Neal Adams]], from ''Batman'' No. 255 (April 1974).
* The episode "Terror in the Sky" is loosely based on "Man-Bat Over Vegas", originally presented in ''Detective Comics'' No. 429, by writer and artist [[Frank Robbins]]. The setting has been shifted from [[Las Vegas]] to Gotham Harbor, and in keeping with the family-friendly rating of the television show, the She-Bat is not a vampire in the adaptation. The final line of the episode, "the nightmare's finally over", is similar to one of the final lines from the original comic, "Now Fran's vampire nightmare is about over".
* The episode "Almost Got 'Im" appears to be influenced by a four-issue story arc in ''Batman'' #291–294 (1977), entitled "Where Were You on the Night Batman Was Killed?".  All four stories were written by [[David Vern Reed]] and drawn by [[John Calnan]] under the direction of Batman editor [[Julius Schwartz]]. In each of the four issues, one of Catwoman, the Riddler, and the Joker all recount their claims to have killed Batman. However, the plot for "Almost Got 'Im" is quite different (six stories in the show, and four completely different ones in the comic book), with only the Joker as an overlapping antagonist.
** Two-Face's strategy in "Almost Got 'Im" (strapping down Batman to a giant coin and flipping the coin in the air) was taken from the comic ''World's Finest Comics'' No. 30 (September 1947) by writer [[Bill Finger]] and artist [[Bob Kane]]. In a backup tale, both Batman and Robin were tied to a giant penny that was catapulted onto spikes by a lesser-known villain, the [[Penny Plunderer]].
* "Off Balance" is a direct adaptation of "Batman: Into the Den of the Death-Dealers" from ''Detective Comics'' #411 (May 1971), written by writer [[Dennis O'Neil]] and drawn by artists Bob Brown and [[Dick Giordano]]. Famous for the first appearance of the mysterious character [[Talia al Ghul|Talia]].
* The two-part episode "The Demon's Quest" is a direct adaptation of "Daughter of the Demon" from ''Batman'' No. 232 (June 1971) and "The Demon Lives Again" ''Batman'' No. 244 (September 1972), written by [[Dennis O'Neil]] and drawn by artist [[Neal Adams]]. Famous for introducing one of Batman's deadlier foes; [[Ra's al Ghul]], the father of Talia.
* The episode "Sideshow" is loosely based on "A Vow from the Grave" from ''Detective Comics'' No. 410 by writer [[Dennis O'Neil]] and artists Bob Brown and [[Dick Giordano]]. This episode adapted the comic book story with the inclusion of a separate [[Killer Croc]] story.
* "A Bullet for Bullock" is based on the comic of the same name from ''Detective Comics'' No. 651 (October 1992), by writer [[Chuck Dixon]] and artist [[Graham Nolan]].
* The feature film ''[[Batman: Mask of the Phantasm|Mask of the Phantasm]]'' is also an adaptation. The film's flashbacks were inspired by "[[Batman: Year One]]", whereas the character of [[Andrea Beaumont]] and the storyline itself were modified from Mike Barr's story "[[Batman: Year Two]]", which ran in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #575–578 in the late 1980s; the villain in the comics was named the [[Reaper (DC Comics)|Reaper]].<ref name="HBO">HBO.

===In other media===
Sixteen minutes of animated segments in the video game ''[[The Adventures of Batman & Robin (video game)|The Adventures of Batman & Robin]]'' for the [[Sega CD]] are sometimes referred to as a "lost episode" of the series. These segments are intended to be interspersed between gameplay elements of an early-1990s video game and as such, the sound, color and story are not quite of the same quality of the actual television program. And because Sega did not have to follow the censorship rules of the show, the fights are also a little more violent. Many of the shows voice actors reprised their roles for the game, and are thus in the lost episode as well. Similar cutscenes appear throughout the video games ''[[Batman: Vengeance]]'' and ''[[Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toonamiarsenal.com/features/lostbatman/ |title=Batman: The Lost "Episode" |publisher=Toonamiarsenal.com |access-date=January 2, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722000700/http://www.toonamiarsenal.com/features/lostbatman/ |archive-date=July 22, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Comic adaptation and novelization==
===The Batman Adventures===
{{main|The Batman Adventures}}
''The Animated Series'' was accompanied by a tie-in comic book, ''The Batman Adventures'', which followed the art style and [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] of ''The Animated Series'' instead of other Batman comic books. ''The Batman Adventures'', through several format changes to reflect the changing world of the series and its spin-offs, outlasted the series itself by nearly a decade, finally being cancelled in 2004 to make way for the tie-in comic of the then-new, unrelated Batman animated series; ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''. The character of Harley Quinn's first official comic appearance occurred in issue No. 12 of the series. It has become highly sought after by collectors and fans of the character.

===Superman & Batman Magazine===
It is a tie-in for ''Batman: The Animated Series'' and ''The Batman Adventures'', with 8 issues published between 1993 and 1995. The stories feature the appearances of Superman and other DC characters before their appearances in the base series and spinoff television series, but otherwise unrelated to the stories in the subsequent television series.

===Batman: The Adventures Continue===
{{main|Batman: The Adventures Continue}}
DC announced in February 2020 that Paul Dini, Alan Burnett and artist Ty Templeton would be leading a new miniseries, ''[[Batman: The Adventures Continue]]'', to be first published in April 2020, based on the animated series and following shortly after its conclusion, with Tim Drake still adjusting as the new Robin to Batman.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/comics/2020/2/13/21136687/batman-animated-series-comic-paul-dini-dc-comics-jason-todd | title = Batman: The Animated Series creator will continue the show — in comics | first= Austen | last=  Goslin | date=  February 13, 2020 | access-date = February 13, 2020 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref>

===Novels===
There was also a short-lived series of tie-in novels, adapted from episodes of the series by science fiction author [[Geary Gravel]]. To achieve novel-length, Gravel combined several related episodes into a single storyline in each novel. The novels included:
* ''Shadows of the Past'' ("Appointment in Crime Alley", "Robin's Reckoning" two-parter)
* ''Dual to the Death'' ("Two-Face" two-parter, "Shadow of the Bat" two-parter)
* ''The Dragon and the Bat'' ("Night of the Ninja", "Day of the Samurai")
* ''Mask of the Phantasm'' (''[[Batman: Mask of the Phantasm]]'')

==Broadcasting==
{{redirect|The Adventures of Batman & Robin|the video game|The Adventures of Batman & Robin (video game)}}
''Batman: The Animated Series'' premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]'s children's block [[Fox Kids]] on September 5, 1992, and aired in that block during weekday afternoons at 4:30&nbsp;pm. In December, just three months after its debut, Fox also began airing episodes of the series on [[prime time|prime-time]] Sunday evenings (followed by the live-action sitcom ''[[Shaky Ground]]''); however, the TV ratings fell short (as the show aired opposite the perennial favorite ''[[60 Minutes]]''), and the series was removed from this time slot in March 1993.

After the series produced its 65th episode (the minimum number necessary for a TV series to be successfully [[television syndication|syndicated]]), Fox Network executives ordered a second season of 20 more episodes that was later reduced to airing weekly on Saturday mornings. The second season featured [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] more prominently and, as a result, was retitled ''The Adventures of Batman & Robin'' in the title credits;<ref>{{cite news|title= ''Batman: The Animated Series'' – Volume 4|work= DVD Talk|url= https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/19231/batman-the-animated-series-volume-4/|access-date=August 16, 2010}}</ref> this run of episodes had two new opening sequences and ending credits. In total, the series reached 85 episodes before finishing its original run on September 15, 1995.

In 1997, following the end of Fox Kids' five-year exclusive broadcast contract, the series began airing in reruns on [[The WB Television Network|The WB Network]]'s children's block [[Kids' WB]]. Later that year, ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' premiered on Kids' WB, airing alongside ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' as part of an hour-long program titled ''[[The New Batman/Superman Adventures]]''.

[[Cartoon Network]] aired reruns of ''Batman: The Animated Series'' from March 2, 1998, to August 18, 2004. On July 3, 2000, the series was added to Cartoon Network's [[Toonami]] line-up. In 2005, reruns of the series were aired on Cartoon Network's sister channel [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]].

The series later began airing on [[Toon Disney]]'s [[Jetix]] line-up on September 30, 2007, again alongside ''Superman: The Animated Series''  (despite Warner Bros. being one of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s biggest competitors).

The show aired on [[Teletoon Retro]] (a Canadian broadcasting channel), debuting on January 8, 2010. The first 65 episodes were confirmed, with the first being "The Cat and Claw, Part 1". The show was scheduled to air on a weekly basis, airing at 7:00&nbsp;am, 6:00&nbsp;pm, and midnight.

[[Discovery Family|The Hub]] started broadcasting the series on September 6, 2011. The channel aired a 10-episode marathon of the series on July 20, 2012, to coincide with the theatrical release of ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' and even created an animated version of one of the film's trailers, featuring [[Kevin Conroy]] and [[Adrienne Barbeau]] re-dubbing Batman and [[Catwoman]]'s dialogue from the trailer.<ref name="BTAS/TDKR trailer">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btMtwz4P0fc BTAS/TDKR trailer on The Hub], Web Video.</ref>

===Influence===
Due to the success of ''Batman: The Animated Series'', many crew members went on to design and produce ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' for The WB Network. During this time they created ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', which featured the same streamlined animation style as ''Superman: The Animated Series'', as well as numerous character re-designs from the original series despite taking place in the same continuity.<ref name="WizReturns">{{cite news |last=Allstetter |first=Rob |date=August 1997 |title=The Dark Knight Returns |work=Wizard |issue=72 |pages=50–54}}</ref>

In 1999, a futuristic spin-off series titled ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' premiered on The WB, featuring a teenager named [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis]] taking on the duties of Batman under the guidance of an elderly Bruce Wayne.<ref name="Batman Beyond" /> Then in 2001, the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series premiered on Cartoon Network, featuring Batman as one of the founding members of the [[Justice League|League]]. This was continued in 2004 by ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', featuring a greatly expanded League. Many DC cartoons unrelated to the larger DC animated universe, such as ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' and ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', also featured character designs strongly influenced by those of [[Bruce Timm]].

The dramatic writing and stylized art of ''Batman: The Animated Series'' separates it from many traditional comic book-based cartoons. It can be considered the dramatic equivalent of more adult-oriented cartoon shows like ''[[The Simpsons]]''. For this reason the show's popularity (along with that of its various spin-offs) endures among older audiences and comic book fans.

The [[Lego]] [[Lego minifigure|minifigures]] of various Batman characters are more strongly based on the designs from ''Batman: The Animated Series'' than any other form of Batman media.<ref name="lego">[http://batman.lego.com/en-US/story/default.aspx Lego] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826063822/http://batman.lego.com/en-US/story/default.aspx |date=August 26, 2010 }}, Batman Story.</ref> More precisely, the [[Joker (character)|Joker]], [[Two-Face]], [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]], [[Mr. Freeze]] and [[Harley Quinn]]'s minifigures seem to have identical costumes and faces to the characters from the series.

The dark atmosphere, mature themes, and even some of the voice cast from the series are employed in the ''[[Batman: Arkham]]'' video game series.<ref name="xbox">[http://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/b/batmanarkhamasylum/ Batman: Arkham Asylum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100721035044/http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/b/batmanarkhamasylum/ |date=July 21, 2010 }}, game overview.</ref> [[Kevin Conroy]], [[Mark Hamill]], [[Arleen Sorkin]], [[Robert Costanzo]] reprising their roles, while actors like [[Adrienne Barbeau]] and [[Loren Lester]] lent their voice to other characters. Furthermore, the first two games are co-written by series veteran [[Paul Dini]]. Also, Batman's design and [[Batsuit#DC animated universe|costume]] in ''The Animated Series'' are featured as an alternate skin in ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]''. These skins are available as [[downloadable content]]; they were also available in pre-orders at [[GameStop]] and a valid membership to Power-Up Rewards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamestop.com/collection/batman-arkham-city |title=Pre Order Batman Arkham City |publisher=GameStop |access-date=October 8, 2011}}</ref> There are also ''Animated''-inspired alternate skins for [[Catwoman]], [[Nightwing]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]].

Actor [[Robert Pattinson]], who portrays Batman in ''[[The Batman (film)|The Batman]]'' (2022), has cited ''Batman: Mask of the Phantasm'' as an example of Batman media that effectively captured the character's psyche in a fashion he hoped his interpretation would emulate.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Whereas in the cinema, it is always his heroic side that is put forward.

''Batman: The Animated Series'' featured a strong musical score written by several different composers throughout the course of the series. The main theme of the show, which was heard during the opening and ending credits of each episode, was composed by [[Danny Elfman]]. At first, Elfman turned down Bruce Timm's offer to compose the theme for the show and so Timm hired [[Shirley Walker]] to do so. However, Elfman later changed his mind and composed a variation of his [[Batman (1989 film)|1989 ''Batman'' film]] theme for the series. Walker's unused theme went on to become the main theme for the second season of the show, when the name was changed to ''The Adventures of Batman & Robin''.<ref>[http://btasscores.150m.com/ Batman Scores] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304065932/http://btasscores.150m.com/ |date=March 4, 2016 }}, history behind the music.</ref>

In 1996, Walker won her first [[Daytime Emmy Award]] for her music direction of the episode "A Bullet for Bullock" (scored by Harvey R. Cohen). She would then go on to win another Daytime Emmy Award in the category of music-composition for ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' in 2001.<ref name="Variety">{{cite magazine |first=Jon|last=Burlingame|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117955064.html?categoryid=1237&cs=1|title=Composer Walker dies|access-date=September 12, 2008 |magazine=Variety|date=December 4, 2006}}</ref>

Although at least twenty-four different composers worked on the series,<ref name="B:TAS scores">{{cite web|url=http://www.btasscores.150m.com/|title=THE SCORES OF: "Batman: The Animated Series"|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304065932/http://www.btasscores.150m.com/|archive-date=March 4, 2016}}</ref> Walker, [[Lolita Ritmanis]], and Michael McCuistion are regarded as the main contributors. After the series finished up in 1995, the three then went on to score ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' (which also featured a theme by Walker) in 1996, ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' in 1997 and ''Batman Beyond'' in 1999. Television composer [[Kristopher Carter]] scored alongside Walker, Ritmanis, and McCuistion throughout the many [[DC animated universe|DCAU]] series and later filled in for Walker after her death in 2006.

===Soundtracks===

On December 16, 2008, La La Land Records announced the release of a soundtrack companion to ''Batman: The Animated Series'' on a two-disc CD set, which featured 11 episode scores (including those of "On Leather Wings", the "Two-Face" two-parter, "Joker's Favor" and "Perchance to Dream"). The release was limited to a pressing of 3,000 copies, which sold quickly.<ref name="wfo">[http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/2008/11/la-la-land-records-to-release-soundtrack-collecting-batman-the-animated-series-score/ The World's Finest Online], soundtrack release.</ref> About one month after its release, the soundtrack set had sold over 2,500 copies. According to a spokesperson of La La Land Records, the sold out status of the soundtrack "can only help as the label hopes to convince Warner Bros. to release more ''Batman: The Animated Series'' soundtracks."<ref name="spill">{{cite web|title=Batman: The Animated Series Soundtrack Release A Success, Sells Over 2500 Copies|url=http://my.spill.com/group/comicbooksandcomicmovierulemylife/forum/topics/batman-the-animated-series|website=Spill.com|access-date=June 28, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918025716/http://my.spill.com/group/comicbooksandcomicmovierulemylife/forum/topics/batman-the-animated-series|archive-date=September 18, 2012|date=January 20, 2009}}</ref> The soundtrack received largely positive reviews.<ref name="mof">[https://web.archive.org/web/20101128043046/http://musiconfilm.net/2009/02/batman-the-animated-series/ Music on Film], soundtrack review.</ref><ref name="ttblog">[http://tomztoyz.blogspot.com/2008/12/review-batmanthe-animated-series.html Tomz Toyz – Blogspot], soundtrack review.</ref>

==Video games==
Several video games based on the animated continuity were released during the [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|16-bit game-machine era]], using ''[[The Adventures of Batman & Robin (video game)|The Adventures of Batman & Robin]]'' second season branding. [[Konami]] developed a game for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES), while [[Sega]] released versions of the game for the [[Sega Genesis|Sega Genesis/Mega Drive]], [[Sega Mega-CD|Mega-CD]] and [[Sega Game Gear|Game Gear]]. The SNES, Genesis/Mega Drive and Game Gear versions were side-scrolling action games, while the Mega-CD version featured a 3-D driving adventure. All of the games had art true to the series, while Sega's versions featured art elements directly from the show's creators.<ref name="ign">[http://cheats.ign.com/objects/005/005947.html IGN] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008065236/http://cheats.ign.com/objects/005/005947.html |date=October 8, 2009 }}, ''The Adventures of Batman & Robin'' – Sega CD.</ref> The CD version has over 20 minutes of original animated footage comparable to the most well-crafted episodes,<ref name="mobygames">[http://www.mobygames.com/game/adventures-of-batman-robin Moby Games], ''The Adventures of Batman & Robin'' video game description.</ref> with the principal voice actors reprising their roles.

There was also a game made for the [[Game Boy]] based on the series and created around the same time. Developed and published by Konami, this game was distinctive upon the fact that it still used the earlier ''[[Batman: The Animated Series (video game)|Batman: The Animated Series]]'' moniker instead of ''The Adventures of Batman & Robin'' second season title given to the other games.

Though not directly related, the ''[[Batman: Arkham]]'' video game series features some of the voice cast from ''The Animated Series'' returning to their roles, including Kevin Conroy as Batman and Mark Hamill as the Joker, along with [[Arleen Sorkin]] as Harley Quinn in ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'' and [[Robert Costanzo]] as [[Harvey Bullock (character)|Harvey Bullock]] in ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'', while actors like [[Loren Lester]] lent their voice to other characters. Additionally, the first two games were written by ''Animated Series'' writer [[Paul Dini]]. Many of the characters' costumes from the series also appear as downloadable skins in the games.

In ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]'', a [[downloadable content]] level was released, based on the ''[[Batman: Mask of the Phantasm]]'' film, and contained some characters from the show, including the ''Batman: The Animated Series'' version of Batman, [[The Joker]], [[Harley Quinn]], [[Two-Face]], [[Andrea Beaumont]] as The Phantasm, [[Mad Hatter (DC Comics)|Mad Hatter]], [[Man-Bat]], and Captain Clown.

== Cancelled spin-off ==
Due to the success of the show, Fox approached [[Bruce Timm]] to make a spin-off centered on [[Catwoman]], but the project was abandoned shortly thereafter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/sections/backstage/abandoned/|title=The World's Finest – The DC Animation Resource|website=www.worldsfinestonline.com}}</ref>

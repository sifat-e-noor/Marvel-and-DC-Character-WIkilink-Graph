'''The Joker''' is a <!-- Do not add "fictional" as it is tautological; supervillains (and characters in general) are by definition implied to be fictionalized to some extent.-->[[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. The character was created by [[Bill Finger]], [[Bob Kane]], and [[Jerry Robinson]], and first appeared in the debut issue of the comic book ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' on April 25, 1940. Credit for the Joker's creation is disputed; Kane and Robinson claimed responsibility for the Joker's design while acknowledging Finger's writing contribution. Although the Joker was planned to be killed off during his initial appearance, he was spared by editorial intervention, allowing the character to endure as the [[archenemy]] of the [[superhero]] [[Batman]].

In his comic book appearances, the Joker is portrayed as a criminal mastermind. Introduced as a [[Psychopathy|psychopath]] with a warped, [[sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] sense of humor, the character became a goofy prankster in the late 1950s in response to regulation by the [[Comics Code Authority]], before returning to his darker roots during the early 1970s. As Batman's nemesis, the Joker has been part of the superhero's defining stories, including the murder of [[Jason Todd]]—the second [[Robin (character)|Robin]] and Batman's ward—and the paralysis of one of Batman's allies, [[Barbara Gordon]]. The Joker has had various possible origin stories during his decades of appearances. The most common story involves him falling into a tank of chemical waste that bleaches his skin white and turns his hair green and lips bright red; the resulting disfigurement drives him insane. The antithesis of Batman in personality and appearance, the Joker is considered by critics to be his perfect adversary.

The Joker possesses no superhuman abilities, instead using his expertise in chemical engineering to develop poisonous or lethal concoctions and thematic weaponry, including razor-tipped [[playing card]]s, deadly [[joy buzzer]]s, and acid-spraying lapel flowers. The Joker sometimes works with other [[Gotham City]] supervillains, such as the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]] and [[Two-Face]], and groups like the Injustice Gang and Injustice League, but these relationships often collapse due to the Joker's desire for unbridled chaos. The 1990s introduced a romantic interest for the Joker in his former psychiatrist, [[Harley Quinn]], who became his criminal sidekick and girlfriend before finally escaping their [[abusive relationship]]. Although his primary obsession is Batman, the Joker has also fought other heroes, including [[Superman]] and [[Wonder Woman]].

One of the most iconic characters in popular culture, the Joker has been listed among the greatest comic book villains and fictional characters ever created. The character's popularity has seen him appear on a variety of merchandise, such as clothing and collectible items, inspire real-world structures (such as theme park attractions), and be referenced in a number of media. The Joker has been adapted in live-action, animated, and video game incarnations, including <!-- DO NOT ADD ANY OTHER ACTORS HERE UNLESS INDEPENDENTLY NOTABLE, IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO LIST ANYONE WHO EVER PORTRAYED THE JOKER EVER-->the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]''<!-- DO NOT ADD ANY OTHER ACTORS HERE WITHOUT TALK PAGE DISCUSSION, IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO LIST ANYONE WHO EVER PORTRAYED THE JOKER EVER--> television series played by [[Cesar Romero]] and in films by [[Jack Nicholson]]<!-- DO NOT ADD ANY OTHER ACTORS HERE WITHOUT TALK PAGE DISCUSSION, IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO LIST ANYONE WHO EVER PORTRAYED THE JOKER EVER--> in ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]''<!-- DO NOT ADD ANY OTHER ACTORS HERE UNLESS INDEPENDENTLY NOTABLE, IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO LIST ANYONE WHO EVER PORTRAYED THE JOKER EVER--> (1989), [[Heath Ledger]]<!-- DO NOT ADD ANY OTHER ACTORS HERE WITHOUT TALK PAGE DISCUSSION, IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO LIST ANYONE WHO EVER PORTRAYED THE JOKER EVER--> in ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' (2008), [[Jared Leto]] in the [[DC Extended Universe]] (2016–present), and [[Joaquin Phoenix]] in ''[[Joker (2019 film)|Joker]]'' (2019–present); Ledger and Phoenix each earned an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for their portrayals.<!-- DO NOT ADD ANY OTHER ACTORS HERE UNLESS INDEPENDENTLY NOTABLE, IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO LIST ANYONE WHO EVER PORTRAYED THE JOKER EVER--> [[Mark Hamill]] and others<!-- DO NOT ADD ANY OTHER ACTORS HERE UNLESS INDEPENDENTLY NOTABLE, IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO LIST ANYONE WHO EVER PORTRAYED THE JOKER EVER--> have provided the character's voice in media ranging from animation to video games.<!-- DO NOT ADD ANY OTHER ACTORS HERE WITHOUT TALK PAGE DISCUSSION, IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO LIST ANYONE WHO EVER PORTRAYED THE JOKER EVER-->

[[Bill Finger]], [[Bob Kane]], and [[Jerry Robinson]] are credited with creating the Joker, but their accounts of the character's conception differ, each providing his own version of events. Finger's, Kane's, and Robinson's versions acknowledge that Finger produced an image of actor [[Conrad Veidt]] in character as Gwynplaine (a man whose mouth is disfigured into a perpetual grin) in the 1928 film ''[[The Man Who Laughs (1928 film)|The Man Who Laughs]]'' as an inspiration for the Joker's appearance, and Robinson produced a sketch of a [[Joker (playing card)|joker playing card]].<ref name="ImpactCBR"/><ref name="Creation1"/>

Robinson stated that it was his 1940 card sketch that served as the character's concept, and Finger associated that image with Veidt in the film.<ref name="ImpactCBR"/> Kane hired the 17-year-old Robinson as an assistant in 1939, after he saw Robinson in a white jacket decorated with his own illustrations.<ref name="Creation4"/> Beginning as a [[letterer]] and background inker, Robinson quickly became primary artist for the newly created ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' comic book series. In a 1975 interview in ''[[The Amazing World of DC Comics]]'', Robinson said he wanted a supreme arch-villain who could test Batman, not a typical crime lord or gangster designed to be easily disposed of. He wanted an exotic, enduring character as an ongoing source of conflict for Batman (similar to the relationship between [[Sherlock Holmes]] and [[Professor Moriarty]]), designing a diabolically sinister, but clownish, villain.<ref name="Creation5"/><ref name="Origin3"/>{{sfn|Tollin|1975|pp=2–3}} Robinson was intrigued by villains; he believed that some characters are made up of contradictions, leading to the Joker's sense of humor. He said that the name came first, followed by an image of a playing card from a deck he often had at hand: "I wanted somebody visually exciting. I wanted somebody that would make an indelible impression, would be bizarre, would be memorable like the [[Hunchback of Notre Dame]] or any other villains that had unique physical characters."<ref name="Creation8"/> He told Finger about his concept by telephone, later providing sketches of the character and images of what would become his iconic Joker playing-card design. Finger thought the concept was incomplete, providing the image of Veidt with a ghastly, permanent [[Risus sardonicus|rictus grin]].<ref name="Creation5"/>

Kane countered that Robinson's sketch was produced only after Finger had already shown the Gwynplaine image to Kane, and that it was only used as a card design belonging to the Joker in his early appearances.<ref name="Creation1"/> Finger said that he was also inspired by the [[Steeplechase Face]], an image in [[Steeplechase Park]] at [[Coney Island]] that resembled a Joker's head, which he sketched and later shared with future editorial director [[Carmine Infantino]].<ref name="Creation2"/> In a 1994 interview with journalist [[Frank Lovece]], Kane stated his position:

{{blockquote|Bill Finger and I created the Joker. Bill was the writer. Jerry Robinson came to me with a playing card of the Joker. That's the way I sum it up. [The Joker] looks like Conrad Veidt&nbsp;– you know, the actor in ''The Man Who Laughs'', [the 1928 movie based on the novel] by [[Victor Hugo]].&nbsp;... Bill Finger had a book with a photograph of Conrad Veidt and showed it to me and said, 'Here's the Joker.' Jerry Robinson had absolutely nothing to do with it, but he'll always say he created it till he dies. He brought in a playing card, which we used for a couple of issues for him [the Joker] to use as his playing card.<ref name="Creation101"/><ref name="KaneLovece"/>|sign=|source=}}

Robinson credited himself, Finger, and Kane for the Joker's creation. He said he created the character as Batman's larger-than-life nemesis when extra stories were quickly needed for ''Batman'' #1, and he received credit for the story in a college course:<ref name="Creation102"/>

{{blockquote|In that first meeting when I showed them that sketch of the Joker, Bill said it reminded him of Conrad Veidt in ''The Man Who Laughs''. That was the first mention of it&nbsp;... He can be credited and Bob himself, we all played a role in it. The concept was mine. Bill finished that first script from my outline of the persona and what should happen in the first story. He wrote the script of that, so he really was co-creator, and Bob and I did the visuals, so Bob was also.<ref name="Creation103"/>}}

Finger provided his own account in 1966:
{{blockquote|I got a call from Bob Kane.... He had a new villain. When I arrived he was holding a playing card. Apparently Jerry Robinson or Bob, I don't recall who, looked at the card and they had an idea for a character ... the Joker. Bob made a rough sketch of it. At first it didn't look much like the Joker. It looked more like a clown. But I remembered that Grosset & Dunlap formerly issued very cheap editions of classics by [[Alexandre Dumas]] and Victor Hugo ... The volume I had was ''The Man Who Laughs'' — his face had been permanently operated on so that he will always have this perpetual grin. And it looked absolutely weird. I cut the picture out of the book and gave it to Bob, who drew the profile and gave it a more sinister aspect. Then he worked on the face; made him look a little [[clown]]-like, which accounted for his white face, red lips, green hair. And that was the Joker!<ref name="Batmania 14"/>}}

Although Kane adamantly refused to share credit for many of his characters, and refuted Robinson's claim for the rest of his life, many comic historians credit Robinson with the Joker's creation and Finger with the character's development.<ref name="ImpactCBR"/><ref name="Creation1"/><ref name="Creation4"/><ref name="Creation2"/> By 2011, Finger, Kane, and Robinson had died, leaving the story unresolved.<ref name="Creation5"/><ref name="Creation2"/><ref name="GoldenAge6"/>

===Golden Age===
[[File:Comic Book - The Joker (1940).jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Comic book panel of the grinning Joker|From the Joker's debut in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #1 (April 25, 1940)]]
The Joker debuted in ''Batman'' #1 (April 1940) as the eponymous character's first villain, about a year after Batman's debut in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #27 (May 1939). The Joker initially appeared as a remorseless [[serial killer]] and jewel thief, modeled after a joker playing card with a mirthless grin, who killed his victims with "Joker venom," a toxin that left their faces smiling grotesquely.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=21}} The character was intended to be killed in his second appearance in ''Batman'' #1, after being stabbed in the heart. Finger wanted the Joker to die because of his concern that recurring villains would make Batman appear inept, but was overruled by then-editor [[Whitney Ellsworth]]; a hastily drawn panel, indicating that the Joker was still alive, was added to the comic.<ref name="ImpactCBR"/><ref name="GoldenAge1"/><ref name="GoldenAge3"/> The Joker went on to appear in nine of ''Batman''{{'}}s first 12 issues.<ref name="GoldenAge2"/>

The character's regular appearances quickly defined him as the archenemy of the Dynamic Duo, Batman and [[Robin (character)|Robin]]; he killed dozens of people, and even derailed a train.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fleisher |first1=Michael L. |title=The Encyclopedia of Comic Book Heroes, Volume 1: Batman |date=1976 |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishing]] |location=New York City|isbn=0-02-538700-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofco01flei/page/234/mode/2up |access-date=29 March 2020 |pages=234–250}}</ref> By issue #13, Kane's work on the [[Print syndication|syndicated]] ''Batman'' newspaper strip left him little time for the comic book; artist [[Dick Sprang]] assumed his duties, and editor [[Jack Schiff]] collaborated with Finger on stories. Around the same time, DC Comics found it easier to market its stories to children without the more mature [[Pulp magazine|pulp]] elements that had originated many superhero comics. During this period, the first changes in the Joker began to appear, portraying him as a wacky but harmless prankster; in one story, the Joker kidnaps Robin and Batman pays the ransom by check, meaning that the Joker cannot cash it without being arrested.{{sfn|Manning|2011|pp=24, 27|ps=. <q>Not coincidentally, DC found it easier to market their comics to kids without the salacious overtones of the pulp magazines from which many superhero comics had sprung.</q>}} Comic book writer [[Mark Waid]] suggests that the 1942 story "The Joker Walks the Last Mile" was the beginning point for the character's transformation into a more goofy incarnation, a period that [[Grant Morrison]] considered to have lasted the following 30 years.{{sfn|Weiner|Peaslee|2015|p=36}}

The 1942 cover of ''Detective Comics'' #69, known as "Double Guns" (with the Joker emerging from a [[genie]]'s lamp, aiming two guns at Batman and Robin), is considered one of the greatest superhero comic covers of the Golden Age and is the only image from that era of the character using traditional guns. Robinson said that other contemporary villains used guns, and the creative team wanted the Joker—as Batman's adversary—to be more resourceful.<ref name="DoubleGuns"/><ref name="DoubleGunsDeux"/>

===Silver Age===
The Joker was one of the few popular villains continuing to appear regularly in Batman comics from the Golden Age into the Silver Age, as the series continued during the rise in popularity of mystery and romance comics. In 1951, Finger wrote an [[origin story]] for the Joker in ''Detective Comics'' #168, which introduced the characteristic of him formerly being the criminal [[Red Hood]], and his disfigurement the result of a fall into a chemical vat.<ref name="SilverAge1"/>

By 1954, the [[Comics Code Authority]] had been established in response to increasing public disapproval of comic book content. The backlash was inspired by [[Frederic Wertham]], who hypothesized that mass media (especially comic books) was responsible for the rise in [[juvenile delinquency]], violence and [[homosexuality]], particularly in young males. Parents forbade their children from reading comic books, and there were several mass burnings.<ref name="ImpactCBR"/> The Comics Code banned gore, innuendo and excessive violence, stripping Batman of his menace and transforming the Joker into a goofy, thieving trickster without his original homicidal tendencies.<ref name="GoldenAge1"/>{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=171}}

The character appeared less frequently after 1964, when [[Julius Schwartz]] (who disliked the Joker) became editor of the Batman comics.<ref name="ImpactCBR"/><ref name="GoldenAge1"/><ref name="GoldenAge5"/> The character risked becoming an obscure figure of the preceding era until this goofy prankster version of the character was adapted into the 1966 television series ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', in which he was played by [[Cesar Romero]].<ref name="ImpactCBR"/><ref name="GoldenAge1"/> The show's popularity compelled Schwartz to keep the comics in a similar vein. As the show's popularity waned, however, so did that of the ''Batman'' comics.<ref name="ImpactCBR"/><ref name="GoldenAge5"/> After the TV series ended in 1969, the increase in public visibility had not stopped the comic's sales decline; editorial director [[Carmine Infantino]] resolved to turn things around, moving stories away from child-friendly adventures.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=173|ps=. <q>Because the surge in public visibility hadn't helped stop Batman's comic book slide, editorial director Carmine Infantino vowed to turn things around&nbsp;... and moved even further away from schoolboy-friendly adventures.</q>}} The Silver Age introduced several of the Joker's defining character traits: lethal [[joy buzzer]]s, acid-squirting flowers, trick guns, and goofy, elaborate crimes.<ref name="Personality2"/><ref name="JokerGadgets"/>

===Bronze Age===

In 1973, after a four-year disappearance,<ref name="ImpactCBR"/> the Joker was revived (and revised) by writer [[Dennis O'Neil]] and artist [[Neal Adams]]. Beginning with ''Batman'' #251's "The Joker's Five-Way Revenge", the character returns to his roots as an impulsive, homicidal maniac who matches wits with Batman.<ref name="ImpactCBR2"/><ref name="BronzeAge6"/> This story began a trend in which the Joker was used, sparingly, as a central character.<ref name="BronzeAge10"/> O'Neil said his idea was "simply to take it back to where it started. I went to the DC library and read some of the early stories. I tried to get a sense of what Kane and Finger were after."<ref name="BronzeAge8"/> O'Neil's 1973 run introduced the idea of the Joker being legally insane, to explain why the character is sent to [[Arkham Asylum]] (introduced by O'Neil in 1974 as Arkham Hospital) instead of to prison.<ref name="BronzeAge20"/> Adams modified the Joker's appearance, changing his more average figure by extending his jaw and making him taller and leaner.<ref name="BronzeAge9"/>

DC Comics was a hotbed of experimentation during the 1970s, and in 1975 the character became the first villain to feature as the title character in a comic book series, ''[[The Joker (comic book)|The Joker]]''.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=176}} The series followed the character's interactions with other supervillains, and the first issue was written by O'Neil.<ref name="1975JokerComic"/> Stories balanced between emphasizing the Joker's criminality and making him a likable protagonist whom readers could support. Although he murdered thugs and civilians, he never fought Batman; this made ''The Joker'' a series in which the character's villainy prevailed over rival villains, instead of a struggle between good and evil.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=177}} Because the Comics Code Authority mandated punishment for villains, each issue ended with the Joker being apprehended, limiting the scope of each story. The series never found an audience, and ''The Joker'' was canceled after nine issues (despite a "next issue" advertisement for an appearance by the [[Justice League]]).<ref name="1975JokerComic"/>{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=177}}{{sfn|Duncan Smith|2013|p=380}} The complete series became difficult to obtain over time, often commanding high prices from collectors. In 2013, DC Comics reissued the series as a [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]].{{sfn|Weiner|Peaslee|2015|p=XVI}}

When [[Jenette Kahn]] became DC editor in 1976, she redeveloped the company's struggling titles; during her tenure, the Joker would become one of DC's most popular characters.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=177}} While O'Neil and Adams' work was critically acclaimed, writer [[Steve Englehart]] and [[penciller]] [[Marshall Rogers]]'s eight-issue run in ''Detective Comics'' #471–476 (August 1977–April 1978) defined the Joker for decades to come<ref name="ImpactCBR2"/> with stories emphasizing the character's insanity. In "The Laughing Fish", the Joker disfigures fish with a rictus grin resembling his own (expecting [[copyright]] protection), and is unable to understand that copyrighting a [[natural resource]] is legally impossible.<ref name="BronzeAge6"/><ref name="BronzeAge20"/><ref name="Bio101"/><ref name="BronzeAge7"/> Englehart's and Rogers' work on the series influenced the 1989 film ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', and was adapted for 1992's ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''.<ref name="BronzeAge20"/><ref name="BronzeAge4"/> Rogers expanded on Adams' character design, drawing the Joker with a fedora and trench coat.<ref name="BronzeAge9"/> Englehart outlined how he understood the character by saying that the Joker "was this very crazy, scary character. I really wanted to get back to the idea of Batman fighting insane murderers at 3 a.m. under the full moon, as the clouds scuttled by."<ref name="GoldenAge1"/>

==={{anchor|Modern age}}Modern Age===
Years after the end of the 1966 television series, sales of ''Batman'' continued to fall and the title was nearly cancelled. Although the 1970s restored the Joker as Batman's insane, lethal archenemy, it was during the 1980s that the ''Batman'' series started to turn around and the Joker came into his own as part of the "Dark Age" of comics, with mature tales of death and destruction. The shift was criticized for moving away from tamer superheroes (and villains), but comic audiences were no longer primarily children.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=182}}<ref name="ImpactCBR2"/> Several months after ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' launched the era by killing off Silver Age icons such as the [[Flash (DC Comics character)|Flash]] and [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]] and undoing decades of continuity,<ref>{{harvnb|Manning|2011|p=183}} <q>DC birthed the Dark Age with the twelve-part Crisis on Infinite Earths.

In the 1988–89 story arc "[[Batman: A Death in the Family|A Death in the Family]]", the Joker murders Batman's sidekick (the second Robin, [[Jason Todd]]). Todd was unpopular with fans; rather than modify his character, DC opted to let them vote for his fate and a 72-vote plurality had the Joker beat Todd to death with a crowbar. This story altered the Batman universe: instead of killing anonymous bystanders, the Joker murdered a core character; this had a lasting effect on future stories.<ref name="ModernAge5"/>{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=108}} Written at the height of tensions between the United States and Iran, the story's conclusion had Iranian leader [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini]] appoint the Joker his country's ambassador to the United Nations (allowing him to temporarily escape justice).<ref name="InfoDoG1"/>

[[Alan Moore]] and [[Brian Bolland]]'s 1988 graphic novel ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke|The Killing Joke]]'' expands on the Joker's origins, describing the character as a failed comedian who adopts the identity of the Red Hood to support his pregnant wife.<ref name="SilverAge1"/><ref>Greenberger and Manning, p. 38: "Offering keen insight into both the minds of the Joker and Batman, this special is considered by most Batman fans to be the definitive Joker story of all time."</ref> Unlike ''The Dark Knight Returns'', ''The Killing Joke'' takes place in mainstream continuity.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=188}} The novel is described by critics as one of the greatest Joker stories ever written, influencing later comic stories (including the forced retirement of then-[[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]], Barbara Gordon, after she is paralyzed by the Joker) and films such as 1989's ''Batman'' and 2008's ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]''.<ref name="ModernAge10"/><ref name="ModernAge11"/><ref name="ModernAgeCBR"/> Grant Morrison's 1989 ''[[Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth]]'' explores the psychoses of Batman, the Joker and other rogues in the [[Arkham Asylum|eponymous facility]].<ref name="ModernAge12"/><ref name="ModernAge13"/>

The 1992 animated series introduced the Joker's female sidekick: [[Harley Quinn]], a psychiatrist who falls for—and ends up in an abusive relationship with—the Joker, becoming his [[supervillain]] accomplice. The character was popular, and was adapted into the comics as the Joker's romantic interest in 1999.<ref name="ModernAge15"/> In the same year, [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] and [[Norm Breyfogle]]'s comic book ''[[Anarky (comic book)|Anarky]]'' concluded with the revelation that [[Anarky|the titular character]] was the Joker's son. Breyfogle conceived the idea as a means to expand on Anarky's characterization, but O'Neil (by then the editor for the ''Batman'' series of books) was opposed to it, and only allowed it to be written under protest, and with a promise that the revelation would eventually be revealed incorrect. However, the ''Anarky'' series was cancelled before the rebuttal could be published.<ref name="Anarky"/> The Joker's first major storyline in [[The New 52]], DC Comics' 2011 reboot of story continuity, was 2012's "[[Death of the Family]]" by writer [[Scott Snyder]] and artist [[Greg Capullo]].

=={{anchor|Fictional character biography}}Character biography==
The Joker has undergone many revisions since his 1940 debut. The most common interpretation of the character is that of a man who, while disguised as the criminal Red Hood, is pursued by Batman and falls into a vat of chemicals that bleaches his skin, colors his hair green and his lips red, and drives him insane. The reasons why the Joker was disguised as the Red Hood and his identity before his transformation have changed over time.<ref name="GoldenAge1"/>

The character was introduced in ''Batman'' #1 (1940), in which he announces that he will kill three of Gotham's prominent citizens. Although the police protect his first announced victim, millionaire Henry Claridge, the Joker had poisoned him before making his announcement and Claridge dies with a ghastly grin on his face. Batman eventually defeats him, sending him to prison.<ref name="JokerBioGeek2"/> The Joker commits crimes ranging from whimsical to brutal, for reasons that, in Batman's words, "make sense to him alone".<ref name="Bio101"/> ''Detective Comics'' #168 (1951) introduced the Joker's first origin story as the former [[Red Hood]]: a masked criminal who, during his final heist, vanished after leaping into a vat of chemicals to escape Batman. His resulting disfigurement drove him insane and led him to adopt the name "Joker", from the playing card figure he came to resemble.<ref name="SilverAge1"/> The Joker's [[Silver Age (comics)|Silver Age]] transformation into a figure of fun was established in 1952's "[[Joker's Millions|The Joker's Millions]]".

''Batman: The Killing Joke'' (1988) built on the Joker's 1951 origin story, portraying him as a failed comedian who participates in a robbery as the Red Hood to support his pregnant wife. Batman arrives to stop the robbery, provoking the terrified comedian into jumping into a vat of chemicals, which dyes his skin chalk-white, his hair green, and his lips bright red. His disfigurement, combined with the trauma of his wife's earlier accidental death, drives him insane, and results in the birth of the Joker.<ref name="SilverAge1"/> However, the Joker says that this story may not be true; he admits that he does not remember exactly what drove him insane, and says that he prefers his past to be "multiple choice".<ref name="TKJ"/> In this graphic novel, the Joker shoots and paralyzes [[Barbara Gordon]], the former [[Batgirl]], and tortures her father, [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner James Gordon]], to prove that it only takes "one bad day" to drive a normal man insane.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=188}} After Batman rescues Gordon and subdues the Joker, he offers to rehabilitate his old foe and end their rivalry. Although the Joker refuses, he shows his appreciation by sharing a joke with Batman.<ref name="PersonalityTKJ"/> Following the character's maiming of Barbara, she became a more important character in the DC Universe: the Oracle, a data gatherer and superhero informant, who has her revenge in ''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]'' by shattering the Joker's teeth and destroying his smile.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=188}}

In the 1988 story "A Death in the Family", the Joker beats [[Jason Todd]], the second [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], with a crowbar and leaves him to die in an explosion.

In the 1999 "[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]" storyline, the Joker murders Commissioner Gordon's second wife, [[Sarah Essen Gordon|Sarah]], as she shields a group of infants.<ref name="ComicNoManLand"/> He taunts Gordon, who shoots him in the kneecap. The Joker, lamenting that he may never walk again, collapses with laughter when he realizes that the commissioner has avenged Barbara's paralysis.<ref name="DetectiveComic741"/>

The 2000s began with the [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] story "Emperor Joker", in which the Joker steals [[Mister Mxyzptlk]]'s reality-altering power and remakes the universe in his image (torturing and killing Batman daily, before resurrecting him). When the supervillain then tries to destroy the universe, his reluctance to eliminate Batman makes him lose control, and Superman defeats him.<ref name= "JokerBioGeek3"/> Broken by his experience, Batman's experiences of death are transferred to Superman by the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)#Hal Jordan, Spirit of Redemption|Spectre]] so he can heal mentally.<ref name= "ComicEmperorJoker"/> {{anchor|Last_Laugh}} In ''[[Last Laugh (comics)|Joker: Last Laugh]]'' (2001), the doctors at [[Arkham Asylum]] convince the character that he is dying in an attempt to rehabilitate him.

In "[[Batman: Under the Hood|Under the Hood]]" (2005), a resurrected Todd tries to force Batman to avenge his death by killing the Joker.

{{Quote box|width=27%|align=right|quote= "They've given many origins of the Joker, how he came to be. That doesn't seem to matter—just how he is now.

Although a number of [[Backstory|backstories]] have been given, a definitive one has never been established for the Joker. An [[unreliable narrator]], the character is uncertain of who he was before and how he became the Joker: "Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another&nbsp;...if I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!"<ref name= "Origin3"/><ref name="TKJ"/> A story about the Joker's origin appeared in ''Detective Comics'' #168 (February 1951), more than decade after the character's debut. Here, the character is a laboratory worker who becomes the Red Hood (a masked criminal) to steal $1 million and retire. He falls into a vat of chemical waste when his heist is thwarted by Batman, emerging with bleached white skin, red lips, green hair and a permanent grin.<ref name="Origin1"/><ref name= "Origin2"/>

This story was the basis for the most often-cited origin tale, Moore's [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''The Killing Joke''.<ref name= "ModernAge11"/> The man who will become the Joker quits his job as a lab assistant in order to fulfill his dream of being a stand-up comedian, only to fail miserably. Desperate to support his pregnant wife, he agrees to help two criminals commit a robbery as the Red Hood. The heist goes awry; the comedian leaps into a chemical vat to escape Batman, surfacing disfigured. This, combined with the earlier accidental death of his wife and unborn child, drives the comedian insane, turning him into the Joker.<ref name="SilverAge1"/><ref name="ImpactCBR2"/> This version has been cited in many stories, including ''[[Batman: The Man Who Laughs]]'' (in which Batman deduces that the Red Hood survived his fall and became the Joker), ''Batman'' #450 (in which the Joker dons the Red Hood to aid his recovery after the events in "A Death in the Family", but finds the experience too traumatic), ''[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat]]'' #38 (in which Joker's failed stand-up performance is shown), "Death of the Family",<ref name="Origin2"/> and ''Batman: Three Jokers'' (which asserts that it is the [[canon (fiction)|canon]] origin story).<ref name="IGNThreeJokersEnding"/> Other stories have expanded on this origin; "[[Batman: Gotham Knights|Pushback]]" suggests that the Joker's wife was murdered by a corrupt policeman working for the mobsters,<ref name="OriginPushback"/> and "Payback" gives the Joker's first name as "Jack".<ref name="Origin2"/> The ending of ''Batman: Three Jokers'' establishes that the Joker's wife did not actually die—rather, she fled to Alaska with the help of Gotham police and Batman because she feared her husband would be an abusive father; the police then told the Joker a story about her dying to protect her. The miniseries also reveals that Batman knows the Joker's identity, and has kept it secret in order to protect the criminal's wife and son.<ref name="IGNThreeJokersEnding">{{cite web |last1=Schedeen |first1=Jesse |title=Three Jokers Ending Explained: How the Series Redefines Batman and Joker's Rivalry |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/batman-three-jokers-finale-ending-explained-identity-canon |website=[[IGN]] |access-date=October 28, 2020 |date=October 27, 2020}}</ref>

However, the Joker's unreliable memory has allowed writers to develop other origins for the character.<ref name="Origin2"/> "Case Study", a [[Paul Dini]]-[[Alex Ross]] story, describes the Joker as a sadistic gangster who creates the Red Hood identity because he misses the thrill of committing robberies. He has his fateful first meeting with Batman, which results in his disfigurement. It is suggested that the Joker is sane, and researches his crimes to ''look like'' the work of a sick mind in order to avoid the death penalty. In ''[[Batman Confidential]]'' #7–12, the character, Jack, is a career criminal who is bored with his work. He encounters (and becomes obsessed with) Batman during a heist, embarking on a crime spree to attract the Caped Crusader's attention. After Jack injures Batman's girlfriend, Batman scars Jack's face with a [[Glasgow smile|permanent grin]] and betrays him to a group of mobsters, who torture him in a chemical plant. Jack escapes, but falls into an empty vat as gunfire punctures chemical tanks above him. The flood of chemicals (used in [[anti-psychotic]] medication) alters his appearance and completes his transformation.<ref name="ComicBatmanConfidential"/> In ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #31, the superhero [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]] enters the Joker's mind and sees the criminal's former self - a violent sociopath who [[zoosadism|tortures animals]], murders his own parents, and kills for fun while committing robberies.<ref name="BraveandBold31Review"/> Snyder's "[[Batman: Zero Year|Zero Year]]" (2013) suggests that the pre-disfigured Joker was a criminal mastermind leading a gang of Red Hoods.<ref name="IGNEndgame"/><ref name="OriginZeroYear"/>

The Joker has claimed a number of origins, including being the child of an abusive father who broke his nose, and the long-lived jester of an Egyptian pharaoh. As Batman says: "Like any other comedian, he uses whatever material will work."{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=136}}

===Alternative versions===
{{Main|Alternative versions of Joker}}
A number of [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]]s in DC Comics publications allow writers to introduce variations on the Joker, in which the character's origins, behavior, and morality differ from the mainstream setting.<ref name="Multiverse"/> ''The Dark Knight Returns'' depicts the final battle between an aged Batman and Joker; others portray the aftermath of the Joker's death at the hands of a number of characters, including Superman.<ref name="JokerBioGeek3"/><ref name="OtherInjustice"/> Still others describe distant futures in which the Joker is a [[computer virus]] or a hero trying to defeat the era's tyrannical Batman.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=38}} In some stories, the Joker is someone else entirely; ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' portrays Batman's mother [[Martha Wayne]] becoming the Joker after being driven mad by her son's murder,<ref name="OtherFlashpoint"/> and in ''[[Superman: Speeding Bullets]]'', [[Lex Luthor]] becomes the Joker in a world where Superman is Batman.<ref name="OtherSpeeding"/>

==Characterization==
Renowned as Batman's greatest enemy,<ref name="ImpactRama2013"/><ref name="GRadarGreatest"/><ref name="IGNRogues"/><ref name="DOGGreatest"/> the Joker is known by a number of nicknames, including the Clown Prince of Crime, the Harlequin of Hate, the Ace of Knaves, and the Jester of Genocide.<ref name="IGNRogues"/><ref name="Nicknames"/> During the evolution of the [[DC Universe]], interpretations and versions of the Joker have taken two main forms. The original, dominant image is that of a [[Psychopathy|psychopath]]{{sfn|Langley|2012|p=130}} with genius-level intelligence and a warped, sadistic sense of humor.<ref name="CrackingUp"/><ref name="ComicsComix"/> The other version, popular in comic books from the late 1940s to the 1960s and in the 1960s television series, is an eccentric, harmless prankster and thief.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=69}} Like other long-lived characters, the Joker's character and cultural interpretations have changed with time; however, unlike other characters who may need to reconcile or ignore previous versions to make sense, more than any other comic book character, the Joker thrives on his mutable and irreconcilable identities.{{sfn|Weiner|Peaslee|2015|p=33}} The Joker is typically seen in a purple suit with a long-tailed, padded-shoulder jacket, a string tie, gloves, striped pants and [[Spats (footwear)|spats]] on pointed-toe shoes (sometimes with a wide-brimmed hat). This appearance is such a fundamental aspect of the character that when the 2004 animated series ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' placed the Joker in a straitjacket, it quickly redesigned him in his familiar suit.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=69}}

The Joker is obsessed with Batman, the pair representing a [[yin-yang]] of opposing dark and light force; although it is the Joker who represents humor and color and Batman who dwells in the dark.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=37}} No crime – including murder, theft, and [[terrorism]] – is beyond the Joker, and his exploits are theatrical performances that are funny to him alone. Spectacle is more important than success for the Joker, and if it is not spectacular it is boring.{{sfn|Weiner|Peaslee|2015|p=XIX}} Although the Joker claims indifference to everything, he secretly craves Batman's attention and validation.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=105}}<ref name="BronzeAge6"/> The character was described as having killed over 2,000 people in ''[[The Joker: Devil's Advocate]]'' (1996). Despite this body count, he is always found [[Insanity defense|not guilty by reason of insanity]] and sent to [[Arkham Asylum]], avoiding the [[death penalty]].<ref name="JokerDevilsAdvocate"/>{{sfn|Langley|2012|pp=162–163}} Many of the Joker's acts attempt to force Batman to kill; to the Joker, the greatest victory would be to make Batman become like him. The Joker displays no instinct for self-preservation, and is willing to die to prove his point that anyone could become like him after "one bad day".<ref name="ImpactMoral3"/> The Joker is the "personification of the irrational," and represents "everything Batman [opposes]."<ref>{{cite book|first=Bill|last=Boichel|chapter=Batman: Commodity as Myth|title=The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and His Media|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=London, England|date=1991|isbn=978-0-85170-276-6|pages=6–7}}</ref>

===Personality===
[[File:ComicCon2008jerryrobinson.jpg|upright|left|thumb|alt=Smiling, bearded white-haired man|Joker co-creator [[Jerry Robinson]] in 2008; he conceived the Joker as an exotic, enduring archvillain who could repeatedly challenge Batman]]
The Joker's main characteristic is his apparent insanity, although he is not described as having any particular psychological disorder. Like a psychopath, he lacks empathy, a conscience, and concern over right and wrong. In ''Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth'', the Joker is described as capable of processing outside sensory information only by adapting to it. This enables him to create a new personality every day (depending on what would benefit him) and explains why, at different times, he is a mischievous clown or a psychopathic killer.{{sfn|Langley|2012|pp=180–181}} In "The Clown at Midnight" (''Batman'' #663 (April 2007)), the Joker enters a meditative state where he evaluates his previous selves to consciously create a new personality, effectively modifying himself for his needs.{{sfn|Weiner|Peaslee|2015|p=217}}

''The Killing Joke'' (in which the Joker is the [[unreliable narrator]]) explains the roots of his insanity as "one bad day": losing his wife and unborn child and being disfigured by chemicals, paralleling Batman's origin in the loss of his parents. He tries (and fails) to prove that anyone can become like him after one bad day by torturing Commissioner Gordon, physically and psychologically.<ref name="Personality2"/>{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=188}} Batman offers to rehabilitate his foe; the Joker apologetically declines, believing it too late for him to be saved.<ref name="PersonalityTKJ"/> Other interpretations show that the Joker is fully aware of how his actions affect others and that his insanity as merely an act.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=37}} Comics scholar [[Peter Coogan]] describes the Joker as trying to reshape reality to fit himself by imposing his face on his victims (and fish) in an attempt to make the world comprehensible by creating a twisted parody of himself. Englehart's "The Laughing Fish" demonstrates the character's illogical nature: trying to copyright fish that bear his face, and not understanding why threatening the copyright clerk cannot produce the desired result.<ref name="BronzeAge20"/>{{sfn|Langley|2012|pp=183–184}}

The Joker is alternatively depicted as sexual and [[asexuality|asexual]].{{sfn|Duncan Smith|2013|p=379}} In ''The Dark Knight Returns'' and ''Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth'', the Joker is seductive toward Batman; it is uncertain if their relationship has [[homoerotic]] undertones or if the Joker is simply trying to manipulate his nemesis. Frank Miller interpreted the character as fixated on death and uninterested in sexual relationships, while Robinson believed that the Joker is capable of a romantic relationship.{{sfn|Duncan Smith|2013|p=379}} His relationship with Harley Quinn is abusively paradoxical; although the Joker keeps her at his side, he heedlessly harms her (for example, throwing her out a window without seeing if she survives). Harley loves him, but the Joker does not reciprocate her feelings, chiding her for distracting him from other plans.{{sfn|Langley|2012|pp=177–180}}

Snyder's "Death of the Family" describes the Joker as in love with Batman, although not in a traditionally romantic way. The Joker believes that Batman has not killed him because he makes Batman better and he loves the villain for that.<ref name="ModernAge14"/><ref name="CharacterDOTF"/> ''Batman'' comic book writer [[Peter Tomasi]] concurred, stating that the Joker's main goal is to make Batman the best that he can be.{{sfn|Weiner|Peaslee|2015|p=XXI}} The Joker and Batman represent opposites: the extroverted Joker wears colorful clothing and embraces chaos, while the introverted, monochromatic Batman represents order and discipline. The Joker is often depicted as defining his existence through his conflict with Batman. In 1994's "Going Sane", the villain tries to lead a normal life after Batman's (apparent) death, only to become his old self again when Batman reappears; in "Emperor Joker", an apparently omnipotent Joker cannot destroy Batman without undoing himself. Since the Joker is simply "the Joker", he believes that Batman is "Batman" (with or without the costume) and has no interest in what is behind Batman's mask, ignoring opportunities to learn Batman's secret identity.<ref name="JokerBioGeek3"/>{{sfn|Manning|2011|pp=37–38}} Given the opportunity to kill Batman, the villain demurs; he believes that without their game, winning is pointless.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=105}} The character has no desire for typical criminal goals like money or power; his criminality is designed only to continue his game with Batman.<ref name="JokerBioGeek"/>

The Joker is portrayed as having no fear; when fellow supervillain [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] doses him with fear toxin in ''[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]'' (1993), the Joker merely laughs and says "Boo!"<ref name="DetectiveComic664"/> The villain has been temporarily rendered sane by several means, including [[Telepathy|telepathic]] manipulation by the [[Martian Manhunter]]<ref name="PersonalityTKJ"/> and being resurrected in a Lazarus Pit (an experience typically inducing temporary insanity in the subject). At these moments, the Joker is depicted as expressing remorse for his crimes;<ref name="ComicLotDarkKnight145"/><ref name="ComicJLA15"/> however, during a medically induced period of partial sanity in ''[[Batman: Cacophony]]'', he tells Batman, "I don't hate you 'cause I'm crazy. I'm crazy 'cause I hate you," and confirms that he will only stop killing when Batman is dead.<ref name="CraveCacophony"/><ref name="ComicCacophony"/>

===Skills and equipment<!--'Joker venom' redirects here-->===
[[File:Joker (DC Comics character).jpg|thumb|The Joker's lapel often holds an acid-spraying flower]]
The Joker has no inherent superhuman abilities.<ref name="ImpactWhatCulture"/> He commits crimes with a variety of weaponized thematic props such as a deck of razor-tipped playing cards, rolling marbles, [[jack-in-the-box]]es with unpleasant surprises and exploding cigars capable of leveling a building. The flower in his lapel sprays acid, and his hand often holds a lethal joy buzzer conducting a million volts of electricity, although both items were introduced in 1952 as harmless joke items.<ref name="JokerGadgets"/>{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=70}} However, his chemical genius provides his most-notable weapon: Joker venom, a liquid or gaseous toxin that sends its targets into fits of uncontrollable laughter; higher doses can lead to paralysis, coma or death, leaving its victim with a ghoulish, pained rictus grin. The Joker has used venom since his debut; only he knows the formula, and is shown to be gifted enough to manufacture the toxin from ordinary household chemicals. Another version of the venom (used in ''Joker: Last Laugh'') makes its victims resemble the Joker, susceptible to his orders.<ref name="BronzeAge6"/><ref name="JokerBioGeek2"/><ref name="WeaponsVenom"/>{{sfn|Manning|2011|pp=69, 124}} The villain is immune to venom and most poisons; in ''Batman'' #663 (April 2007), Morrison writes that being "an avid consumer of his own chemical experiments, the Joker's immunity to poison concoctions that might kill another man in an instant has been developed over years of dedicated abuse."<ref name="Batman663"/>{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=69}}

The character's arsenal is inspired by his nemesis' weaponry, such as [[batarang]]s. In "The Joker's Utility Belt" (1952), he mimicked [[Batman's utility belt]] with non-lethal items, such as Mexican jumping beans and sneezing powder.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=70}} In 1942's "The Joker Follows Suit", the villain built his versions of the [[Batplane]] and [[Batmobile]], the Jokergyro and Jokermobile (the latter with a large Joker face on its hood), and created a Joker-signal with which criminals could summon him for their heists.{{sfn|Manning|2011|pp=70,75}} The Jokermobile lasted for several decades, evolving with the Batmobile. His technical genius is not limited by practicality, allowing him to hijack Gotham's television airwaves to issue threats, transform buildings into death traps, launch a gas attack on the city and rain poisoned glass shards on its citizens from an airship.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=75}}<ref name="IGNJokerStories"/>

The Joker is portrayed as skilled in [[melee]] combat, from his initial appearances when he defeats Batman in a sword fight (nearly killing him), and others when he overwhelms Batman but declines to kill him.{{sfn|Manning|2011|pp=24, 37–38, 105}} He is talented with firearms, although even his guns are theatrical; his long-barreled revolver often releases a flag reading "Bang", and a second trigger-pull launches the flag to skewer its target.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=70}}<ref name="Debut"/> Although formidable in combat, the Joker's chief asset is his mind.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=38}}

===Relationships===
{{see also|List of Batman family enemies}}
The Joker's unpredictable, homicidal nature makes him one of the most feared supervillains in the DC Universe; the [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]] says in the 1995 miniseries ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'', "When super-villains want to scare each other, they tell Joker stories."<ref name="BatmanUnauthorized"/><ref name="UnderworldUnleashed"/> Gotham's villains also feel threatened by the character; depending on the circumstances, he is as likely to fight with his rivals for control of the city as he is to join them for an entertaining outcome.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=83}} The Joker interacts with other supervillains who oppose Batman, whether he is on the streets or in Arkham Asylum. He has collaborated with criminals like the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]], the [[Riddler]] and [[Two-Face]], although these partnerships rarely end well due to the Joker's desire for unbridled chaos, and he uses his stature to lead others (such as [[Killer Croc]] and the Scarecrow).{{sfn|Manning|2011|pp=83, 86}} The Joker's greatest rival is the smartest man in the world, [[Lex Luthor]]. Although they have a friendly partnership in 1950's ''World's Finest Comics'' #88, later unions emphasized their mutual hostility and clashing egos.{{sfn|Manning|2011|pp=86,93}}

Despite his tendency to kill subordinates on a whim, the Joker has no difficulty attracting henchmen with a seemingly infinite cash supply and intimidation; they are too afraid of their employer to refuse his demands that they wear red clown noses or laugh at his macabre jokes.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=75}} Even with his unpredictability and lack of superhuman powers, the 2007 limited series ''Salvation Run'' sees hundreds of villains fall under his spell because they are more afraid of him than the alternative: Luthor.{{sfn|Manning|2011|pp=124, 126}} ''Batman'' #186 (1966) introduced the Joker's first sidekick: the one-shot character Gaggy Gagsworthy, who is short and dressed like a clown; the character was later resurrected as an enemy of his replacement, Harley Quinn.<ref name="SidekickGaggy"/><ref name="SidekickGaggy2"/> Introduced in the 1992 animated series, Quinn is the Joker's former Arkham psychiatrist who develops an obsessive infatuation with him and dons a red-and-black [[harlequin]] costume to join him as his sidekick and on-off girlfriend. They have a classic [[abusive relationship]]; even though the Joker constantly insults, hurts, and even tries to kill Harley, she always returns to him, convinced that he loves her.<ref name="SidekickGaggy2"/>{{sfn|Manning|2011|pp=143, 152}} The Joker is sometimes shown to keep [[spotted hyena]]s as pets; this trait was introduced in the 1977 animated series ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]]''.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=75}} A 1976 issue of ''[[Batman Family]]'' introduced [[Duela Dent]] as the Joker's daughter, though her parentage claim was later proven to be false.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=177}}

Although his chief obsession is Batman, the character has occasionally ventured outside Gotham City to fight Batman's superhero allies. In "To Laugh and Die in Metropolis" (1987) the character kidnaps [[Lois Lane]], distracting Superman with a nuclear weapon. The story is notable for the Joker taking on a (relative) god and the ease with which Superman defeats him—it took only 17 pages. Asked why he came to Metropolis, the Joker replies simply: "Oh Superman, why not?"{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=121}} In 1995, the Joker fought his third major DC hero: [[Wonder Woman]], who drew on the Greek god of trickery to temper the Joker's humor and shatter his confidence.{{sfn|Manning|2011|pp=121–122, 124}} The character has joined supervillain groups like the Injustice Gang and the Injustice League to take on superhero groups like the Justice League.<ref name="Teamup1"/><ref name="Teamup2"/>

==Literary analysis==
[[File:Joker expo.jpg|thumb|alt=A large playing card bearing the Joker's face stands before a series of art works featuring the Joker|A 2015 art exhibition at the [[Barcelona International Comics Convention]] focused on the Joker, celebrating the character's 75th anniversary<ref name="SalondeBarcelona"/>]]
Since the Bronze Age of Comics, the Joker has been interpreted as an archetypal [[trickster]], displaying talents for cunning intelligence, social engineering, pranks, theatricality, and [[idiom]]atic humor. Like the trickster, the Joker alternates between malicious violence and clever, harmless whimsy.{{sfn|Weiner|Peaslee|2015|pp=109, 195}} He is amoral and not driven by ethical considerations, but by a shameless and insatiable nature, and although his actions are condemned as evil, he is necessary for cultural robustness.{{sfn|Weiner|Peaslee|2015|p=111}} The trickster employs amoral and immoral acts to destabilize the status quo and reveal cultural, political, and ethical hypocrisies that society attempts to ignore.{{sfn|Weiner|Peaslee|2015|p=109}} However, the Joker differs in that his actions typically only benefit himself.{{sfn|Weiner|Peaslee|2015|p=112}} The Joker possesses abnormal body imagery, reflecting an inversion of order. The trickster is simultaneously subhuman and superhuman, a being that indicates a lack of unity in body and mind.{{sfn|Weiner|Peaslee|2015|p=195}} In ''Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth'', the Joker serves as Batman's trickster guide through the hero's own psyche, testing him in various ways before ultimately offering to cede his rule of the Asylum to Batman.{{sfn|Weiner|Peaslee|2015|p=205}}

Rather than the typical [[Anarchism|anarchist]] interpretation, others have analysed the character as a [[Marxism|Marxist]] (opposite to Batman's capitalist), arguing that anarchism requires the rejection of all authority in favor of uncontrolled freedom.{{sfn|Weiner|Peaslee|2015|p=95}} The Joker rejects most authority, but retains his own, using his actions to coerce and consolidate power in himself and convert the masses to his own way of thinking, while eliminating any that oppose him.{{sfn|Weiner|Peaslee|2015|p=21}} In ''The Killing Joke'', the Joker is an abused member of the [[Proletariat|underclass]] who is driven insane by failings of the social system.{{sfn|Weiner|Peaslee|2015|p=96}} The Joker rejects material needs, and his first appearance in ''Batman'' #1 sees him perpetrate crimes against Gotham's wealthiest men and the judge who had sent him to prison.{{sfn|Weiner|Peaslee|2015|p=98}} Batman is wealthy, yet the Joker is able to triumph through his own innovations.{{sfn|Weiner|Peaslee|2015|p=99}}

Ryan Litsey described the Joker as an example of a "[[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzschean Superman]]," arguing that a fundamental aspect of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s [[Übermensch|Superman]], the "will to power," is exemplified in all of the Joker's actions, providing a [[Master–slave morality|master morality]] to Batman's slave morality.{{sfn|Weiner|Peaslee|2015|p=22}} The character's indomitable "will to power" means he is never discouraged by being caught or defeated and he is not restrained by guilt or remorse.{{sfn|Weiner|Peaslee|2015|p=185}} Joker represents the master, who creates rules and defines them, who judges others without needing approval, and for whom something is good because it benefits him.{{sfn|Weiner|Peaslee|2015|pp=185–6}} He creates his own morality and is bound only by his own rules without aspiring to something higher than himself, unlike Batman, the slave, who makes a distinction between good and evil, and is bound to rules outside of himself (such as his avoidance of killing) in his quest for justice.{{sfn|Weiner|Peaslee|2015|pp=187–8}} The Joker has no defined origin story that requires him to question how he came to be, as like the Superman he does not regret or assess the past and only moves forward.{{sfn|Weiner|Peaslee|2015|p=189}}

The Joker's controlling and abusive relationship with Harley Quinn has been analyzed as a means of the Joker reinforcing his own belief in his power in a world where he may be killed or neutralized by another villain or Batman.{{sfn|Weiner|Peaslee|2015|pp=83–84}} Joker mirrors his identity through Harley in her appearance, and even though he may ignore or act indifferent towards her, he continues to try to subject her to his control.{{sfn|Weiner|Peaslee|2015|pp=83–84}} When Harley successfully defeats Batman in ''[[The Batman Adventures: Mad Love|Mad Love]]'' (1994), the Joker, emasculated by his own failure, severely injures her out of fear of what the other villains will think of him; however, while Harley recovers, the Joker sends her flowers, which she accepts, reasserting his control over her.{{sfn|Weiner|Peaslee|2015|pp=86–87}}

Harley's co-creator, [[Paul Dini]], describes their relationship as Harley being someone who makes the Joker feel better about himself, and who can do the work that he does not want to do himself.{{sfn|Weiner|Peaslee|2015|p=87}} In the 1999 one-shot comic ''Batman: Harley Quinn'', the Joker decides to kill Harley, after admitting that he does care for her, that their relationship is romantic, and that these feelings prevent him from fulfilling his purpose.{{sfn|Weiner|Peaslee|2015|pp=85–86}} Removing the traditional male-female relationship, such as in the ''Batman: Thrillkiller'' storyline where the Joker (Bianca Steeplechase) is a female and involved in a [[lesbian]] relationship with Harley, their relationship lacks any aspects of violence or subjugation.{{sfn|Weiner|Peaslee|2015|pp=90–91}}

These debates weigh the positive (stopping the Joker permanently) against its effect on Batman's character and the possibility that he might begin killing all criminals.<ref name="ImpactMoral3"/><ref name="ImpactMoral1"/><ref name="ImpactMoral2"/>

The Joker's popularity (and his role as Batman's enemy) has involved the character in most ''Batman''-related media, from television to video games.<ref name="ImpactCBR"/><ref name="Origin3"/> These adaptations of the character have been received positively<ref name="GoldenAge2"/> on film,<ref name="ImpactAFI100" /><ref name="ImpactTime2013"/> television,<ref name="ImpactTVGuide"/> and in video games.<ref name="ImpactGRadar"/> As in the comics, the character's personality and appearance shift; he is campy, ferocious or unstable, depending on the author and the intended audience.<ref name="GoldenAge2"/>

Since 2012–2013, the Joker has inspired a large number of [[internet meme]]s, often focused on the character's portrayal in films (see below). According to Steven T. Wright of ''[[The Outline (website)|The Outline]]'', the character "came to symbolize the archetype of the 'edgelord,' a vapid, self-styled provocateur who prides himself in his ability to '[[trigger warning|trigger]]' those who hold [[progressivism|progressive]] viewpoints."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wright |first1=Steven T. |title=Why Joker memes took over the internet |url=https://theoutline.com/post/6263/joker-meme-history-gamer-joker |website=[[The Outline (website)|The Outline]] |date=September 19, 2018}}</ref> The phrase "We live in a society" is commonly associated with the Joker in memes; it garnered particular notoriety after a trailer for the film ''[[Zack Snyder's Justice League]]'' (2021) featured Joker saying the line.<ref name="Society"/><ref name="SocietyDeletedScene"/>

The Joker has appeared in a variety of media, including television series, animated and live-action films.

A darker version of the Joker named [[Joker (Jack Napier)|Jack Napier]] (played by [[Jack Nicholson]]) made his film debut in 1989's ''Batman'', which earned over $400&nbsp;million at the worldwide box office. The role was a defining performance in Nicholson's career and was considered to overshadow Batman's, with film critic [[Roger Ebert]] saying that the audience must sometimes remind themselves not to root for the Joker.<ref name="Media3"/><ref name="MediaEbert"/> ''Batman''{{'}}s success led to the 1992 television series, ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''.

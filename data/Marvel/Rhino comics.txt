Rebelling against the scientists responsible for his transformation, Rhino used his newfound powers to become a successful criminal, and soon clashed with superheroes like [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Hulk]]. The character is typically portrayed as a dimwitted brute, capable of great destruction, but ultimately easily deceived.

One of Spider-Man's most prominent adversaries, the Rhino has been adapted into various forms of media since his original debut during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], including [[animated television series]] and [[video game]]s. He has also featured in Marvel merchandise such as [[action figure]]s and [[trading card]]s.

[[Paul Giamatti]] played a version of Aleksei Sytsevich who uses a rhinoceros-themed battle armor, similar to the character's [[Ultimate Marvel]] incarnation, in the 2014 film ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]''.

==Fictional character biography==
=== Origin and early villainy ===
Aleksei Sytsevich was a member of the [[Russian mafia]] who willingly underwent a series of chemical and radiation treatments meant to give him an artificial skin covering that would grant superhuman strength. After successfully completing the treatment, Sytsevich rebelled against the [[Eastern Bloc]] agents who gave him these powers, destroying their laboratory. He was subsequently hired to kidnap [[Colonel]] [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] and obtain the extraterrestrial [[spore]]s to which Jameson was exposed during a space mission, but Sytsevich was defeated by the superhero [[Spider-Man]] and taken to prison.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #41–43 (Oct. – Dec. 1966)</ref>

After serving his sentence, the Rhino was approached by the same scientists for more augmentation. This time, they used the same [[gamma radiation]] that granted the [[Hulk]] his abilities to further increase the Rhino's strength. They also equipped him with a more durable, acid-proof suit that would further increase his abilities. The Rhino agreed to find and kidnap Bruce Banner, the Hulk's human [[alter ego]], for his knowledge of gamma radiation. Despite the Rhino's training and equipment, he was easily defeated by the Hulk, who placed him in a [[coma]].<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #104 (June 1968)</ref>

Months later, the Rhino was revived by the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]], who planned to interrupt Banner's wedding to [[Betty Ross]]. The Leader intended to transform Banner into the Hulk, and wanted the Rhino to protect him from the ensuing rampage. At the wedding, the Rhino betrays the Leader and attacks Banner the moment he transforms.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #124 (Feb. 1970)</ref> In the resulting chaos, the Rhino is once again comatose, and the Leader briefly takes mental control of Sytsevich's body to combat the Hulk.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #157–159 (Nov. 1972 – Jan. 1973)</ref> The Leader abandons the Rhino and the Hulk on an alien world, and return home in a rocket, which crashes on arrival.

The Rhino's first collaboration with other villains occurs when he and the [[Abomination (character)|Abomination]] activated a [[gamma bomb]] at the [[Hulkbusters|Hulkbuster]] base in an attempt to destroy the Hulk. Although this attempt failed, [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Egghead]] recruited the Rhino for his supervillain team, the [[Emissaries of Evil]], where he was paired with [[Solarr]] in search of a rare jewel.<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=299}}</ref> Rhino and Solarr are defeated by the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], [[Doctor Strange]],<ref>''Defenders'' #42–43 (Dec. 1976 – Jan. 1977)</ref> and [[Doc Samson]].<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #218 (Dec. 1977)</ref>

Samson took the Rhino to Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S., where he was part of a failed prison break involving [[Karla Sofen|Moonstone]], [[Blackout (Marcus Daniels)|Blackout]], and [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]].<ref>''Avengers'' #236–237 (Oct. – Nov. 1983)</ref> While being transferred to another facility, the [[Miracle Man]] attempted to free the Rhino, who wanted to stay in P.E.G.A.S.U.S. for medical treatment. The rocket crash had permanently affixed the Rhino's costume to his body, and he wanted it separated. He and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] successfully stopped Miracle Man, and took the Rhino to a medical facility within P.E.G.A.S.U.S.<ref>''Thing'' #24 (June 1985)</ref>

When the treatments fail to return the Rhino to normal, he escapes P.E.G.A.S.U.S. and joins the [[Sinister Syndicate]], fighting Spider-Man on multiple occasions.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #280–281 (Sep. – Oct. 1986)</ref> After the team falls apart, the Rhino is hired by the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] under the belief that he can raise the money for more surgery. When he hears the Kingpin tell a group of scientists not to remove the Rhino suit, Sytsevich kidnaps one of their children until they complete the procedure. Sytsevich then requests a removable suit from [[Justin Hammer]], allowing him to continue his life of crime.<ref>''Deadly Foes of Spider-Man'' #4 (Aug. 1991)</ref>

===''Civil War'' and aftermath===
When the Rhino accidentally kills a security guard during a bank robbery, he is humiliated by the [[Punisher]], and captured by [[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kravinoff]], the son of [[Kraven the Hunter]]. The Punisher rescues the Rhino from Kravinoff's superhuman zoo, and he is convinced to make amends. The Rhino sends a letter and money to the security guard's widow,<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' (vol. 2) #13–15 (Jan. – Mar. 2008)</ref> and aids the Punisher on a case.<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' (vol. 2) #23 (Nov. 2008)</ref> Later, the Rhino persuades the Punisher not to kill Michael Watts, the third [[Stilt-Man]].<ref>''[[Punisher War Journal]]'' (vol. 2) #26</ref>

During ''[[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt|The Gauntlet]]'' storyline, the Rhino gives up his life of crime, surrendering himself to the police. S.H.I.E.L.D. removes his Rhino suit and sentences him to 25 years on Ryker's Island. He is released early on good behavior, and upon release, he meets Doctor Tramma, who wants to reinvent the Rhino. Sytsevich declines, and Tramma creates a new Rhino. At Spider-Man's persuasion, Sytsevich refuses to fight the new Rhino.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #617">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #617 (March 2010)</ref> That promise is broken when Sytsevich's wife Oksana is killed, and a grief-stricken Sytsevich kills the new Rhino.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #625">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #625 (March 2010)</ref>

[[Doctor Octopus]] recruits the Rhino for his iteration of the [[Sinister Six]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #648. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the ''[[Ends of the Earth (Marvel Comics)|Ends of the Earth]]'' storyline, the Rhino tells Spider-Man that the loss of his wife has changed him, and he is prepared to die. When Doctor Octopus self-destructs his own lair, the Rhino pins [[Silver Sable]] to the floor of a flooding corridor, knowing that Spider-Man will blame himself for his fellow hero's death.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #687. Marvel Comics.</ref> He is presumed drowned, and while in Doctor Octopus' dying body, Spider-Man meets Oksana and the Rhino in the afterlife.<ref>[[Slott, Dan]] (w). ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #700. Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== ''All-New, All-Different Marvel'' ===
As part of the lead-up to the ''[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]'' storyline, the Rhino resurfaces, having survived his apparent demise. The [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]] finds Sytsevich in hiding in Tahuexco, [[Guatemala]], where he persuades the Rhino to do his bidding with the promise of a revived Oksana.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 4) #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Doctor Octopus activates a virus in all of the Jackal's clones that causes them to rapidly decay, Oksana turns to dust, and the Rhino goes on a grief-stricken rampage.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #4-5. Marvel Comics.</ref> Spider-Man calms him by convincing him to move forward for his wife's sake, and the two agree to see each other once in a while to help the other with their pain.<ref>''Clone Conspiracy: Omega'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In a prelude to the "Hunted" storyline, the Rhino is among the animal-themed characters captured by the [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] and the [[Eric O'Grady#Black Ant|Black Ant]] on behalf of Kraven the Hunter. He is among those who [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] publicly reveals as the [[Savage Six]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 5) #16. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[King in Black]]" storyline, Rhino is among the villains recruited by Mayor [[Kingpin (character)|Wilson Fisk]] to be part of his [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] at the time of [[Knull (character)|Knull]]'s invasion. Following the deaths of Ampere and Snakehead, Taskmaster couldn't bring himself to prevent Rhino from walking away.<ref>''King in Black: Thunderbolts'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Sinister War]]" storyline, Rhino accompanied the Savage Six into attacking the premiere of the movie which Mysterio was involved in. This led up to the Savage Six also fighting the Sinister Six.<ref>''Sinister War'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Devil's Reign]]" storyline, Rhino appears as a member of Mayor Wilson Fisk's latest incarnation of the Thunderbolts when Mayor Fisk passes a law that forbids superhero activities. He assisted [[Agony (comics)|Agony]], Electro II, and [[U.S. Agent]] in taking down [[Moon Knight]].<ref>''Devil's Reign'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> In truth, Rhino did not signing up to dispose underage superheroes after learning the Kamala's Law incidents in ''[[Outlawed (comics)|Outlawed]]'' and its conclusion in ''Killer App'', so he secretly helps the Champions by giving them the Thunderbolts badge due to Fisk's patrol system becoming even tighter with Doctor Octopus' Octobots and many innocent people being unsaved.<ref>''Devil's Reign'' #2 - 4. Marvel Comics.</ref> It was because of Rhino declaring himself out of the Thunderbolts because of this reason that caused Mayor Fisk to bring in [[Abomination (character)|Abomination]] as a replacement.<ref>''Devil's Reign'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Devil's Reign: Villains for Hire'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
A series of [[Mutagen|mutagenic chemical]] and radiation treatments provide the Rhino with unnatural strength, speed, stamina, and durability, all which were further augmented by even more gamma rays. His incredible speed allows him to run at high velocities, especially over short distances. Sytsevich frequently "charges" his opponents in this manner, enabling him to cause great harm to most enemies in the surrounding area. He is, however, notorious for his lack of agility and slow reaction time, which makes it difficult for him to change direction when running at high speeds. As such, his fighting style is focused more on melee attacks.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z'' Vol 1 #9 (July 2009)</ref>

===Rhino suit===
Sytsevich possesses a thick [[polymer]] suit that resembles the physique of a [[rhinoceros]], including two horns, and covers everything but his face. The suit is resistant to damage and extreme temperatures and these horns are capable of penetrating two-inch plate steel. His first, cruder suit was originally bonded to his skin in the aftermath of a rocket crash and he went through several attempts to have the suit removed.

After the first suit's destruction, Justin Hammer created a second, removable iteration. The second suit allows Sytsevich to withstand high caliber bullets, thermal attacks, and most impact forces. It also further increases his strength and durability.

==Other characters named Rhino==
===Doctor Tramma's Rhino===
When Aleksei Sytsevich declines Doctor Tramma's offer to return to the Rhino role, Tramma finds another subject and equips him with a high-tech suit that was supposed to be given to Sytsevich. The second Rhino comes after Sytsevich, feeling that he had to destroy the original Rhino if he was going to [[Rapture|ascend]]. Spider-Man defeats the second Rhino, who then escapes.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #617"/>

While lifting a makeshift dumbbell made out of a pole and two trucks, the second Rhino is called up by a mysterious person telling him where he can find Sytsevich. Rhino attacks Aleksei at one of [[J. Jonah Jameson]]'s press meetings. Aleksei lies to the second Rhino, agreeing to fight him in his Rhino suit, but instead goes into hiding with his wife Oksana. Before they arrive at their safehouse, however, the second Rhino attacks again, and Oksana dies as a result. Aleksei dons his old Rhino suit, which is strong enough to destroy the new Rhino's, and kills the unnamed wearer.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #625"/>

He then rampages through a busy city street. The original [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Man]] tries to escape school in order to confront O'Hirn, but cannot get there in time, and the R.H.I.N.O. is defeated by [[Iron Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Iron Man]].<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #28.

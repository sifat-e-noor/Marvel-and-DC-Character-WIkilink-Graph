[[Conan the Barbarian]] by [[Robert E. Howard]] was first adapted into [[comics]] in 1952 in Mexico. [[Marvel Comics]] began publishing '''Conan''' comics with the series ''Conan the Barbarian'' in 1970. [[Dark Horse Comics]] published [[Conan (Dark Horse Comics)|Conan]] from 2003 to 2018, after which the rights were reacquired by Marvel Comics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/conan-barbarian-comics-moving-back-marvel-1074351|title='Conan the Barbarian' Comics Moving Back to Marvel|last=McMillan|first=Graeme|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=January 12, 2018|access-date=January 13, 2018}}</ref>

==''La reina de la Costa Negra''==
The first comic book adaptation of a Howard Conan story was the feature ''[[La reina de la Costa Negra]]'' (taken from the original Conan story, "[[Queen of the Black Coast]]") in the miniature-size Mexican anthology title ''Cuentos de Abuelito'' #8 (1952) published by Corporacion Editorial Mexicana, SA.<ref name="Shanks 2013 5">{{Harvtxt|Shanks|2013|p=5}}</ref> The series features the main characters, Conan and [[Bêlit (Robert E. Howard)|Bêlit]], though Conan is depicted as blond rather than black-haired.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Lord|1976|p=333}}</ref> Issues 8 through 12 adapted the original Howard story, while subsequent issues featured original material. The feature ran in nearly every issue of ''Cuentos de Abuelito'' up through number 61.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Shanks|2013|pp=4–5}}</ref> A digest-sized standalone series, ''La reina de la Costa Negra'', was published by Ediciones Mexicanas Asocidas in 1958–1959 which lasted for at least eleven issues. In 1965–66 Ediciones Joma published a standard-size ''La reina de la Costa Negra'' comic that ran for at least 53 issues.<ref name="Shanks 2013 5"/>

==Marvel Comics==
{{main|Conan the Barbarian (comics)}}

Marvel Comics introduced a version of Conan in 1970 with ''[[Conan the Barbarian (comic)|Conan the Barbarian]]'', written by Roy Thomas with art initially by [[Barry Windsor-Smith]], then [[John Buscema]] and Ernie Chan (aka Ernie Chua). The successful ''Conan the Barbarian'' series spawned the more adult, black-and-white ''[[Savage Sword of Conan]]'' in 1974, by Thomas, Buscema, and [[Alfredo Alcala]]. ''Savage Sword of Conan'' soon became one of the most popular comic series in the 1970s.{{fact|date=April 2022}}

The Marvel Conan stories were also adapted as a newspaper comic strip which appeared daily and Sunday from September 4, 1978, to April 12, 1981. Originally written by Roy Thomas and illustrated by John Buscema, the strip was continued by several different Marvel artists and writers.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Degg |first=D.

Other Marvel Conan titles over the years include ''[[Savage Tales]]'' (1971–1975, issues 1–5 only), ''Giant-Size Conan'' (1974–1975), ''King Conan/Conan the King'' (1980–1989), ''Conan the Adventurer'' (1994–1995), ''Conan'' (1995–1996), and ''Conan the Savage'' (1995–1996).

After the 2019 return of Conan to Marvel titles included ''Conan: Serpent War'' (2019–2020 miniseries), ''Conan: Battle for the Serpent Crown'' (2020 miniseries), alongside the reappearance of ''Conan the Barbarian'' (2019-present) and ''Savage Sword of Conan'' (2019), which both received new #1s but retained the original "Legacy Numbering" continuing where their original Marvel series left off.

Conan later appeared in the pages of ''[[Savage Avengers]]''.

''King Conan'' caused controversy when it included a character named Matoaka, the real name of [[Pocahontas]], and with a sexualized design and a backstory similar to that of the actual Native American woman. There was backlash at what was perceived a disrespectful portrayal, so Marvel announced that name would be changed in later issues, reprints and digital editions. Writer Jason Aaron issued an apology, and pointed that "This new character is a supernatural, thousand-year-old princess of a cursed island within a world of pastiche and dark fantasy and was never intended to be based on anyone from history".<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cbr.com/marvel-king-conan-pocahontas-name-change/|title=Marvel Changes King Conan 'Pocahontas' Character's Name in Digital and Future Printings|author= Jeremy Blum|date= March 3, 2022|publisher= CBR|accessdate=May 16, 2022}}</ref>

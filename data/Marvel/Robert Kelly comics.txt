'''Robert Edward Kelly''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He most often appears in Marvel's ''[[X-Men]]'' related [[comic book]]s. He is a prominent [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] who began his career on an anti-[[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] platform and tended to be an antagonist to the X-Men team. But towards the later days of his career, he began to change his views on mutants as a whole.

==Publication history==
The character was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and makes his first appearance in ''The [[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #135 (July 1980).

==Fictional character biography==
Senator Robert Kelly was first seen at a social gathering hosted by the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], where an illusion projected by the mutant villain [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]] caused him to believe he had witnessed the X-Man [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] firing randomly into a crowd. He was the primary backer of the [[Registration Acts (comics)|Mutant Control Act]] and [[Project Wideawake]], a government program aimed at creating updated [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] robots that would help track down, detain and, if necessary, kill violent mutants.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #135. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Senator Kelly played a central role in the ''[[Days of Future Past]]'' storyline. The entire plot revolved around the X-Men stopping [[Mystique (character)|Mystique]] and the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] from assassinating him and thus inadvertently causing a dystopian future where mutants and other heroes were hunted down by the Sentinels and nearly totally eliminated.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #141-142. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Senator Kelly was later married to Sharon, a former maid who worked in the Hellfire Club.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #246. Marvel Comics.</ref> Kelly, in a meeting with [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]], was shocked when his wife walked in wearing her old servant garb as a bit of fun. Sharon was genuinely apologetic, saying she would not have done such a thing if it hadn't been just him and Shaw. Sharon was killed, shot by [[Master Mold]] during a battle between the mutant-hunting robot and [[Rogue (Marvel Comics)|Rogue]]. This further incited Robert's stance against mutantkind.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #247 (August 1989). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Senator Kelly remained an active anti-mutant activist in the comics through the 1990s, but slowly became more open-minded and tolerant towards the mutant population, promising the X-Men he would work for the rights of mutants during the early 2000s. After his life was saved by the mutant [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)|Pyro]] in an attack (this was when Pyro was infected with the [[Legacy Virus]]) from [[Post (comics)|Post]], Kelly vowed to reconsider his standing on mutants and work towards improving human/mutant relations. Despite being guarded by the X-Man [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], he was not long afterward assassinated at a college rally (where he was speaking at the time) by the anti-mutant activist Alan Lewis who felt that Kelly betrayed their anti-mutant cause. He died in Cable's arms after Cable had been too occupied helping [[Jean Grey]] save Charles Xavier on the astral plane to realize the danger to Kelly before it was too late. With his dying breaths, he pleaded for Cable not to give up on his dream. Cable's failure to protect the reformed Kelly, coupled with the devastating loss of [[Moira MacTaggert]] who was murdered by Mystique, led Cable to leave the X-Men not long afterward.<ref>''X-Men'' #108 (2001). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Box prison for mutant criminals was also known as the Robert Kelly Correction Facility where it was named in honor of him.<ref>''X-Men Gold'' vol. 2 #23. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Creation==
The character's name was chosen by Chris Claremont, in honor of his [[Bard College]] professor, the poet [[Robert Kelly (poet)|Robert Kelly]]. The latter has confirmed the connection between the two names in interviews among his students.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Marvel Comics.</ref>

===X-Men: Noir===
In the ''[[X-Men Noir]]'' reality, Robert Kelly was a Republican Senator of New York who strongly defended the controversial U.S. extraterritorial prison Genosha Bay. Kelly believed through eugenics that it is necessary for containing criminals who are more exceptionally dangerous and from "infecting" the public with their criminal ways. However, in reality, Kelly's true purpose of keeping Genosha Bay was because it was the proving grounds in recruiting the next generation of ideal soldiers and government operatives.<ref>''X-Men Noir: Mark of Cain'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Secret Wars===
During the "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline, a version of Robert Kelly existed as the appointed Baron of the [[Battleworld]] domain known as Westchester.

He was last seen meeting with Apocalypse to plan the future for Westchester.<ref>''X-Men '92'' #1-4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The '''Fantastic Four''' is a [[superhero]] team appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The team debuted in ''[[The Fantastic Four (comic book)|The Fantastic Four]]'' #1 ([[cover date]]d Nov. 1961), helping usher in a new level of realism in the medium. It was the first superhero team created by artist/co-plotter [[Jack Kirby]] and editor/co-plotter [[Stan Lee]], who developed a collaborative approach to creating comics with this title.

The four characters traditionally associated with the Fantastic Four, who gained [[superpower (ability)|superpowers]] after exposure to [[cosmic ray]]s during a scientific mission to outer space, are: [[Reed Richards|Mister Fantastic]] (Reed Richards), a scientific genius and the leader of the group, who can stretch his body into incredible lengths and shapes; the [[Invisible Woman]] (Susan "Sue" Storm), who eventually married Reed, who can render herself invisible and project powerful invisible force fields and blasts; the [[Human Torch]] (Johnny Storm), Sue's younger brother, who can generate flames, surround himself with them and fly; and the monstrous [[Ben Grimm|Thing]] (Ben Grimm), their grumpy but benevolent friend, a former college football star, Reed's college roommate and a good pilot, who possesses tremendous superhuman strength, durability and endurance due to his stone-like flesh.

Since the 1961 introduction, the Fantastic Four has been portrayed as a somewhat dysfunctional, yet loving, family. Breaking convention with other comic archetypes, the members squabbled, held grudges both deep and petty, and eschewed anonymity or secret identities in favor of celebrity status. They are also well known for their recurring encounters with characters such as the villainous monarch [[Doctor Doom]]; the planet-devouring [[Galactus]]; the [[Kree|Kree Empire]]'s ruthless and tyrannical enforcer [[Ronan the Accuser]]; the [[Negative Zone]]'s ruler [[Annihilus]]; the sea-dwelling prince [[Namor]]; the spacefaring [[Silver Surfer]]; and the [[Skrull]] warrior [[Super Skrull|Kl'rt]].

The Fantastic Four have been adapted into [[mass media|other media]], including four [[animated series]] and four [[Fantastic Four in film|live-action films]].

{{Further|Fantastic Four (comic book)}}

===Origins===
Apocryphal legend has it that in 1961, longtime [[magazine]] and [[comic book]] [[publishing|publisher]] [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]] was playing golf with either [[Jack Liebowitz]] or [[Irwin Donenfeld]] of rival company [[DC Comics]], then known as National Periodical Publications, <!--also known as name is mentioned here because Stan Lee says "National Comics" in quote directly below this paragraph--> and that the top executive bragged about DC's success with the new superhero team the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]].<ref group=note>That DC all-star superhero team had debuted in ''The Brave and the Bold'' #28 ([[cover-date]]d Feb. 1960) before going on to its own hit title (issue #1 cover-dated Nov. 1960).</ref> While film producer and comics historian [[Michael Uslan]] has debunked the particulars of that story,<ref group=note>Uslan, in a letter published in ''Alter Ego'' #43 (December 2004), pp. 43–44, writes: "Irwin Donenfeld said he never played golf with Goodman, so the story is untrue. I heard this story more than a couple of times while sitting in the lunchroom at DC's 909 Third Avenue and 75 Rockefeller Plaza office as Sol Harrison and [production chief] Jack Adler were schmoozing with some of us... who worked for DC during our college summers.... [T]he way I heard the story from Sol was that Goodman was playing with one of the heads of Independent News, not DC Comics (though DC ''owned'' Independent News). ... As the distributor of DC Comics, this man certainly knew all the sales figures and was in the best position to tell this tidbit to Goodman. ... Of course, Goodman would want to be playing golf with this fellow and be in his good graces. ... Sol worked closely with Independent News' top management over the decades and would have gotten this story straight from the horse's mouth."</ref> Goodman, a publishing trend-follower, aware of the JLA's strong sales, did direct his comics editor, [[Stan Lee]], to create a comic-book series about a team of superheroes. According to Lee, writing in 1974, "Martin mentioned that he had noticed one of the titles published by National Comics seemed to be selling better than most. It was a book called ''The'' {{sic}} ''Justice League of America'' and it was composed of a team of superheroes. ... 'If the Justice League is selling', spoke he, 'why don't we put out a comic book that features a team of superheroes?'"<ref name="Origins">{{Cite book | last=Lee | first=Stan | author-link=Stan Lee | title=Origins of Marvel Comics | publisher= [[Simon & Schuster]]/[[Marvel Fireside Books|Fireside Books]]<!--Book predates publisher's change to ampersand in corporate name--> | date=September 1974|location= New York, New York| isbn=978-0-671-21863-8}}</ref>{{Rp|16}}

Lee, who had served as editor-in-chief and art director of Marvel Comics and its predecessor companies, [[Timely Comics]] and [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], for two decades, found that the medium had become creatively restrictive. Determined "to carve a real career for myself in the nowhere world of comic books",<ref group=note>{{Cite book | last=Lee | first=Stan | author-link=Stan Lee | title=Origins of Marvel Comics | publisher= [[Simon & Schuster]]/[[Marvel Fireside Books|Fireside Books]]<!--Book predates publisher's change to ampersand in corporate name--> | date=September 1974|location= New York, New York| isbn=978-0-671-21863-8 | quote=[My wife] Joan was commenting about the fact that after 20 years of producing comics I was still writing television material, advertising copy and newspaper features in my spare time.

And the characters would be the kind of characters I could personally relate to: they'd be flesh and blood, they'd have their faults and foibles, they'd be fallible and feisty, and — most important of all — inside their colorful, costumed booties they'd still have feet of clay."<ref name="Origins"/>{{Rp|17}}

Lee provided one of his earliest recorded comments on the creation of the Fantastic Four for a fanzine in 1968, during which time Jack Kirby was also working at Marvel (Kirby himself is interviewed separately in the same publication). When asked who conceived the team, him or Kirby, Lee responded "Both – 'twas mainly my idea, but Jack created characters visually".<ref name="StufSaid">{{cite book |last1=Morrow |first1=John |title=Kirby & Lee: Stuf' Said!

I wrote a detailed first synopsis for Jack to follow and the rest is history."<ref name="Origins"/>{{Rp|18}} Kirby turned in his penciled art pages to Lee, who added dialogue and captions. This approach to creating comics, which became known as the "[[Marvel Method]]", worked so well that Lee and Kirby used it from then on, and the Marvel Method became standard for the company within a year.<ref name="Daniels">{{Cite book | last=Daniels | first=Les | author-link=Les Daniels | title=Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics | publisher=[[Abrams Books|Harry N.

Kirby recalled events somewhat differently. In a 1970 Fanzine interview he confirmed Lee's involvement in the creation of the Fantastic Four but took credit for the main characters and ideas, stating "It was my idea. It was my idea to do it the way it was; my idea to develop it the way it was.  I'm not saying Stan had nothing to do with it.  Of course he did.  We talked things out."<ref name="Rockets Blast Comic Collector">{{cite book |last1=Love |first1=GB |title=Rockets Blast Comic Collector 81 |date=1970 |publisher=GB Love}}</ref> Years later, when specifically challenged with Lee's version of events in a 1990 interview, Kirby responded: "I would say that's an outright lie",<ref name="GG">{{Cite journal | last=Groth | first=Gary | title=Interview III: 'I've never done anything halfheartedly' | journal=[[The Comics Journal]] | issue=134|publisher=Fantagraphics Books |date=February 1990|location= Seattle, Washington}} Reprinted in {{Cite book | editor-last=George | editor-first=Milo | title=The Comics Journal Library Volume 1: Jack Kirby | publisher=Fantagraphics Books | date=May 2002|location= Seattle, Washington | isbn=1-56097-434-6}}</ref>{{Rp|39}} although the interviewer, [[Gary Groth]], notes that this statement needs to be viewed with caution.<ref group=note>Groth explains in his 2002 introduction to the interview that Kirby's state of mind needs to be taken into consideration when evaluating certain statements within the interview. Kirby was involved in an acrimonious dispute with Marvel Comics regarding the return of his artwork, and his relationship with Lee had deteriorated, in part due to this dispute but also due to Lee's public statements through the years, which Kirby saw as diminishing his role. Groth states: "Lee's contribution is a matter for endless speculation, but most observers and historians consider Kirby's claims here to be excessive."</ref> Kirby claims he came up with the idea for the Fantastic Four in Marvel's offices, and that Lee merely added the dialogue after the story was pencilled.<ref name="GG"/>{{Rp|38}} Kirby also sought to establish, more credibly and on numerous occasions, that the visual elements of the strip were his conceptions. He regularly pointed to a team he created for rival publisher DC Comics in the 1950s, the [[Challengers of the Unknown]]. "[I]f you notice the uniforms, they're the same... I always give them a skintight uniform with a belt... the Challengers and the FF have a minimum of decoration. And of course, the Thing's skin is a kind of decoration, breaking up the monotony of the blue uniform."<ref>{{Cite interview | last=Kirby | first=Jack | subject-link=Jack Kirby | interviewer=Tim Skelly | title=Interview II: 'I created an army of characters, and now my connection to them is lost' | publisher=[[WNUR-FM]]|location= Evanston, Illinois| work=The Great Electric Bird | date=May 14, 1971}} Transcribed and published in ''The Nostalgia Journal'' #27.

Given the conflicting statements, outside commentators have found it hard to ascertain who created the Fantastic Four. A typed synopsis by Lee for the introductory segment of the first Fantastic Four issue exists and outlines the characters and their origins, with various minor differences to the published version. However Earl Wells, writing in ''The Comics Journal'', points out that its existence does not assert its place in the creation: "[W]e have no way of knowing of whether Lee wrote the synopsis after a discussion with Kirby in which Kirby supplied most of the ideas".<ref name="WE">{{Cite journal | last=Wells | first=Earl | title=Once and For All, Who Was the Author of Marvel | journal=The Comics Journal | issue=181 | date=October 1995|location= Seattle, Washington}} Reprinted in George, ''The Comics Journal Library''.</ref>{{Rp|78}}

It is also notable that the Fantastic Four's first adventure in 1961 depicts a team of four adventurers (three men and a woman) led by a Professor travelling to the Earth’s centre and encountering giant monsters while contending with a human protagonist who is also from the surface world.<ref name="JackStanFan FF1">{{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=Stan |last2=Kirby |first2=Jack |title=Fantastic Four Volume 1 Number 1 |date=November 1962 |publisher=Canam Publishers Sale Corp |pages=26–32}}</ref> Although neither Lee nor Kirby ever mentioned the 1959 film ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959 film)|Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'' as a direct inspiration, publisher Martin Goodman was well known for following popular entertainment trends to attract sales in his comics line.<ref name="JackStanFan">{{cite book |last1=Van Lente |first1=Fred |last2=Dunlavey |first2=Ryan |title=The Comic Book History of Comics |date=2012 |publisher=IDW |isbn=978-1613771976 |pages=102–103}}</ref>

Comics historian [[R. C.

===1961–1970s===
The release of ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|The Fantastic Four]]'' #1 (Nov. 1961) was an unexpected success. Lee had felt ready to leave the comics field at the time, but the positive response to ''Fantastic Four'' persuaded him to stay on.<ref name="century"/> The title began to receive fan mail<ref>{{cite book|last1 = DeFalco|first1 = Tom|author-link = Tom DeFalco|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 84|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= It did not take long for editor Stan Lee to realize that ''The Fantastic Four'' was a hit...the flurry of fan letters all pointed to the FF's explosive popularity.}}</ref> and Lee started printing the letters in a letter column with issue #3. Also with the third issue, Lee created the hyperbolic slogan "The Greatest Comic Magazine in the World!!" With the following issue, the slogan was changed to "The World's Greatest Comic Magazine!" and became a fixture on the issue covers into the 1990s,<ref name="Daniels"/>{{Rp|87}} and on numerous covers in the 2000s.

Issue #4 (May 1962) reintroduced [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]],<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 86: "Stan Lee and Jack Kirbuy reintroduced one of Marvel's most popular Golden Age heroes – Namor, the Sub-Mariner."</ref> an aquatic [[antihero]] who was a star character of Marvel's earliest iteration, [[Timely Comics]], during the late 1930s and 1940s period that historians and fans call the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age of Comics]]. Issue #5 (July 1962) introduced the team's most frequent nemesis, [[Doctor Doom]].<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 86: "The introduction of Dr. Doom signaled a slight shift in direction for Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. At last they were moving away from their monster-book formulas to embrace the super hero genre. Dr. Doom was their first real attempt to create an enduring super villain."</ref> These earliest issues were published bimonthly. With issue #16 (July 1963), the cover title dropped its ''The'' and became simply ''Fantastic Four''.

While the early stories were complete narratives, the frequent appearances of these two antagonists, Doom and Namor, in subsequent issues indicated the creation of a long narrative by Lee and Kirby that extended over months. According to comics historian [[Les Daniels]], "only narratives that ran to several issues would be able to contain their increasingly complex ideas".<ref name="Daniels"/>{{Rp|88}} During its creators' lengthy run, the series produced many acclaimed storylines and characters that have become central to Marvel, including the hidden race of alien-human genetic experiments, the [[Inhumans]];<ref>{{cite web | first= Brian|last= Cronin|url= http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/09/18/a-year-of-cool-comics-day-261/|title= A Year of Cool Comics – Day 261|website=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date= September 18, 2010|access-date= September 29, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101123190418/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/09/18/a-year-of-cool-comics-day-261/|archive-date=November 23, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="DeFalco111">DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 111: "The Inhumans, a lost race that diverged from humankind 25,000 years ago and became genetically enhanced."</ref> the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]],<ref>{{cite web |first= Brian|last= Cronin|url= http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/09/19/a-year-of-cool-comics-day-262/|title= A Year of Cool Comics – Day 262|website=Comic Book Resources|date= September 19, 2010| access-date= September 29, 2010|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110708181411/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/09/19/a-year-of-cool-comics-day-262/|archive-date=July 8, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> an African king who would be mainstream comics' first black superhero;<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 117: Stan Lee wanted to do his part by creating the first black super hero.

Byrne revitalized the slumping title with his run.<ref name="Wright"/>{{Rp|265}} Byrne was slated to write with Sienkiewicz providing the art however, Sienkiewicz left to do ''[[Moon Knight]]'', and Byrne subsequently became writer, artist, and inker. Various editors were assigned to the comic; eventually [[Bob Budiansky]] became the regular editor. Byrne told [[Jim Shooter]] that he could not work with Budiansky, although they ultimately continued to work together. In 2006, Byrne said "that's my paranoia. I look back and I think that was Shooter trying to force me off the book". Byrne left following issue #293 (Aug. 1986) in the middle of a story arc, explaining he could not recapture the fun he had previously had on the series.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Cooke | first=Jon B. |author2=Eric Nolen-Weathington | title=Modern Masters Volume Seven: John Byrne | publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing | year=2006|location= Raleigh, North Carolina| pages=42–44 | isbn=978-1-893905-56-6}}</ref> One of Byrne's changes was making the Invisible Girl into the Invisible Woman:<ref>DeFalco "1980s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 221: "After freeing herself from the Psycho-Man's control, Susan changed her name from the Invisible Girl to the Invisible Woman."</ref> assertive and confident. During this period, fans came to recognize that she was quite powerful, whereas previously, she had been primarily seen as a superpowered mother and wife in the tradition of television moms like those played by [[Donna Reed]] and [[Florence Henderson]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://fantasticfour.ugo.com/?cur=jessica-alba&gallery=true|title= Jessica Alba – Fantastic Four Girls|publisher= [[UGO]]|access-date= March 6, 2009|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080406003917/http://fantasticfour.ugo.com/?cur=jessica-alba&gallery=true|archive-date=April 6, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Byrne staked new directions in the characters' personal lives, having the married Sue Storm and Reed Richards suffer a miscarriage and the Thing quitting the Fantastic Four, with [[She-Hulk]] being recruited as his long-term replacement. He also re-emphasized the family dynamic which he felt the series had drifted away from after the Lee/Kirby run, commenting that, "''[[Family]]''—and not ''[[dysfunctional family]]''—is the central, key element to the FF. It is an absolutely vital dynamic between the characters." [emphases in original]<ref name="Back38"/>

Byrne was followed by a quick succession of writers: [[Roger Stern]], [[Tom DeFalco]], and [[Roy Thomas]]. [[Steve Englehart]] took over as writer for issues 304–332 (except #320). The title had been struggling, so Englehart decided to make radical changes. He felt the title had become stale with the normal makeup of Reed, Sue, Ben, and Johnny, so in issue #308 Reed and Sue retired and were replaced with the Thing's new girlfriend, [[Sharon Ventura]], and Johnny Storm's former love, Crystal. The changes increased readership through issue #321. At this point, Marvel made decisions about another Englehart comic, ''[[West Coast Avengers]]'', that he disagreed with, and in protest he changed his byline to S.F.X. Englehart (S.F.X. is the abbreviation for Simple Sound Effects). In issue #326, Englehart was told to bring Reed and Sue back and undo the other changes he had made. This caused Englehart to take his name entirely off the book. He used the pseudonym John Harkness, which he had created years before for work he didn't want to be associated with. According to Englehart, the run from #326 through his last issue, #332, was "one of the most painful stretches of [his] career."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.steveenglehart.com/Comics/Fantastic%20Four%20304-321.html |title=''Fantastic Four'' 304–332 |last=Englehart |author-link=Steve Englehart |first=Steve |website=SteveEnglehart.com |pages=1–3 |access-date=March 9, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319012324/http://www.steveenglehart.com/comics/Fantastic%20Four%20304-321.html |archive-date=March 19, 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> Writer-artist [[Walt Simonson]] took over as writer with #334 (December 1989), and three issues later began [[penciller|pencilling]] and [[inker|inking]] as well. With brief inking exceptions, two fill-in issues, and a three-issue stint drawn by [[Arthur Adams (comics)|Arthur Adams]],<ref name="Manning252">Manning, Matthew K.

Simonson, who had been writing the team comic ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'', had gotten approval for Reed and Sue to join that team after Engelhart had written them out of ''Fantastic Four''. Yet by ''The Avengers'' #300, where they were scheduled to join the team, Simonson was told the characters were returning to ''Fantastic Four''. This led to Simonson quitting ''The Avengers'' after that issue. Shortly afterward, he was offered the job of writing ''Fantastic Four''. Having already prepared a number of stories involving the Avengers with Reed and Sue in the lineup, he then rewrote these for ''Fantastic Four''. Simonson later recalled that working on ''Fantastic Four'' allowed him the latitude to use original Avengers members [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Iron Man]], which he had been precluded from using in ''The Avengers''.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Nolen-Weathington | first=Eric | title=Modern Masters Volume Eight: Walter Simonson | publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing | year=2006|location= Raleigh, North Carolina| page=66 | isbn=978-1-893905-64-1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ILopomw3UpMC&q=%22fantastic+four%22+Steve+Englehart&pg=PA65}}</ref>

After another fill-in, the regular team of writer and Marvel editor-in-chief [[Tom DeFalco]], penciller [[Paul Ryan (cartoonist)|Paul Ryan]] and inker Dan Bulanadi took over, with Ryan self-inking beginning with #360 (Jan. 1992). That team, with the very occasional different inker, continued for years through #414 (July 1996). DeFalco nullified the Storm-Masters marriage by [[retroactive continuity|retconning]] that the alien Skrull Empire had kidnapped the real Masters and replaced her with a spy named [[Lyja]]. Once discovered, Lyja, who herself had fallen for Storm, helped the Fantastic Four rescue Masters. Ventura departed after being further mutated by Doctor Doom. Although some fans were not pleased with DeFalco's run on ''Fantastic Four'', calling him "The Great Satan", the title's sales rose steadily over the period.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=12309|title= Brand New (May) Day: DeFalco talks ''Amazing Spider-Girl''|last= Manning|first= Shaun|date= January 15, 2008|website=Comic Book Resources|access-date= March 10, 2009|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131019204901/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=12309|archive-date= October 19, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fantasticfourheadquarters.co.uk/blog/tom-defalco-interview|title=Blog Posts|website=Fantasticfourheadquarters.co.uk}}</ref>

Other key developments included Franklin Richards being sent into the future and returning as a teenager; the return of Reed's time-traveling father, Nathaniel, who is revealed to be the father of time-travelling villain [[Kang the Conqueror]] and Reed's apparent death at the hands of a seemingly mortally wounded Doctor Doom.<ref>Manning "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 265: "In this issue penned by Tom DeFalco and penciled by Paul Ryan, Dr. Doom...managed to lure Reed Richards to him and seemingly ended both of their lives"</ref> It would be two years before DeFalco resurrected the two characters, revealing that their "deaths" were orchestrated by the supervillain [[Hyperstorm]].

The ongoing series was canceled with issue #416 (Sept. 1996) and relaunched with vol. 2 #1 (Nov. 1996) as part of the multi-series "[[Heroes Reborn (1996 comic)|Heroes Reborn]]" [[Crossover (comics)|crossover]] story arc. The yearlong volume retold the team's first adventures in a more contemporary style,<ref>Manning "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 280: "Jim Lee both wrote and drew this Heroes Reborn relaunch title with the help of fellow scripter Brandon Choi."</ref> and set in a parallel universe. Following the end of that experiment, ''Fantastic Four'' was relaunched with vol. 3 #1 (Jan. 1998). Initially by the team of writer [[Scott Lobdell]] and penciller [[Alan Davis]],<ref>Manning "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 288: "Writer Scott Lobdell rearranged his X-schedule to try his hand at writing a different team of Marvel heroes in this new Heroes Reborn series. It was drawn by Alan Davis."</ref> it went after three issues to writer [[Chris Claremont]] (co-writing with Lobdell for #4–5) and penciller [[Salvador Larroca]]; this team enjoyed a long run through issue #32 (Aug. 2000).

===2000s===
Following the run of Claremont, Lobdell and Larroca, [[Carlos Pacheco]] took over as penciller and co-writer, first with [[Rafael Marín]], then with Marín and [[Jeph Loeb]]. This series began using dual numbering, as if the original ''Fantastic Four'' series had continued unbroken, with issue #42 / #471 (June 2001). At the time, the Marvel Comics series begun in the 1960s, such as ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' and ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', were given such dual numbering on the front cover, with the present-day volume's numbering alongside the numbering from the original series. After issue #70 / #499 (Aug. 2003), the title reverted to its original vol. 1 numbering with issue #500 (Sept. 2003).

[[Karl Kesel]] succeeded Loeb as co-writer with issue #51 / #480 (March 2002), and after a few issues with temporary teams, [[Mark Waid]] took over as writer with #60 / 489 (October 2002) with artist [[Mike Wieringo]] with Marvel releasing a promotional variant edition of their otherwise $2.25 debut issue at the price of nine cents US.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/fantfou6.htm#S462|publisher=  The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators|title= ''Fantastic Four'' (III) (1998–2003)}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Mark Waid|Waid, Mark]]|penciller= [[Mike Wieringo|Wieringo, Mike]]|inker= [[Karl Kesel|Kesel, Karl]]|story= Inside Out|title= Fantastic Four|volume= 3|issue= 60|date= October 2002}}</ref> Pencillers [[Mark Buckingham (comic book artist)|Mark Buckingham]], Casey Jones, and Howard Porter variously contributed through issue #524 (May 2005), with a handful of issues by other teams also during this time.

As a result of the events of the "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" company-crossover storyline, the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] temporarily replaced Reed and Susan Richards on the team.

In the storyline ''Point of Origin'', the Fantastic Four entrust Alicia, H.E.R.B.I.E., Franklin and Valeria to protect Earth while they begin their mission to learn a further origin of the cosmic radiation that granted them their powers in the first place, piloting a new space ship called Marvel-2.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' Vol. 6 #14.

Revos subsequently mutated his people to "prepare for their return" before trying to eradicate the mutates who are unable to retain their original forms in the same manner as the Thing, accusing the mutates of being "villains and imperfects"; as a result, through his own paranoia and xenophobia, the Overseer himself is responsible for the fateful creation of the Fantastic Four and mutated his entire race to face a non-existent threat.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' Vol. 6 #15-17.

===2020s===
In August of 2022, Marvel announced that writer [[Ryan North]] and artist Iban Coello would launch a new volume of Fantastic Four in November of that year after Slott had concluded his run on the title with issue #46.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/fantastic-four-1-2022-ryan-north-iban-coello-new-era | title=A New Era of 'Fantastic Four' Begins with Ryan North & Iban Coello }}</ref>

==Spin-offs==
Ancillary titles and features spin off from the flagship series include the 1970s quarterly ''Giant-Size Fantastic Four'' and the 1990s ''Fantastic Four Unlimited'' and ''Fantastic Four Unplugged''; ''[[Fantastic Force]]'', an 18-issue spinoff (November 1994 – April 1996) featuring an adult Franklin Richards, from a different timeline, as Psi-Lord. A 12-issue series ''Fantastic Four: The World's Greatest Comics Magazine'' ran in 2001, paying homage to [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]'s legendary run. A spinoff title ''[[Marvel Knights 4]]'' (April 2004 – August 2006) was written by [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] and initially illustrated by [[Steve McNiven]]<ref>Manning "2000s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 321: "Playwright Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa and artist Steve McNiven focused on the family dynamic that holds the Fantastic Four together in this new ongoing series."</ref> in his first Marvel work. There have also been numerous [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] featuring the group.

In 1996, Marvel launched the series ''[[Fantastic Four 2099]],'' part of the company's [[Marvel 2099]] imprint which explored an alternate future of the Marvel Universe. The four protagonists inexplicably find themselves in 2099, with the world believing them to be clones of the original members of the Fantastic Four. The series ran for 8 issues (Jan. – Aug. 1996), serving as a companion to ''[[Doom 2099]]''—an original Marvel 2099 title featuring an individual claiming to be the original [[Doctor Doom|Victor von Doom]].

In 2004, Marvel launched ''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]''. As part of the company's [[Ultimate Marvel]] imprint, the series re-imagined the team as teenagers.<ref>Manning "2000s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 320: "Brian Michael Bendis, Mark Millar, and Adam Kubert reexamined Marvel's first family, creating this alternate version of the Fantastic Four."</ref> It ran for 60 issues (Feb. 2004 – Feb. 2009). In 2008, they also launched ''Marvel Adventures: Fantastic Four'', an out-of-continuity series aimed at younger readers.

Although it was launched by Marvel as a continuation of the Fantastic Four title in 2011, ''[[Future Foundation|FF]]'' continued publication as a separate series after the regular series resumed in 2012. From issues #12, the title focused on the youthful members of the Future Foundation, including Franklin and Valeria Richards. A second volume was launched as part of [[Marvel NOW!]] by [[Matt Fraction]] and [[Mike Allred]] depicting a substitute Fantastic Four team starring [[Ant-Man|Scott Lang]], [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]], [[She-Hulk]] and Ms. Thing.

===Solo series===
====The Human Torch solo====
The Human Torch was given a solo strip in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' in 1962 to bolster the title's sales.<ref name="Daniels"/>{{Rp|98}} The series began in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #101 (October 1962), in 12- to 14-page stories plotted by Lee and initially scripted by his brother [[Larry Lieber]], and drawn by penciller Kirby and inker [[Dick Ayers]].

Here, Johnny was seen living with his older sister, Susan, in fictional Glenview, [[Long Island]], New York, where he continued [[High school (North America)|high school]] and, with youthful naiveté, attempted to maintain a "secret identity". In ''Strange Tales'' #106 (March 1963), Johnny discovered that his friends and neighbors knew of his dual identity all along from Fantastic Four news reports, but were humoring him. Supporting characters included Johnny's girlfriend, Doris Evans, usually in consternation as Johnny cheerfully flew off to battle bad guys. She was seen again in a 1973 issue of ''Fantastic Four'', having become a heavyset but cheerful wife and mother.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Gerry Conway|Conway, Gerry]]|penciller= [[John Buscema|Buscema, John]]|inker= Sinnott, Joe|story= A Dragon Stalks the Skies|title= Fantastic Four|issue= 134|date= May 1973}}</ref> Ayers took over the penciling after ten issues, later followed by original [[Human Torch (android)|Golden Age Human Torch]] creator [[Carl Burgos]] and others. The Fantastic Four made occasional cameo appearances, and the Thing became a co-star with issue #123 (Aug. 1964).

The Human Torch shared the split book ''[[Strange Tales]]'' with fellow feature [[Doctor Strange]] for the majority of its run, before being replaced in issue #135 (August 1965) by [[Nick Fury|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.]] The Silver Age stories were republished in 1974, along with some Golden Age Human Torch stories, in a short-lived ongoing ''Human Torch'' series.

A later ongoing solo series in Marvel's [[manga]]-influenced [[Tsunami (Marvel Comics)|Tsunami]] [[Imprint (trade name)|imprint]], ''Human Torch'', ran 12 issues (June 2003 – June 2004), by writer [[Karl Kesel]] and [[penciler]] [[Skottie Young]].<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/10987/ ''Human Torch'', Marvel, 2003 series] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref> The series was followed by the five-issue limited series ''Spider-Man/Human Torch'' (March–July 2005), an untold tales [[team-up]] arc spanning the course of their friendship.

====The Thing solo====
The Thing appeared in two team-up issues of ''[[Marvel Feature]]'' (#11–12, September–November 1973). Following their success, he was given his own regular team-up title ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'', co-starring with Marvel heroes not only in the present day but occasionally in other time periods (fighting alongside the [[World War II]]-era [[Liberty Legion]] in #20 and the 1930s hero [[Doc Savage]] in #21, for example) and in [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate realities]]. The series ran 100 issues (January 1974 – June 1983), with seven summer annuals (1976–1982) and was immediately followed by the solo title ''The Thing'' #1–36 (July 1983 – June 1986). Another ongoing solo series, also titled ''The Thing'', ran eight issues (January–August 2006).

====Invisible Woman solo====
In April 2019, Marvel Comics announced that it would publish ''Invisible Woman'', a five-issue miniseries written by [[Mark Waid]]. This was Sue Storm's first solo title. [[Adam Hughes]] drew the cover for Issue #1.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/invisible-woman-series-marvel-comics-mark-waid/|title=Marvel Announces 'Invisible Woman' Series|website=Marvel}}</ref>

==Characters {{Anchor|The team}}==
The Fantastic Four is formed after four civilian astronauts are exposed to [[cosmic rays]] during an unauthorized [[outer space]] test flight in an experimental [[rocket]] ship designed by Dr. Reed Richards. Pilot Ben Grimm and crew-members Susan Storm and her brother Johnny Storm survive an emergency [[Emergency landing|crash-land]]ing in a field on Earth. Upon exiting the rocket, the four discover they have developed incredible [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]] and decide to use these powers to help others.

In the first issue the crew talks about Reed Richards' rocketship flying to the stars. Stan Lee's original synopsis described the crew's plan to fly to Mars, but Lee later shortly afterward wrote that due to "the rate the Communists are progressing in space, maybe we better make this a flight to the STARS, instead of just to Mars, because by the time this mag goes on sale, the Russians may have already MADE a flight to Mars!"<ref>Note reprinted in {{cite book|last = Lee|first = Stan|title = Marvel Firsts: The 1960s|chapter= Snopses" [sic] The Fantsiuc [sic] Four July '61 Schedule (#)|publisher = Marvel Comics|year = 2011|pages = 484–485 |isbn = 978-0785158646}}</ref>

In a significant departure from preceding superhero conventions, the Fantastic Four make no effort to maintain secret identities or, until issue #3, to wear superhero costumes, instead maintaining a public profile and enjoying celebrity status for scientific and heroic contributions to society. At the same time, they are often prone to arguing and even fighting with one another. Despite their bickering, the Fantastic Four consistently prove themselves to be "a cohesive and formidable team in times of crisis."<ref name="Wright">{{Cite book | last=Wright | first=Bradford W. | year=2001 | title=Comic Book Nation: The Transformation of Youth Culture in America | url=https://archive.org/details/comicbooknationt00wrig | url-access=registration | location=Baltimore, Maryland |publisher= [[Johns Hopkins University Press]]| isbn=0-8018-7450-5}}</ref>{{Rp|204–205}}

While there have been a number of lineup changes to the group, the four characters who debuted in ''Fantastic Four'' #1 remain the core and most frequent lineup. They consist of:

* '''[[Reed Richards|Mister Fantastic]]''' (Reed Richards) - A scientific genius, can stretch, twist and re-shape his body to inhuman proportions. Mr. Fantastic serves as the father figure of the group, and is "appropriately pragmatic, authoritative, and dull".<ref name="Wright"/>{{Rp|19}} Richards blames himself for the failed space mission, particularly because of how the event transformed pilot Ben Grimm.<ref name="Wright"/>{{Rp|205}} Stan Lee said the stretch powers were inspired by DC's [[Plastic Man]], which had no equivalent in Marvel.<ref name=conversation>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zLmB3GprtboC&pg=PA179|title=Stan Lee: Conversations|editor=McLaughlin, Jeff|chapter=Stan Lee Looks Back: The Comics Legend Recalls Life with Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, and Heroes|page=179|year=2007|location= Jackson, Mississippi|publisher= [[University Press of Mississippi]]|isbn=978-1578069859}}</ref>
* '''[[Invisible Woman|Invisible Girl/Invisible Woman]]''' (Susan Storm) - Reed Richards' girlfriend (and eventual wife) has the ability to bend and manipulate light to render herself and others invisible. Stan Lee did not want Sue to have superstrength, "to be [[Wonder Woman]] and punch people", so eventually he came to invisibility, inspired by works such as ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]''.<ref name=conversation/> She later develops the ability to generate invisible force fields, which she uses for a variety of defensive and offensive effects.
* '''[[Human Torch]]''' (Johnny Storm) - Sue Storm's younger brother, possesses the ability to control fire, allowing him to project fire from his body, as well as the power to fly. This character was loosely based on a [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]] character published by Marvel's predecessor [[Timely Comics]] in the 1940s, an android that could ignite itself. Lee said that when he conceptualized the character, "I thought it was a shame that we didn't have The Human Torch anymore, and this was a good chance to bring him back".<ref name="Daniels"/>{{Rp|85}} Unlike the teen sidekicks that preceded him, the Human Torch in the early stories was "a typical adolescent — brash, rebellious, and affectionately obnoxious."<ref name="Wright"/>{{Rp|204}} Johnny Storm was killed in the 2011 storyline "Three",<ref name="JohnnyDeath2"/> before being brought back and rejoining the reformed Fantastic Four.<ref name="FF600">{{cite comic| writer= [[Jonathan Hickman|Hickman, Jonathan]]|penciller= [[Carmine Di Giandomenico|Di Giandomenico, Carmine]]|inker= Di Giandomenico, Carmine|story= Whatever Happened to Johnny Storm?|title= Fantastic Four|issue= 600|date= January 2012}}</ref>
* '''[[Ben Grimm|Thing]]''' (Ben Grimm) - Reed Richards' college roommate and best friend, has been transformed into a monstrous, orange, rock-like humanoid possessing high levels of superhuman strength and durability. The Thing is often filled with anger, self-loathing and self-pity over his new existence. He serves as "an uncle figure, a long-term friend of the family with a gruff [[Brooklyn]] manner, short temper, and caustic sense of humor".<ref name="Wright"/>{{Rp|204}} In the original synopsis Lee gave to Kirby, The Thing was intended as "the heavy", but over the years, the character has become "the most lovable group member: honest, direct and free of pretension".<ref name="Daniels"/>{{Rp|86}} Lee said his original pitch to Kirby stated that The Thing was "someone who turned into a monster" and is bitter because unlike the other three he cannot change back to a normal appearance.<ref name=conversation/>

The Fantastic Four has had several headquarters, most notably the [[Baxter Building]], located at [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]] and [[Madison Avenue]]<ref>{{cite web |last=Irving |first=Christopher |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |url=https://nymag.com/arts/books/features/55001/ |title=A Land of Geeks and Goblins |access-date=July 14, 2010 |date=March 1, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810063149/http://nymag.com/arts/books/features/55001/ |archive-date=August 10, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> in New York City. The Baxter Building was replaced by [[Four Freedoms Plaza]] at the same location after its destruction at the hands of [[Kristoff Vernard]], adopted son of the team's seminal foe [[Doctor Doom]] (prior to the completion of Four Freedoms Plaza, the team took up temporary residence at [[Avengers Mansion]]).<ref>{{Cite comic | writer= Byrne, John|penciller= Byrne, John|inker= [[Jerry Ordway|Ordway, Jerry]]|story= Towards Infinity!|title= Fantastic Four|issue= 282|date= September 1985}}</ref> Pier 4, a waterfront warehouse, served as a temporary headquarters after Four Freedoms Plaza was destroyed by the ostensible superhero team the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]<ref>{{Cite comic |writer= [[Kurt Busiek|Busiek, Kurt]]|penciller= [[Mark Bagley|Bagley, Mark]]|inker= Russell, Vince|story= Heroes' Reward|title= [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]|issue= 10|date=January 1998}}</ref> shortly after the revelation that they were actually the supervillain team the [[Masters of Evil]] in disguise.

{{main|List of Fantastic Four members}}

==Cultural impact==
The Fantastic Four's characterization was initially different from all other superheroes at the time. One major difference is that they do not [[secret identity|conceal their identities]], leading the public to be both suspicious and in awe of them. Also, they frequently argued and disagreed with each other, hindering their work as a team.<ref name="Wright"/> Described as "heroes with hangups" by Stan Lee,<ref name="Wired">{{cite magazine|url= https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.07/fantastic.html?pg=2&topic=fantastic&topic_set=|title= The Doom-Defying, Two-Fisted Marketing of Fantastic Four|last= Bing|first= Jonathon|date= July 2005|magazine= [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|access-date= 2009-02-25|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090810212954/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.07/fantastic.html?pg=2&topic=fantastic&topic_set=|archive-date= August 10, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> the Thing has a temper, and the Human Torch resents being a child among adults. Mr. Fantastic blames himself for the Thing's transformation. Social scientist Bradford W. Wright describes the team as a "volatile mix of human emotions and personalities". In spite of their disagreements, they ultimately function well as a team.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://archive.org/details/comicbooknationt00wrig|url-access= registration|quote= fantastic four.|title= Comic Book Nation|publisher= JHU Press|last= Wright|year= 2001|page = [https://archive.org/details/comicbooknationt00wrig/page/205 205]|isbn= 9780801865145}}</ref>

The first issue of ''The Fantastic Four'' proved a success, igniting a new direction for superhero comics and soon influencing many other superhero comics.<ref>{{Cite book |last= Fein|first= Eric|title= The Creation of the Fantastic Four|publisher= The Rosen Publishing Group|year= 2006|page= 6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n1KHmaeMvwcC&q=%22fantastic+four%22|isbn=978-1-4042-0765-3}}</ref> Readers grew fond of Ben's grumpiness, Johnny's tendency to annoy others and Reed and Sue's spats. Stan Lee was surprised at the reaction to the first issue, leading him to stay in the comics field despite previous plans to leave. Comics historian Stephen Krensky said that "Lee's natural dialogue and flawed characters appealed to 1960s kids looking to 'get real'".<ref name="century">{{Cite book |last= Krensky|first= Stephen|title= Comic Book Century: The History of American Comic Books| publisher= [[Lerner Publishing Group|Twenty-First Century Books]]|year= 2007|location= Minneapolis, Minnesota|page= 59|isbn=978-0-8225-6654-0| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=n23M0Bn0JmwC&q=%22fantastic+four%22&pg=PA58}}</ref>

As of 2005, 150 million comics featuring the Fantastic Four had been sold.<ref name="Wired"/>

==In other media==
There have been four ''The Fantastic Four'' [[list of animated television series|animated TV series]] and three released feature films. The Fantastic Four also guest-starred in the "Secret Wars" story arc of the 1990s [[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|''Spider-Man'' animated series]], and the Thing guest-starred (with a small cameo from the other Fantastic Four members) in the "Fantastic Fortitude" episode of the 1996 [[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|''The Incredible Hulk'' series]]. The Fantastic Four also appeared in the 2010 series ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''.

There was a short-lived [[radio programming|radio show]] in 1975 that adapted early Lee/Kirby stories<ref>{{cite web |url= http://pulpinterest.com/entertainment/fantastic-four-marvel-lous/|title= Marvel-lous – The Fantastic Four|first= Adrian|last= Carty|date= February 22, 2014|website=PulpInterest.com|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140223145956/http://www.pulpinterest.com/entertainment/fantastic-four-marvel-lous/|archive-date= February 23, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> and is notable for casting a pre-''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' [[Bill Murray]] as the Human Torch. Also in the cast were Bob Maxwell as [[Reed Richards]], Cynthia Adler as [[Sue Storm]], Jim Pappas as [[Ben Grimm]] and Jerry Terheyden as [[Doctor Doom]]. Other Marvel characters featured in the series included [[Ant-Man]], [[Prince Namor]], [[Nick Fury]] and the [[Hulk]]. Stan Lee narrated the series and the scripts were taken almost verbatim from the comic books. The radio show was packaged into five-minute segments, with five segments comprising a complete adventure.<ref name=rm100>{{cite journal|last=Mangels|first=Andy|author-link= Andy Mangels|title=Reel Marvel: Fantastic Four in the cartoons history|journal=Marvel Age|date=May 1991|volume=1|issue=100|url=http://www.andymangels.com/marvelage.html|access-date=June 25, 2012|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> The team appeared on the [[Peter Pan Records|Power Records]] album ''Fantastic Four: "The Way It Began"'' book and record set, an audio dramatization of ''Fantastic Four'' #126.<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 10254|title= Fantastic Four: ''"The Way It Began" book and record set''}}</ref>

===Television===
The Fantastic Four has been the subject of four animated television series. The first, ''[[Fantastic Four (1967 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'', produced by [[Hanna-Barbera]],<ref>{{cite book|last = Thomas|first = Roy|author-link = Roy Thomas|author2=Sanderson, Peter |author-link2=Peter Sanderson |title = The Marvel Vault: A Museum-in-a-Book with Rare Collectibles from the World of Marvel|url = https://archive.org/details/marvelvaultmuseu00thom|url-access = limited|publisher = [[Running Press]]|year = 2007|location= Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|page = [https://archive.org/details/marvelvaultmuseu00thom/page/n57 101]|isbn = 978-0762428441|quote= In 1967, ''Spider-Man'' and ''Fantastic Four'' took over Saturday morning slots on ABC-TV, the latter produced by [[Hanna-Barbera Productions]].}}</ref> ran 20 episodes on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from September 9, 1967 to September 21, 1968. The second ''[[The New Fantastic Four|Fantastic Four]]'' series, produced by [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises|DePatie-Freleng]], ran 13 episodes from September 9, 1978, to December 16, 1978; this series features a [[H.E.R.B.I.E.]] Unit in place of the Human Torch.<ref name=rm100/>

In 1979, the Thing was featured as half of the Saturday morning cartoon ''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Thing]]''. The character of the Thing received a radical make-over for the series. The title character for this program was Benjy Grimm, a teenage boy who possessed a pair of magic Thing-rings which could transform him into the Thing when he put them together and said "Thing-rings, do your thing!" The other members of the Fantastic Four do not appear in the series, nor do the animated ''[[The Flintstones]]'' stars [[Fred Flintstone]] and [[Barney Rubble]], despite the title of the program.<ref name=rm100/>
The third ''[[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' was broadcast as part of ''[[The Marvel Action Hour]]'' umbrella, with introductions by Stan Lee. This series ran 26 episodes from September 24, 1994 to February 24, 1996. The fourth series, ''[[Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes]]'', debuted on September 2, 2006, on [[Cartoon Network]] and ran for 26 episodes.

Different Fantastic Four members appear briefly and with little or no dialogue and are mentioned various times throughout the first season of ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''. The most expansive appearances are in the episode "The Private War of Doctor Doom", in which the Avengers team up with the Fantastic Four to battle the titular supervillain, and in the final episode of season two, in which the groups team up to battle [[Galactus]]. The Thing becomes a member of the New Avengers in episode 23 of season 2.

The Fantastic Four appear in the children’s show ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'', such as the episode "If this Be My Thanos" and "Last Exit Before Doomsday!" <ref>"If This Be My Thanos" ''Super Hero Squad Show''. October 24, 2009</ref> <ref>"Last Exit Before Doomsday!" ''Super Hero Squad Show''. February 13, 2010</ref> 

The Fantastic Four appear in the ''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]'' episode "Monster No More."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3802334/ |title=Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H Monster No More |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= 29 June 2014|website=IMDb.com|access-date= 3 January 2019|quote=The Fantastic Four appear in the ''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]'' episode "Monster No More.}}</ref> The Agents of S.M.A.S.H. assist the Fantastic Four in thwarting the Tribbitite Invasion.

===Film===
{{main|Fantastic Four in film}}
A film adaptation of the characters, ''[[The Fantastic Four (unreleased film)|The Fantastic Four]]'', was completed in 1994 by producer [[Roger Corman]] and starred [[Alex Hyde-White]] as Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic, [[Rebecca Staab]] as Sue Storm-Richards/Invisible Woman, [[Jay Underwood]] as Johnny Storm/Human Torch, [[Michael Bailey Smith]] as Ben Grimm and [[Carl Ciarfalio]] as The Thing and [[Joseph Culp]] as Victor von Doom/Doctor Doom. The film was not released to theaters or on home video, but it has since been made available through [[bootleg recording|bootleg]] video distributors. It was made because [[Constantin Film]] owned the film rights and would have lost them if it failed to begin production by a certain deadline, a tactic known as creating an [[ashcan copy]].<ref name=avclub>{{cite news|last1=Vishnevetsky |first1=Ignatiy |title=Our option on ''Atlas Shrugged'' expires in two days: 6-plus copyright extensions disguised as movies |url=https://www.avclub.com/article/our-option-atlas-shrugged-expires-two-days-6-plus--212280 |newspaper=[[The A.V.

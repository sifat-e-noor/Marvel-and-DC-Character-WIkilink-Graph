'''Dr. Henry Jekyll''', nicknamed in some copies of the story as Harry Jekyll, and his alternative personality, '''Mr. Edward Hyde''', is the central character of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s 1886 novella ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]''. In the story, he is a good friend of main [[protagonist]] Gabriel John Utterson. Jekyll is a kind and respected English doctor who has repressed evil urges inside of him.<ref name="Saposnik">Saposnik, Irving S. "The Anatomy of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."

==Fictional character biography==
Doctor Henry Jekyll is a [[Doctor (title)|doctor]] who feels that he is battling between the benevolence and malevolence within himself, thus leading to the struggle with his [[alter ego]] Edward Hyde. He spends his life trying to repress evil urges that are not fitting for a man of his stature. Jekyll develops a serum in an attempt to mask this hidden evil. However, in doing so, Jekyll transforms into Hyde, a hideous creature without compassion or remorse. Jekyll has a friendly personality, but as Hyde, he becomes mysterious and violent. As time goes by, Hyde grows in power and eventually manifests whenever Henry Jekyll shows signs of physical or moral weakness, no longer needing the serum to be released.

Stevenson never says exactly what Hyde does, generally saying that it is something of an evil and lustful nature. Thus, in the context of the times, it is abhorrent to [[Victorian morality|Victorian religious morality]]. Hyde may have been reeling in activities such as engaging with prostitutes or [[buggery]]. However, it is Hyde's violent activities that seem to give him the most thrills, driving him to attack and murder Sir Danvers Carew without apparent reason, making him a hunted outlaw throughout England. Carew was a client of Gabriel Utterson, Jekyll's [[lawyer]] and friend, who is concerned by Hyde's history of violence and the fact that Jekyll changed his will, leaving everything to Hyde. Dr. Hastie Lanyon, a mutual acquaintance of Jekyll and Utterson, dies of shock after receiving information relating to Jekyll. Before his death, Lanyon gives Utterson a letter to be opened after Jekyll's death or disappearance.

When Jekyll refuses to leave his lab for weeks, Utterson and Jekyll's [[butler]] Mr. Poole break into the lab. Inside, they find the body of Hyde wearing Jekyll's clothes and apparently dead from suicide. They find also a letter from Jekyll to Utterson promising to explain the entire mystery. Utterson takes the document home where he first reads Lanyon's letter and then Jekyll's. The first reveals that Lanyon's deterioration and eventual death resulted from seeing Hyde drinking a serum or potion and subsequently turning into Jekyll. The second letter explains that Jekyll, having previously indulged unstated vices (and with it the fear that discovery would lead to his losing his social position), found a way to transform himself and thereby indulge his vices without fear of detection. But Jekyll's transformed personality Hyde was effectively a sociopath — evil, self-indulgent, and utterly uncaring to anyone but himself. Initially, Jekyll was able to control the transformations, but then he became Hyde involuntarily in his sleep.

At this point, Jekyll resolved to cease becoming Hyde. One night however, the urge gripped him too strongly. After the transformation, he immediately rushed out and violently killed Carew. Horrified, Jekyll tried more adamantly to stop the transformations. For a time, he proved successful by engaging in [[Philanthropy|philanthropic]] work. One day at a park, he considered how good a person he had become as a result of his deeds (in comparison to others), believing himself redeemed. However, before he completed his line of thought, he looked down at his hands and realized that he had suddenly transformed once again into Hyde. This was the first time that an involuntary metamorphosis had happened in waking hours. Far from his laboratory and hunted by the police as a murderer, Hyde needed help to avoid being caught. He wrote to Lanyon (in Jekyll's hand) asking his friend to retrieve the contents of a cabinet in his laboratory and to meet him at midnight at Lanyon's home in [[Cavendish Square]]. In Lanyon's presence, Hyde mixed the potion and transformed back to Jekyll - ultimately leading to Lanyon's death. Meanwhile, Jekyll returned to his home only to find himself ever more helpless and trapped as the transformations increased in frequency and necessitated even larger doses of potion in order to reverse them.

Eventually, the stock of ingredients from which Jekyll had been preparing the potion ran low, and subsequent batches prepared by Dr. Jekyll from renewed stocks failed to produce the transformation. Jekyll speculated that the one essential ingredient that made the original potion work (a [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]]) must have itself been contaminated. After sending Poole to one [[chemist]] after another to purchase the salt that was running low only to find it wouldn't work, he assumed that subsequent supplies all lacked the essential ingredient that made the potion successful for his experiments. His ability to change back from Hyde into Jekyll had slowly vanished in consequence. Jekyll wrote that even as he composed his letter, he knew that he would soon become Hyde permanently, having used the last of this salt and he wondered if Hyde would face execution for his crimes or choose to kill himself. Jekyll noted that in either case, the end of his letter marked the end of his life. He ended the letter saying "I bring the life of that unhappy Henry Jekyll to an end". With these words, both the document and the novella come to a close.

The original pronunciation of "Jekyll", as used in Stevenson's native Scotland, rhymed with "treacle", thus ({{IPAc-en|audio=|'|d|ʒ|iː|k|ə|l}}).

* Loosely based on Stevenson's novel, the first season episode of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'', ''[[The Enemy Within (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Enemy Within]]'', Captain Kirk is split into two people, one evil and one good.

* The ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where are You!]]'' episode "Nowhere to Hyde" features the Ghost of Mr. Hyde (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]) who is committing jewelry store robberies and one of the suspects is a descendant of Dr. Jekyll.

* In the ''[[Dynomutt, Dog Wonder]]'' episode "Everyone Hyde!", the criminal Willie the Weasel (voiced by [[Henry Corden]]) creates a similar formula (which is related to Dr. Jekyll's formula) that turns him into Mr. Hyde.

* The grandson of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are featured in ''[[The Comic Strip (TV series)|The Comic Strip]]'' segment "Mini Monsters" voiced by [[Earl Hammond]]. He works as the camp physician at Camp Mini-Mon.

* In the ''[[Gravedale High]]'' episode "Fear of Flying", there is a medical version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) that works as a doctor for the monsters. Mr. Hyde serves as Dr. Jekyll's "partner" where Dr. Jekyll would turn into him for any second opinions of anyone's medical problems.

* In the ''[[All Dogs Go to Heaven: The Series]]'' episode "Dr. Beagle and Mangy Hyde", Charlie turns into a Mr. Hyde-like monster (voiced by [[Brad Garrett]]) when eating dog food tainted with a dangerous substance Carface had.

In the course of the series, it is revealed that the original Jekyll's transformation into Hyde was a 'natural' process, triggered by Jekyll's love for his maid rather than any kind of potion, and Jackman is the descendant of one of Hyde's bastard sons, while his wife is a clone of Jekyll's maid created by a corporation to try and duplicate the Hyde process. As with most modern adaptations, Hyde is depicted as possessing superhuman strength, able to tear a lion apart with his bare hands, and is depicted as being impulsive and childish rather than explicitly ''evil'', although the physical changes are fairly subtle, such as Hyde having darker eyes and a different hairstyle. At the series' conclusion, Hyde apparently sacrifices himself to save Jackman, "dying" when he is shot but somehow able to stop Jackman "sharing the damage", with the result that the bullets remain in Jackman but he has no injuries to demonstrate where they entered his body.

* [[NBC]]'s ''[[Do No Harm (TV series)|Do No Harm]]'' is a modern retelling of the Jekyll and Hyde story featuring a renamed Jekyll-like character named Dr. Jason Cole (played by [[Steven Pasquale]]) trying to stop his drug-addicted, sociopathic, Hyde-like counterpart named Ian Price from ruining his professional and private life.

* [[Seoul Broadcasting System|SBS]]'s ''[[Hyde, Jekyll, Me]]'' portrays a man, Goo Seo Jin, who is in line as a successor of the conglomerate group his family owns but has dissociative identity disorder. His other personality, Robin, is the opposite of his usual cold, cynical self; Robin is kind, gentle and has a savior complex.

* [[Shazad Latif]] portrays an [[Anglo-Indian]] Dr. Henry Jekyll on the third season of ''[[Penny Dreadful (TV series)|Penny Dreadful]]''. In the show, Jekyll is the illegitimate child of an English nobleman and an [[Indian people|Indian]] woman. His father abandoned Jekyll and his mother in India, and after Jekyll's mother dies from [[leprosy]], he goes to the [[University of Cambridge]], where he befriends [[Victor Frankenstein]] but is ultimately expelled from Cambridge after getting into a fight with a professor due to the professor's racist comments. He then works at [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bedlam Hospital]], developing a serum to pacify patients and bring out a calm, tame nature. In the last episode of the show, Jekyll's father dies and he inherits his title: Lord Hyde.

* The 2015 TV series ''[[Jekyll and Hyde (TV series)|Jekyll & Hyde]]'' focuses on the illegitimate grandson of Henry Jekyll named Doctor Robert Jekyll who has inherited his grandfather's Hyde personality. While Robert is initially able to control his transformation with pills, as the series unfolds, he learns about various demonic threats to the world, and is forced to harness the superhuman strength he possesses as Hyde to oppose these forces. In the course of the series, Robert Jekyll works with Henry Jekyll's old assistant and even meets Henry Jekyll's lover (and hence his grandmother), although his Hyde persona never gains a first name.

* Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde appear in ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'', with Dr. Jekyll portrayed by [[Hank Harris]] and Mr. Hyde portrayed by [[Sam Witwer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/764653/once-upon-a-time-finale-new-fairytale-characters-arrive-a-familiar-face-returns|title=Once Upon a Time Finale: New Fairytale Characters Arrive & A Familiar Face Returns - E!

In season six, Mr. Hyde strikes up an allegiance with Regina Mills' [[Evil Queen]] side. It's revealed that Jekyll's serum failed to remove his capacity for evil and he is killed by Captain Hook which causes Hyde to die as well as a side effect of the serum.

* Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde appear in ''[[Mary Shelley's Frankenhole]]'', as a minor character who only appears in a few episodes. In the show, he is depicted as a pharmacist in the village that Victor Frankenstein's castle overlooks. He constantly seeks the approval Frankenstein, who views Jekyll as nothing more than an annoyance.

Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are employed by The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen to combat the ruthless criminal known as the Fantom, who is revealed in the course of the film to be "M", the man who recruited them, and also [[Professor Moriarty]], who intends to acquire the power of the League for use in his plans to trigger a world war and sell his weapons for profit. His mole in the League, Dorian Gray, manages to acquire a sample of the Hyde serum, which he is able to duplicate, one of Moriarty's men drinking a massive overdose of the Hyde serum to become an even larger version of Hyde. Despite the other Hyde's size and raw power, he is defeated when he burns through the formula at an accelerated rate, resulting in Moriarty's fortress collapsing on top of him.

* Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde appear in ''[[Van Helsing (film)|Van Helsing]]'', with Dr. Jekyll portrayed by Stephen Fisher while [[Robbie Coltrane]] provides the voice of the [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] animated Mr. Hyde. Like the version that was seen in ''The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'', Mr. Hyde is also portrayed as a large, hulking brute. Van Helsing has pursued Hyde to [[Paris, France]] after having failed to capture him in an earlier confrontation in [[London, England]]. He is superhumanly strong and displays agility comparable to that of a [[great ape]]. While not invulnerable, he's extremely tough and sustains severe injuries that ultimately do little to impede or slow him down to any appreciable degree. Upon exchanging banter, they begin fighting in the bell tower of [[Notre Dame Cathedral]] with Van Helsing initially gaining the advantage by severing Hyde's left arm at the [[biceps]], which regresses to a normal form after landing on the floor. Hyde rallies and assaults Van Helsing, using his right arm to hurl him through the roof of the cathedral. He then gloats before tossing Van Helsing off the roof only for Van Helsing to fire a grappling gun that sends the hook & line through the center of Hyde's body, which Van Helsing uses to stop his fall. He attempts to pull Hyde off the roof, only for Hyde to begin pulling him upward, seemingly unfazed by the large hole in his body. Hyde trips over the edge of the roof, his falling weight pulling Van Helsing up to the roof before the line breaks. As it breaks, the momentum swings Hyde through the Rose Window of the cathedral and, while he falls, Hyde transforms back into the form of Henry Jekyll and dies from the fall. A [[police officer]] spots Van Helsing on top of the cathedral and holds him accountable for Dr. Jekyll's death.
** The novelization of the film portrays Hyde as not only a murderer, but a [[Cannibalism|cannibal]] as well. The novel says the body of the murdered woman Van Helsing discovers on the streets of Paris as partially devoured while the same scene in the film shows the woman's body intact. However, the film does suggest that Hyde is cannibalistic when he encounters Van Helsing in Notre Dame and tells him "You're a big one. You'll be hard to digest." In the [[Van Helsing (video game)|Game Version]] Hyde tells Van Helsing that he is responsible for the murders and digestion of several people including children.

* The Ghost of Mr. Hyde made a cameo in ''[[Scooby-Doo! and the Goblin King]]'' as a patron in a monster bar.

* The Dynomutt version of Mr. Hyde appeared in ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mask of the Blue Falcon]]'', voiced by [[John DiMaggio]].

* [[Russell Crowe]] played Dr. Jekyll in ''[[The Mummy (2017 film)|The Mummy]]'', which is the first and only installment in [[Universal Pictures|Universal's]] [[Universal Classic Monsters|Dark Universe]] and is a role which would have been elaborated on in further films within the series. It is suggested that Jekyll's transformation into Hyde was a "natural" condition, as he reflects on how someone- implied to be him- realized that he was succumbing to evil but was able to find a cure as a physician, requiring regular injections of an unspecified compound to prevent himself becoming Hyde, an aggressive and sadistic persona. Despite the personality transformation, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde have the same appearance with the exception of their skin and eyes, although they also have a different palmprint with the result that palm scanners that will allow Jekyll access will prohibit Hyde from using the same door. As Hyde, he exhibits greater levels of physical strength, endurance and aggression as well as improved combat abilities.
* Henry Jekyll, better known as Edward "Eddy" Hyde was mentioned many times in the [[Monster High: The Movie|2022 live action film on Monster High]]. He had a son named Edward "Eddy" Hyde Jr. who went under the alias Mr. Komos.

===Comics===
* In ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume One]]'' and [[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume II|''Volume Two'']] by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]], Henry Jekyll is a scientist who is the lesser half of Edward Hyde and member of the Victorian League. This incarnation of Jekyll and Hyde reveals that eventually Jekyll found that he would transform into Hyde under stress, not unlike [[Hulk]]. Likewise, Hyde has become progressively taller and bulkier than Jekyll, while Jekyll has become shorter and withered. During a dinner scene, Hyde explains that this is because splitting himself and Jekyll into separate identities resulted in him losing his restraints and growing beyond his original limits, while Jekyll withered away without anything to drive him. During the [[Martian (The War of the Worlds)|Martian]] invasion, he developed a strong respect for Mina Murray and sacrificed himself to stop Martian [[Tripod (The War of the Worlds)|tripods]] from crossing [[London Bridge]]. His self-sacrifice was honored in having Serpentine Park named into [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] and a statue of Mr. Hyde is seen in the park in ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier]]'' and throughout ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume III: Century]]''.

* The [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Hulk]] is loosely based on Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein's Monster]]. The supervillain [[Mister Hyde (Marvel Comics)|Mister Hyde]] is more directly inspired by Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

* The [[DC Comics]] supervillain [[Two-Face]] was inspired by Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde due to their split personality.

*[[Satanik]], an Italian noir comic book created in December 1964: Marny Bannister, a female chemistry scientist whose face is marked by an [[angioma]], develops a drug which transforms her into a fascinating woman. The drug has an unexpected side effect, making her a criminal mastermind.

===Stage===
The story was adapted into a stage musical simply titled ''[[Jekyll & Hyde (musical)|Jekyll & Hyde]]'', with music by [[Frank Wildhorn]] and book by [[Leslie Bricusse]]. It premiered on May 24, 1990 at the Alley Theatre in Houston, Texas, with [[Chuck Wagner]] playing the title role(s) and Linda Eder as Lucy Harris. The stage version includes several character changes: Jekyll believes the evil in man is the reason for his father's mental deficiencies and is the driving force of his work; he is also engaged to Sir Danvers' daughter, Emma, while her former lover, Simon Stride, is still longing for her affections. The musical also features a prostitute named Lucy Harris, who is the object of Hyde's lust.

===Miscellaneous===
* The [[Lego Minifigures (theme)|Lego Minifigures]] theme has a character in Series 9 named Mr. Good and Evil, who is based on Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

* In ''[[Monster High]]'', there are characters named Jackson Jekyll and Holt Hyde who are the descendants of Dr. Jekyll. They are voiced by [[Cindy Robinson]] in the webisodes and TV specials.

* In ''[[Servamp]]'', a manga written and illustrated by Strike Tanaka, there are two characters known as Licht Jekylland Todoroki and Lawless of Greed (later given the name of Hyde by the former). They have no direct correlation with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in personality traits from the original novel, but their names, as well as their roles as opposites to each other (Licht as an Angel and Hyde as a Demon) nod to the original story. Their combined special attack is titled "Jekyll and Hyde".

* In ''[[Fate/Grand Order]]'', a mobile video game based on the ''[[Fate/stay night]]'' visual novel and franchise from [[Type-Moon]], a Servant under the classes Assassin and Berserker appears, named "Henry Jekyll & Hyde." In most of his appearance during battle sequences, he is the Assassin-class Servant Henry Jekyll, however when using his Noble Phantasm, or special ability, he becomes the Berserker-class Servant Hyde.

* In the BBC radio sketch show ''[[John Finnemore's Souvenir Programme]]'', one sketch depicts the relationship between Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (played by [[John Finnemore]] and [[Simon Kane (writer)|Simon Kane]] respectively) as that of aggrieved [[roommate|flatmates]]. They enter into a tit-for-tat exchange which ends in begrudging compromise after Jekyll threatens to get a [[vasectomy]].

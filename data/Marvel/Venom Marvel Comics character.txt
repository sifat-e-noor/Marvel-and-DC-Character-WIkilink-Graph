'''Venom''' is a [[Character (arts)|character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is a sentient alien [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] with an amorphous, liquid-like form, who survives by bonding with a host, usually human. This dual-life form receives enhanced powers and usually refers to itself as "Venom". The symbiote was originally introduced as a living alien costume in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #252 (May 1984), with a full first appearance as Venom in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #300 (May 1988).

The Venom symbiote's first human host was [[Spider-Man]] himself, who eventually discovered its true nefarious nature and separated himself from the creature in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #258 (November 1984)<ref name=Amazing258>{{cite comic |writer=[[Tom DeFalco]] |penciller=[[Ron Frenz]] |inker=[[Josef Rubinstein]] |story=The Sinister Secret of Spider-Man's New Costume |title=[[The Amazing Spider-Man]] |volume= |issue=258 |date=November 1984 |publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>—with a brief rejoining five months later in ''[[Web of Spider-Man]]'' #1.<ref name=Web1>{{cite comic |story=Til Death Do Us Part! |title=[[Web of Spider-Man]] |writer=[[Simonson, Louise]] |penciller=LaRocque, Greg |inker=Mooney, Jim |publisher=Marvel Comics |volume=1 | issue= #1 |date=April 1985}}</ref> The symbiote went on to merge with other hosts, beginning with '''[[Eddie Brock]]''', its second and best-known host, with whom it first became Venom. Venom has endured as one of Spider-Man's most prominent villains, and was initially regarded as one of his three [[Archenemy|archenemies]], alongside the [[Norman Osborn|Green Goblin]] and [[Doctor Octopus]]. Since his debut however, Venom has evolved into an [[antihero]]ic figure, slowly distancing himself from his initial goal to ruin Spider-Man's life to try and do good instead, even putting aside his differences with and helping Spider-Man at times. After Brock, numerous other hosts for Venom followed; some of the most notable are the villain '''[[Mac Gargan]]''', who was the main incarnation of Venom from 2005 to 2009, and '''[[Flash Thompson]]''', who became the superhero '''Agent Venom''' from 2011 to 2016, before Venom returned to Brock in 2017. Venom's most recent and current host is Brock's biological son, '''Dylan.''' Venom is also depicted as having spawned several children—[[Scream (comics)|Scream]], [[Lasher (comics)|Lasher]], [[Phage (comics)|Phage]], [[Agony (comics)|Agony]], [[Riot (comics)|Riot]], [[Mania (character)|Mania]], [[Sleeper (symbiote)|Sleeper]], and most notably, [[Carnage (character)|Carnage]], who becomes Venom's [[archenemy]] after being bound to [[serial killer]] [[Cletus Kasady]].

A fan-favorite character and well-known figure in [[popular culture]], Venom (primarily the Eddie Brock incarnation) has been featured in various media adaptations of ''Spider-Man'' over the years, including [[feature films]], [[television series]] and [[video games]]. The [[Venom (Spider-Man 3)|character]] was portrayed by [[Tobey Maguire]] and [[Topher Grace]] in ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' (2007), with [[Tom Hardy]] primarily portraying [[Venom (Sony's Spider-Man Universe)|the character]] in the [[Sony's Spider-Man Universe]] films ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]'' (2018) and ''[[Venom: Let There Be Carnage]]'' (2021), as well as an uncredited post-credit scene appearance in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]'' (2021).

The Eddie Brock incarnation of Venom is among Spider-Man's most famous rogues, and is regarded by many as a dark reflection of the hero. Comics journalist and historian [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] writes of the character: "What started out as a replacement costume for Spider-Man turned into one of the Marvel web-slinger's greatest nightmares".<ref>[[Mike Conroy (writer)|Conroy, Mike]].

==Conception and creation==
The original idea of a new costume for Spider-Man that would later become the character Venom was conceived by a Marvel Comics reader from [[Norridge, Illinois]] named Randy Schueller.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Cronin, Brian|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/05/16/randy-schuellers-brush-with-comic-history/|title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed Extra: Randy Schueller's Brush With Comic History &#124|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=May 16, 2007|access-date=December 30, 2009|archive-date=October 23, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023055636/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/05/16/randy-schuellers-brush-with-comic-history/|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1982, [[Jim Shooter]], Marvel's editor-in-chief at the time, sent Schueller a letter acknowledging Marvel's interest in the idea, which they ended up purchasing from him for $220.<ref>[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/Spidey_005.JPG August 3, 1982 letter from Jim Shooter to Randy Schueller] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151104171743/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/Spidey_005.JPG |date=November 4, 2015 }}. Comic Book Resources. Retrieved November 21, 2011</ref> Shooter came up with the idea of switching Spider-Man to a black-and-white costume, possibly influenced by the intended costume design for the new [[Spider-Woman (Julia Carpenter)|Spider-Woman]]; artist [[Mike Zeck]] designed it.<ref name="PeterDavid">[[David, Peter]] (June 4, 1993).

Writer/artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] says on his website that he conceived a costume of self-healing biological material when he was the artist on ''[[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] —'' to explain how that character's costume was constantly being torn and then apparently repaired by the next issue. Byrne says explaining that he ended up not using the idea on that title, but that [[Roger Stern]] later asked him if he could use the idea for Spider-Man's alien costume. Stern in turn plotted the issue in which the costume first appeared but then left the title. It was writer [[Tom DeFalco]] and artist [[Ron Frenz]] who established that the costume was a sentient alien being that was vulnerable to high sonic energy during their run on ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' that preceded Michelinie's.<ref>[[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]].

With the nature of the symbiote established Michelenie felt it could serve a character concept he had been toying with for sometime. When Michelinie first began working on Spider-Man stories he noted that the most unique ability Spider-Man possessed as a superhero was his spider sense, which Michelinie claimed gave the character a level of invulnerability on par or better than much stronger Marvel superheroes. While other Spider-Man antagonists such as [[Norman Osborn|The Green Goblin]] and [[Mysterio]] had been able to temporarily disable Spider-Man's spider sense through chemical means, Michelinie was fascinated by the idea of a villain who could permanently evade Spider-Man's spider sense and what kind of consequences that would have on both Spider-Man as a superhero and Peter Parker's personal life. After initially coming up with characters who were able to evade Spider-Man's spider sense through cybernetic means that were rejected by Marvel editors, Michelinie posited that the symbiote would make a human host be able to evade Spider-Man's spider sense through it being mutated by absorbing Spider-Man's genetic material when Spider-Man was its host. This idea was approved by Marvel editors and Michelinie was given the green light to further refine the character.<ref name="ComicPop">{{cite web |author=Big Shots |title=David Michelinie |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sBuFsRrLco&t=1252s  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201119022033/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sBuFsRrLco |archive-date=2020-11-19 |url-status=dead|via=YouTube |publisher=ComicPop |access-date=5 January 2020}}</ref>

The symbiote was first introduced as Spider-Man's new black costume in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #252 (May 1984) as part of a story called "Homecoming!" The story takes place after Spider-Man's return from the events of the miniseries ''[[Secret Wars]]'', where he first obtains the black costume. The full first appearance of Venom is in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #300 (May 1988), after the symbiote bonds with Eddie Brock.

The story of how '''Spider-Man''' gets his new black costume is recounted in ''[[Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars]]'' #8 (December 1984), in which writer Jim Shooter and artist Mike Zeck depicted the heroes and villains of the Marvel Universe transported to another planet called Battleworld by a being called the [[Beyonder]]. After Spider-Man's costume is ruined from battles with the villains, he is directed by Thor and the Hulk to a room at the heroes' base where they inform him a machine can read his thoughts and instantly fabricate any type of clothing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2019/08/03/absolute-carnage-deadpool-secret-wars-1-canon/|title=Will Absolute Carnage Make Deadpool's Secret Secret Wars #1 Canon?

To Spider-Man's surprise, the costume can mimic street clothes and provides a seemingly inexhaustible and stronger supply of webbing.<ref>{{cite comic|story=Invasion!|title=[[Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars]]|issue= #1|writer=[[Shooter, Jim]]|penciller=[[Zeck, Mike]]|inker=[[Beatty, John]]; [[Abel, Jack]]; [[Esposito, Mike]]|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=December 1984}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/comicstories.687 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091004145420/http://marvel.com/news/comicstories.687 |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 4, 2009 |title=Venom: The Sordid History of Spider-Man's Black Costume |publisher=Marvel Comics |date=November 29, 2006 |access-date=2010-04-27 }}</ref>

During their run on ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', writer Tom DeFalco and artist Ron Frenz established that the costume was a sentient alien symbiote that was vulnerable to both fire and high sonic energy. It was in that storyline that the costume would envelop Peter Parker while he slept, and go out at night to fight crime, leaving Parker inexplicably exhausted in the morning. Parker had the costume examined by [[Reed Richards]], who discovered that it was alive, and when Parker realized it was trying to permanently bond to Parker's body, he rejected it, and it was subsequently contained by the Fantastic Four.<ref name=Amazing258/><ref>[[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]].

In ''[[Go Down Swinging (comic book)|Go Down Swinging]]'', when [[Norman Osborn]] got bonded to the Carnage symbiote, Spider-Man rebonds to the symbiote in an attempt to stop Osborn, now calling himself ''Red Goblin'', while forgiving both Eddie and Venom for the past conflicts. He with the symbiote got a new costume design and they were overpowering Osborn until Norman mortally injured Flash Thompson. This caused Spider-Man and the symbiote to get angry, eventually losing control until Flash calmed them down with his dying breath. In the final battle, Spider-Man tells the symbiote to leave him and that he himself is going to be all right while Norman also detaches himself from Carnage.<ref name="ASM800">{{cite comic|title=The Amazing Spider-Man|issue= #800|volume=1|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=May 30, 2018|story=Chapter Four: The Goblin Triumphant|writer=[[Dan Slott]]|penciller=[[Stuart Immonen]]|inker=[[Wade von Grawbadger]]|letterer=Joe Caramagna|colorist=[[Marte Gracia]]|editor=[[Nick Lowe (comics)|Nick Lowe]], Devin Lewis, Kathleen Wisneski}}</ref>

===Eddie Brock===
{{Main|Eddie Brock}}
[[David Michelinie]] would later write the backstory of '''Eddie Brock''' as the alien's new host that would become the villain Venom, using the events of [[Peter David]]'s 1985 "[[Sin-Eater (comics)|Sin Eater]]" storyline in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' as a basis for Brock's origin.<ref name="PeterDavid" /> Venom's existence was first indicated in ''[[Web of Spider-Man]]'' #18 (September 1986), when he shoved [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] in front of a subway train without Parker's [[spider-sense]] warning him, though only Brock's hand was seen on-panel. The next indication of Venom's existence was in ''Web of Spider-Man'' #24 (March 1987), when Parker climbed out of a high story window to change into Spider-Man, but found a black arm coming through the window and grabbing him, again without being warned by his spider-sense. After appearing in shadow in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #298 (March 1988), Venom made his cameo appearance on the last page of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #299 (April 1988), when he terrorized Parker's wife, [[Mary Jane Watson]], and made his full appearance in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #300 (May 1988).<ref name="ComicsPriceGuide">[http://comicspriceguide.com/collection/marvel/amazing-spider-man/300/xbvwh], "The Amazing Spider-man #300", Comics Price Guide, accessed March 3, 2015.</ref>

Spider-Man confronted him in the following issue, when Brock reveals that he was a ''Daily Globe'' reporter who worked on the Sin-Eater case, and that his career was ruined when it was discovered that the man Brock announced as the Sin-Eater was a compulsive confessor. Forced to eke out a living writing lurid stories for venomous tabloids, Brock blamed Spider-Man for his predicament. He took up bodybuilding to reduce stress. It failed to do so, and Brock sank into a suicidal depression. Seeking solace at the church where Spider-Man repelled the symbiote, the symbiote—sensing Brock's hatred for Spider-Man—bonded with the disgraced reporter. Brock took on the name Venom in reference to the sensationalistic material he was forced to traffic in following his fall from grace.<ref name=ASM300>{{cite comic|writer=[[David Michelinie]]|artist=[[Todd McFarlane]]|story=Venom|title=The Amazing Spider-Man|issue= #300|date=May 1988|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marvel.com/universe/Venom |title=(Eddie Brock) – Marvel Universe: The definitive online source for Marvel super hero bios |publisher=Marvel.com |date=2009-09-15 |access-date=2010-04-27}}</ref>

Over the years, as the symbiote gained more intelligence and moved to additional human hosts, the name began to apply to the symbiote as well as its hosts. As Venom, Brock fights Spider-Man many times, winning on several occasions. Venom repeatedly tries to kill Peter Parker/[[Spider-Man]]—both when the latter was in and out of costume. Thus Parker is forced to abandon his "black costume", which the symbiote had been mimicking, after Venom confronts Parker's wife [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]].<ref>{{cite comic|writer=David Michelenie|artist=Todd McFarlane|story=Survival of the Hittist|title=The Amazing Spider-Man|issue= #299|date=April 1988|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>

As well as helping Eddie Brock to seek continued revenge against Spider-Man, the symbiote also aids Brock in a sporadic career as a vigilante. He and the symbiote occasionally share a desire to protect innocent people from harm, even if it means working side by side with the hated Spider-Man. This is especially true when Venom combats the entity he believes to be his spawn, Carnage. When Spider-Man helps Venom save Brock's ex-wife Anne Weying, the two form a temporary truce, though this falls apart after Weying's suicide.<ref name=ASM375>{{cite comic|writer=David Michelinie|penciller=Mark Bagley|inker=Randy Emberlin|story=Spidey Vs.

''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Spider-Man''. 2004</ref> Eventually, Eddie Brock and the symbiote go their separate ways as the symbiote grows tired of having a diseased host and Eddie rejects its growing bloodlust, leading him to sell the symbiote at a super villain auction.

The creature that would become Venom was born in the 998th generation<ref>''Venom vs Carnage'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> to a race of extraterrestrial [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]]s, which lived by possessing the bodies of other life-forms. The parasites would endow their victims with enhanced physical abilities, at the cost of fatally draining them of adrenaline.{{issue|date=May 2014}} According to the 1995 "[[Planet of the Symbiotes|Planet of the symbiotes]]" storyline, the Venom symbiote, after separated from its first host, was deemed insane by its own race after it was discovered that it desired to commit to its host rather than use it up. The symbiote was then imprisoned on [[Battleworld]] to ensure it did not pollute the species' gene pool.{{issue|date=May 2014}}

The symbiote bonds with its new host, Lee Price, launching volume 3 of the ''Venom'' comic book series. The series ran for six issues total (Nov. 2016 – April 2017). Eddie Brock is able to regain the Venom symbiote at the conclusion of the series, returning the ''Venom'' comic book title to volume 1 with issue #150.<ref name="auto">''Venom'' vol. 3 #6.

Gargan later became a member of a sub-group of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]],<ref>{{cite comic|writer=Mark Millar|penciller=[[Steve McNiven]]|inker=[[Dexter Vines]]|story=Civil War, Part Four of Seven|title=[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]|issue= #4|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=October 2006}}</ref> which was drafted<ref>{{cite comic|editor=[[Tom Brevoort]], Molly Lazer and [[Joe Quesada]]|artist=[[Leinil Francis Yu]]|title=Civil War: Choosing Sides|issue= #1|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=December 2006}}</ref> by the Avengers to hunt down the members of the fugitive New Avengers. It was then revealed that he had been outfitted with electrical implants by the government to keep the symbiote in check.<ref>''Heroes for Hire vol. 2'' #2</ref>

When in the Venom persona, Gargan retained very little of his original personality and was controlled almost completely by the symbiote, which drove him to cannibalism. When the symbiote was dormant in his body, he expressed nausea and fear of the organism.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Warren Ellis]]|artist=[[Mike Deodato]]|title=[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]|issue= #112|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=May 2007}}</ref> During a fight with "[[Anti-Venom (comics)|Anti-Venom]]" (Eddie Brock), he and his symbiote were separated, and the Venom symbiote was nearly destroyed. Blobs of it still existed in his bloodstream, however, so Osborn injected Gargan with a vaccine for Anti-Venom's healing powers, which restored the symbiote by causing the remaining pieces of it to expand rapidly.

After being separated from Flash Thompson through unspecified means, the Venom symbiote happens upon a black market deal between [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]]'s gang and [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]]'s gang. He resorts to bonding with one of the men present, a discharged Army Ranger named Lee Price who was with Scorpion as part of Black Cat's gang. The weakened symbiote pleads with Price, attempting to convince him to become a hero like Thompson. Price ignores and overpowers it, intent on using it for personal gain as a new, wholly villainous Venom.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Mike Costa|penciller = Gerardo Sandoval|inker = Gerardo Sandoval|colorist = Dono Sanchez Almara|letterer = VC's Clayton Cowles|editor = Devin Lewis|title = Venom|volume = 3|issue = #1|date = 23 November 2016|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

Lee Price makes his way to Black Cat's hideout where Scorpion accuses him of botching the black market sale by causing the shoot-out. After having to keep the Venom symbiote from attacking Black Cat, Lee Price takes his leave from Black Cat's lair as Scorpion gets suspicious towards Lee. His departure is seen by some FBI Agents. Lee Price later gets attacked by Tombstone's minion Firebug. Upon defeating Firebug, an FBI Agent with a bazooka appears telling Lee Price that he is under arrest.<ref>''Venom'' vol. 3 #2</ref>

Lee Price eventually loses the symbiote when Eddie Brock and Spider-Man take him down and he is arrested by the NYPD.<ref name="auto"/>

While incarcerated at the New York Corrections Supermax Facility for Superhuman Incarceration, Lee Price is feared by most of the inmates and he even defeats three inmates in the prison's cafeteria when they try to kill him to boost their reputation. Lee swears to get out, reclaim the Venom symbiote, and plan revenge on those who have wronged him.<ref>''Venom'' #155</ref> Lee Price is later visited by his [[lawyer]] who tells him that two of the inmates he defeated had died in the infirmary and that Venom has resurfaced upon it being revealed in the news.<ref>''Venom'' #157</ref> At the courthouse, Lee Price's lawyer stated that Lee's actions as Venom were caused by the Venom symbiote while the opposing lawyer mentions about Venom still being at large. The judge then asked for some evidence to help with the trial. After the trial, Lee Price is released from prison and begins his plans to reclaim the Venom symbiote and take revenge on those who have wronged him.<ref>''Venom'' #158</ref>

Tel-Kar's body is biologically altered so he can have full control over the symbiote's mind to the point of erasing its memories. He successfully infiltrated the Skrull army discovering various secrets. However he blew his cover up in order to save some Kree refugees and handed the symbiote to them to return it to Hala. Then Tel-Kar was betrayed by [[Ronan the Accuser]] who used a [[Sentry (Kree)|Kree Sentry]] to capture Tel-Kar and was given to the Skrulls as a war criminal. Separated from Tel-Kar after his capture, the symbiote goes on to be bonded to Spider-Man.<ref>''Venom First Host #1''. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Spider-Man Annual #1''. Marvel Comics. (2018)</ref>

Tel-Kar escapes the Skrulls and wanders through the Galaxy thinking that the War is still going on, until he hears of an agent from Earth called [[Flash Thompson]] with a black symbiote suit. Recognizing it as his symbiote, he goes to Earth to find it. Eddie Brock arrives with the symbiote and saves Tel-Kar from the Warbride Skrull M'Lanz, who had followed him. Angered by Venom's refusal to return to him, Tel-Kar threatens to bond to Venom's latest offspring and turn it into a monster. Acceding to Tel-Kar, Venom reunites with him and they go to a Skrull research base to get a Skrull bioweapon. Simultaneously, Eddie is bonded to the offspring calling itself '''Sleeper''' and allies with M'Lanz to stop Tel-Kar. During the ensuing battle, Tel-Kar concludes that he does not need Venom anymore and uses an electrified spear to detach himself from it while scarring himself in the process. Later he is betrayed by the Kree Empire while Eddie escapes with Venom and M'Lanz with Sleeper. Tel-Kar, now furious, attempts to release the bioweapon on Earth to kill all humanity, but Sleeper bonds to Tel-Kar and lobotomizes him as punishment for what he did to Venom and Eddie. Sleeper, now with Tel-Kar's body, wishes Eddie farewell and goes on to explore the universe.<ref>''Venom First Host''. #5 Marvel Comics.</ref>

He then went after Spider-Man in order to steal the suit and use it for himself.<ref>''Symbiote Spider-Man'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==

Though it requires a living host to survive, the Venom symbiote is adept at fending for itself independent of a host. The symbiote is capable of shapeshifting abilities, including the ability to form spikes or expand its size,<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Daniel Way]]|penciller=Francisco Herrera|inker=Carlos Lobo Cuevas|title=Venom|story=Patterns. Part 2|issue= #12|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=2003}}</ref> as well as mimic the appearance of other humanoids after it has obtained a host. The organism can additionally use its shape-shifting abilities to conceal itself by altering its coloration or by becoming completely invisible. It also contains a small "[[Hammerspace|dimensional aperture]]", allowing its hosts to carry items without adding mass to the costume. The symbiote also exhibits telepathic abilities, primarily when it needs to communicate with its host.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Because of its contact with Spider-Man, the symbiote grants all of its subsequent hosts that hero's powers and cannot be detected by his spider-sense. As Spider-Man's fighting style is partly dependent on his spider-sense, his effectiveness was somewhat hampered when he battled Eddie Brock. Retaining its memory from the time it was bonded with Spider-Man, Venom is also capable of producing webbing similar to Spider-Man's variety created from its biomass.<ref name=ASM300/>

The symbiote greatly enhances the physical strength of those it bonds with. Its hosts experience a vastly larger size and musculature. The symbiote displays non-human teeth, which are very sharp, and commonly protrude a long, prehensile tongue from its mouth. Venom is depicted as being physically much bigger than Spider-Man, as well as having more brute strength.

Venom exhibits some immunities to the supernatural powers of others such as the Penance Stare of [[Ghost Rider]] or Spider-Man's extrasensory spider-sense.

Some incarnations of the Venom symbiote have shown it able to replicate itself. This ability is shown in the 2005–2006 miniseries ''[[Spider-Man: Reign]]'' when Venom recreates his symbiote to combat his loneliness.

The Venom symbiote is vulnerable to fire and sonic waves, causing it great pain and exhaustion if it sustains enough exposure. It can sense and track all of its offspring symbiotes except [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]], who learned how to block this ability shortly after bonding with Cletus Kasady and confronting Venom/Eddie Brock for the first time.<ref name=ASM361-363/>

The Venom symbiote is shown to form giant web-like dragon wings when it was in contact with [[Knull (comics)|Knull]].

==Other versions==
===Prime Earth (Earth-616)===

===== Publication history =====
Mayhem first appeared in ''Amazing Spider-Girl'' #20 and subsequently appeared in ''Spectacular Spider-Girl'', with her final appearance being in ''Spider-Girl: The End''.

===== Fictional character biography =====
It is revealed that, while still bonded to [[Eddie Brock]], some of the symbiote's genetic material had been taken by [[Alternative versions of Green Goblin#MC2|Norman Osborn]] and combined with a clone of [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|May]] to make a Human/Symbiote hybrid.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Girl'' #20</ref> She was discovered by [[Normie Osborn]], who revealed to [[Peter Parker]] that the clone may be the original Mayday Parker, as Norman had written letters hinting to this fact. After a failed attempt to get the answers from [[Fury The Goblin Queen|Élan DeJunae]], Normie was attacked by the hybrid who managed to escape. She then stalks the original May to her school in order to replace her, starting the [[Clone Saga]]. She accidentally threw herself down the school stairwell, allowing the familiar May to escape by leaping off the building.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Girl'' #25. Marvel Comics.</ref> May changed into Spider-Girl, but New May on her way to assist the [[X-People]] in containing Sara Hingle's powers. The hybrid intercepted May on her way and tried to tackle her. May saved them both from falling to the street, and, after a brief fight May saved her double again and, proving a major difference between the two Mays as Spider-Girl does not kill her enemies, but the hybrid was more ruthless. When arguing about who the real May, [[Kaine Parker#MC2|Kaine]] comments "Are you saying clones aren't real?"<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Girl'' #27. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After being "absorbed" into the aged Peter Parker, the original Green Goblin—Norman Osborn takes over Peter's mind, but, in an attempt to become invincible, Osborn combines himself with the Hybrid, Spider-Man, and accidentally Spider-Girl, when she dives in to save her father.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Girl'' #29. Marvel Comics.</ref> After Osborn makes Spider-Man view his worst moments, Spider-Girl's memory overrides Osborn's power, and she was able to convince the Hybrid to fight Osborn together, and so force everyone out of Peter's body; destroying Osborn in the process.

After that, May proposed to the hybrid to join the Parker Family as May always wanted to have a sister, despite Peter being against the idea. The hybrid named herself "April Parker" and went on to live with the real Spider-Girl's family (her [[Benjamin Richard Parker|baby brother]], Mary Jane, and Peter) and starts to go school where she befriends May's friends especially Gene Thompson, [[Flash Thompson#MC2|Flash Thompson]]'s son.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Girl'' #10–11. Marvel Comics.</ref> She becomes a partner to Spider-Girl and helps her fight crime and even saves Peter from the Goblin Queen with the help of [[Phil Urich]].

Despite trying to a hero, she was more ruthless than May as seen when she killed [[Roderick Kingsley#MC2|Hobgoblin]],<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Girl'' vol. 2 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Tombstone (comics)#MC2|Tombstone]]<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Girl'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> and nearly killing [[Black Tarantula]], due for being hired to do so.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Girl'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In a later timeline, Mayhem feeling jealousy towards May, she tries to make her accept that she was the clone and start fighting, however she accidentally kills the real Spider-Girl. Feeling guilty for what she has done she impersonates May and became a murderous vigilante, eventually killing the hero [[American Dream (comics)|American Dream]]. In an attempt to stop her, the military used pieces of the dead [[Carnage (comics)#MC2|Carnage]] symbiote to create the Bio-Predators. However the Biopreds take over their hosts and start killing and bonding to thousands of humans around the world, decimating the world and its defenders. Mayhem, seeing the error of her ways, with the help of [[Cassie Lang]] goes back in time using Doctor Doom's time machine. However, she materialized inside a wall. She implanted her memories into her younger self, before dying and the present April sacrifices herself to save Spider-Girl, ensuring the events that led to the Biopreds' creation never occurred. She is presumed dead, but Peter assures May that clones always come back.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Girl: The End''</ref>

===== Powers and abilities =====
{{Main|Symbiote (comics)#Biology|Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)#Powers and abilities}}
Due to being a Symbiote/Human hybrid and clone of Mayday Parker, she has all the powers of her predecessors, Venom and Spider-Girl. However, due to her half-symbiote nature, she is also immune to the symbiotes' classic weaknesses.<ref>''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==== Other versions ====
In a reality imagined by Phil Urich where Spider-Girl did not exist, the Venom symbiote fully bonded to Peter, permanently becoming Spider-Venom.<ref>''Spider-Girl'' #26. Marvel Comics</ref> This versions would later appear along with the Spider-Army during ''[[Spider-Verse]]''.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #9. Marvel Comics</ref>

=== Mangaverse ===
In the [[Marvel Mangaverse]] continuity, Venom is a normal man, the son of [[Aunt May|May]] and her first husband, Shinji, and a former member of the Spider-Clan. Venom's skin is black due to the poisoned arrows throwed by the Shadow-Clan, which killed his father. His spider symbol is white, and also much larger than [[Spider-Man (Marvel Mangaverse)|Spider-Man]]'s.<ref>''Spider-Man: Legend of the Spider-Clan'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Venom is responsible for the murder of most of Spider-Clan and Peter's Uncle Ben, Venom's stepfather in the Mangaverse, at the command of New York's [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin of Crime]]. Peter defeats him and spares his life. Venom later [[Usurper|usurps]] Kingpin for control over New York's ninja criminal gangs.<ref>''Marvel Mangaverse: Spider-Man'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Separately, the Venom symbiote appears as a black liquid that is released from a cursed [[amulet]], which was given to Peter by [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)#Marvel Mangaverse|Black Cat]]. The symbiote draws energy from the amulet's wearer, which can be fatal after prolonged exposure. The wearer's strength and agility are increased, and his or her ability to control their own violent urges is reduced. When Peter Parker becomes possessed by the evil amulet, removing it leaves him near death.<ref>''Spider-Man: Legend of the Spider-Clan'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Venom captures the amulet and chooses to sacrifice his own life to force it to save Peter, repaying the debt he owes for Peter sparing his life. This act revitalizes Peter, but leaves Venom nothing but a skeleton. The amulet, containing Venom's life force, is used to heal the crippled Kingpin.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

In the ''Legend of the Spider-Clan'' one-shot story ''Elemental Evil'', Venom inexplicably reappears in the mountain-top home of the Spider-Clan, alive and whole, his skin now a dark blue. He also gained new powers, including a pair of vicious jaws and a long drooling tongue, bringing him closer in appearance to his [[Earth-616]] counterpart. Despite their history, Peter agrees that Venom will teach the ways of the Spider-Clan and the use of his powers to Peter. Venom and the rest of the new Spider-Clan aid in training Peter to become more powerful, tapping into the mystical side of his spider abilities. In the end, Peter discovers that the group is run by Peter's biological mother, who ordered the death of [[Aunt May]] to rid him of emotional attachments. As a result, Peter refuses to take his place as leader, rejecting the clan. Venom is awarded with rulership over the Spider-Clan. No reason is given for Venom's resurrection or his new powers, but when asked about it, Venom only said "I was lucky".{{issue|date=February 2013}}

During the "[[Spider-Verse]]" event, Venom becomes aware about conflict between [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man|various Spider-Man]] and the [[Inheritors (comics)|Inheritors]] and fearing that the presence of Peter in the temple will attract the conflict to the clan, he tries to stop Peter and willing to kill him, but only to be stopped by the Spider-Army.<ref>''Spider-Verse'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==== Other versions ====
An alternate version of Venom appears in ''[[Spider-Man Family]] Featuring Spider-Clan'' #1, where he and Peter's mother Kiri are the leaders of the Spider-Clan, which consist of [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman/Earth]], [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern/Fire]], a female [[Hydro-Man]]/Water, an old man version of [[Cyclone (Marvel Comics)|Cyclone]]/Wind, [[Green Goblin]], [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]], [[Kraven the Hunter|Kraven]], [[Rhino (Marvel Comics)|Rhino]], [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]] and [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]].<ref>''Spider-Man Family Featuring Spider-Clan'' #1.

=== Marvel 2099 ===
[[File:Venom 2099.jpg|thumb|upright|Kron Stone as Venom 2099]]
[[File:Alea Bell (Earth-TRN767) from Venom 2099 Vol 1 1 001.jpg|thumb|upright|Alea Bell as Venom 2099]]
'''[[Kron Stone]]''' is the older half-brother of [[Spider-Man 2099]] (Miguel O'Hara), having the same father: [[Tyler Stone (Marvel Comics)|Tyler Stone]]. As a child, Kron was continually abused by the android housekeeper which mistook him for a dog, and as a result he later became a bully, taking enjoyment in other people's pain. The relationship between the two brothers is so conflicted that Miguel tried to kill Kron at one point. In his introduction, Stone ordered [[Punisher 2099|Jake Gallows]]' family to be killed. Gallows found Stone and fatally wounded him with a knife as revenge, before dumping his body into the sewer.<ref>''Punisher 2099'' #2</ref> As Kron laid dying in the sewer, his body brushed up against a black ball. The ball then bonded to him and formed a new Venom. The symbiote was described as having mutated over the years, and displayed new abilities in this timeline, including acidic blood and saliva.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' #35. Marvel Comics.</ref> With this new power, Stone sought to emotionally torture Miguel—whom Kron never discovered was his half-brother—by hurting those close to him, going so far as to kill Miguel's former love Dana—who was also Tyler's lover. After a fight between Spider-Man and Venom, the former emerged as the victor, using loud speakers to neutralize Venom, who was subsequently taken to the lab for study. It was revealed that the symbiote bonded with Kron on a molecular level, giving Kron an amorphous physiology that allowed his body to take on the properties of the symbiote itself.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' #37. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, after the symbiote was separated from Kron, it merged with Roman the Sub-Mariner, the son of [[Namor]], who fled to the ocean and is never seen again.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' #38</ref> It was later shown that part of the symbiote is at the [[Alchemax]] lab for studying.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' #44</ref>

A new Venon 2009, '''Alea Bell''', was introduced in a similarly named one-shot published in 2019.<ref>''Venom 2099'' #1</ref> When she was a child, her left arm was badly burned in a crash that also resulted in the death of her mother. Raised by her father, Theo, Alea was bullied at school over her scars. She was then selected to undergo an experimental treatment being developed by Alchemax scientist Dr. Russell. She regained consciousness to find that the treatment had worked and her arm was restored. During a confrontation the next day with a girl at school, a black tendril emerged from her hand and sliced through the Alchemax monitoring bracelet. Alea heard a sinister voice in her head, her left arm transforming into a jet-black limb tipped with razor-sharp claws. Returning home, Alea learned that the purported panacea she had been treated with was a piece of a symbiote called Venom, and that Alchemax intended to turn her into a [[supersoldier]] using it. Empathizing with its pain, felt, Alea reluctantly agreed to the symbiote's request to be made whole in exchange for her getting her normal life back. Infiltrating Alchemax, Alea was accosted by a pair of guards and was horrified when the symbiote killed them to protect her. As the symbiote scolded her innocent naivety, Alea protested that she did not want to be seen as a monster. Arriving at the lab containing the other pieces of the symbiote, Alea shut down the containment grid, but was knocked unconscious by Dr. Russell. The Venom symbiote, reclaiming its disparate pieces, bonded to Alea, transformed her into Venom and had eaten Dr. Russell as revenge for cutting it apart. Disgusted, Alea reiterated that she did not want to become a monster and asked if they could be a hero instead; the Venom symbiote begrudgingly agreeing to her request. At school the following day, Alea transformed into Venom to terrify her bully. However, the symbiote was abruptly overcome by the will of a dark god. Alarmed, Alea asked the Venom symbiote what had happened and it told her that the god of its species, [[Knull (character)|Knull]], was somehow still alive and on Earth.

* [[Timestorm 2009–2099]]'s version of [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]] is [[Kron Stone]].<ref>''Timestorm 2009–2099'' #1</ref>

===''Marvel Adventures''===
In this reality, after [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] removed the symbiote from Spider-Man, [[Human Torch|'''Johnny Storm''']] briefly bonded with it, believing it to be a technological suit like Spider-Man originally thought. After Johnny flamed on, the symbiote left his body in pain.

===''Marvel Age''===
In the ''[[Marvel Age]]'' mini-series ''Spider-Man and Power Pack'' #3–4, a fashion designer down on his luck manages to acquire the Venom symbiote after it is blasted off of Eddie Brock by Spider-Man, and, thinking its morphic qualities are just something built into the suit and not a living biological function, clones it three times as a new women's dress line. At the debut fashion show for the line, Peter Parker is photographing with Mary Jane Watson wearing one of the dresses, unaware of its true nature.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

In the audience is the [[Power Pack]] in their civilian identities, invited by Peter as a thank you for their help in the previous two issues. When the symbiotes hear Peter's name, their genetic memory recognizes it and they turn Mary Jane and the other three models into She-Venoms, and attack. The Power Pack join Spider-Man in the battle, during which Spider-Man briefly corners the designer and gets the truth out of him about the clones. The symbiote clones are sheared from their unwilling hosts, three by a sonic boom produced by [[Julie Power]]/Lightspeed's superhuman speed, the other by an energy burst from [[Katie Power]]/Energizer. The battle is then won when [[Jack Power (Marvel Comics)|Jack Power]]/Mass Master uses the music booth to blast them all with high audio, crippling them long enough to be captured. During the battle, however, one symbiote clone manages to briefly make contact with Katie Power's alien-born costume, causing it to become "infected" by the Venom symbiote's evil and vengeful desires (the kids' costumes in this continuity are semi-biological themselves, a concept later reinforced during a later mini-series when one is seen to repair damage to itself on its own). This causes Katie's costume to take on a Venom-like appearance, with the only differences being it is obviously smaller and Katie's energy burst symbol takes the place of the spider symbol's main body, the spider legs remaining.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

The [[Kymellian]] costume-turned-symbiote completely takes control of the little girl at night, using her to team with the [[Sinister Six]] to capture Spider-Man, and then turn on the other members of Power Pack, Katie's own siblings, to take revenge on them for their part in the symbiote clones' defeat. In the final battle, Julie Power manages to find and free Spider-Man, and together they manage to get [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] to blast all the villains, including himself, with a large electrical discharge powerful enough to render them all unconscious and again shear the costume-turned-symbiote off of Katie, the discharge purging Katie's costume of the "infection" in the process, restoring it to normal.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

Before he died, Brock managed to sputter out that he and the symbiote are dying, to which the zombie Spider-Man states that Venom is breaking his cold, dead heart.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer=[[Robert Kirkman]]|Penciller=[[Sean Phillips]]|Inker=Sean Phillips|Story=''Marvel Zombies'' (Part Four)|Title=''[[Marvel Zombies]]''|Volume=1|Issue=#4|Date=May 2006|Publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

It was piloted by '''Addy Brock''' until a battle against the kaiju [[Morbius the Living Vampire#Spider-Geddon|M.O.R.B.I.U.S.]] caused the suit to malfunction, attain sentience, and go rogue, growing a mouth with cubic teeth and a green tongue-like wire (a reference to [[Evangelion (mecha)|Evangelion]]). Though SP//dr was able to defeat VEN#m, she was unable to stop it from consuming Addy as well as her version of [[Aunt May#Spider-Verse|Aunt May]], who flew in to fix the problem manually.<ref name="eosg">''Edge of Spider-Geddon'' #2 (2018).

===''Spider-Gwen''===
In this reality, Dr. '''Elsa Brock''' created the Venom symbiote from the radioactive spider isotopes developed by S.I.L.K. leader [[Silk (comics)#Earth-65|Cindy Moon]] to cure the [[Lizard (comics)#Spider-Gwen|Lizard formula]] as requested by the city's Kingpin, Matt Murdock, to offer [[Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)|Spider-Woman]] a solution to losing her powers and curing the new Lizard, [[Harry Osborn#Spider-Gwen|Harry Osborn]]. Gwen was forced to inject Harry with one of her spider isotopes, causing the serum inside him to mutate into Venom and attach to [[Alternative versions of Wolverine#Spider-Gwen|Wolverine]] before bonding to Gwen and forming '''Gwenom'''. Though Gwen succumbed to its bloodlust at first, after discovering her father was brutally beaten by the [[Rhino (comics)#Spider-Gwen|Rhino]] in prison, she eventually learned to control it. The symbiote in this universe despite being amorphous is actually some spiders working together being a "[[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] cousin" of the alien spider that gave Gwen her powers and is not affected by classic symbiote weaknesses like sonic attacks when without a host, the symbiote is vulnerable to sonic when only bonded to a host. Spider-Gwen eventually took full control of the symbiote and turned it into a replica of her classic costume.<ref>''Spider-Gwen'' vol. 2</ref> During ''[[Spider-Geddon]]'', the symbiote protected Spider-Gwen from [[Inheritors (comics)|Verna]]'s touch.<ref>''Spider-Geddon #2''.

===''Spider-Man Adventures''===
In this universe which predates the Big Bang of the Earth-616 universe, the history of Eddie Brock is identical to the Eddie of ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', with the difference being that instead of [[Dormammu]] and [[Baron Mordo]] bringing the Venom symbiote back to him, Eddie is reunited with the symbiote after the actions of [[Doctor Octopus]].<ref>''Spider-Man Adventures'' #1–12.

===''Spider-Man: India''===
In the final issue of the mini-series ''[[Spider-Man: India]]'' (Earth-50101), Venom appears as an exiled interdimensional demon. It is later explained, that Venom was trapped in an ancient amulet now used by tycoon [[Alternative versions of Green Goblin#Spider-Man: India|Nalin Oberoi]]. [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man#Pavitr Prabhakar|Pavitr Prabhakar]] is briefly possessed by the entity, but is rejected, and the amulet sucks in Oberoi, but in the final page, Venom is the only demon left. There is also a mention of '''Aadi''', who is this universe's Eddie Brock.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===''Spider-Man: Reign''===
In [[Kaare Andrews]]' ''[[Spider-Man: Reign]]'', set 30 years from current comics continuity, Venom has been posing as "Edward Saks", the aide to the Mayor of New York. "Edward" has been manipulating the city ever since Spider-Man's disappearance in preparation for his eventual return; in the process, he had re-enlisted the Sinister Six, replicated his symbiote thousands of times (chalking it up to being "lonely"), and built a security system named "WEBB" which prevents New York citizens from escaping from the city, trapping them while allegedly protecting them from the outside world. Upon meeting him, Venom is quick to berate Spider-Man for abandoning him all those years ago with a genuine sense of bitterness and sorrow, describing himself as a responsibility that Spider-Man neglected, leaving the wallcrawler at a loss for words. Defeated, the Sinister Six, Spidey and Venom have their final battle, in which [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] gives Spider-Man a detonator to make all the Sinners explode. Spidey presses the button, most likely killing Venom and putting an end to his "Reign" once and for all.<ref>''Spider-Man: Reign'' #1–4</ref>

===''Spider-Man: Life Story''===
In a continuity where characters naturally aged after Peter Parker became Spider-Man in 1962, Peter still acquired the Venom symbiote during the [[Secret Wars]] in the 1980s. Unlike the main continuity, Peter discovered that the black suit was a symbiote before [[Reed Richards]] did, but initially decided against getting rid of it due to his aging body. When [[Kraven the Hunter|Kraven]] tried burying Peter alive, the symbiote helped him escape the grave and nearly caused him to kill Kraven before Mary Jane helped separate it from him. The traumatic incident led Mary Jane to leave Peter, who abandoned the symbiote. It then bonded with Kraven before the hunter could commit suicide.<ref>''Spider-Man: Life Story'' #3.</ref>

In 2019, the Venom-possessed Kraven attacks Peter and Miles Morales in Doctor Doom's space station as the two heroes attempt to shut down Doom's technology across the planet. When he attempts to let the symbiote possess Miles, he discovers that Otto Octavius is possessing Miles' body, allowing Peter the chance to attack him with a sonic blast from his suit. When the symbiote separates from him, he is nothing more than a skeleton. As Peter stays behind on the space station to ensure the Doomsday Pulse activates, the symbiote helps him one last time by filling in the giant hole of the collapsing station. Once the pulse activates, the station explodes and kills Peter and the symbiote.<ref>''Spider-Man: Life Story #6: All My Enemies'', Chip Zdarsky, Marvel Comics</ref>

===''Spider-Verse''===

*In [[Spider-Punk]]'s universe, the Variable Engagement Neuro-sensitive Organic Mesh (aka '''V.E.N.O.M.''') is a suit of armor created by [[Oscorp]] and worn by the Thunderbolt Department, the police and fire department of President Osborn. They try to stop protests, but are all defeated by Spider-Punk and his Spider-Slayers.<ref name="sv2">''Spider-Verse'' #2 (2015)</ref>

He briefly clashed with the [[Autobots]], but then [[Optimus Prime]] convinced Spider-Man about their good motives. Spider-Man then aids the Autobots against the Decepticons.<ref>''Transformers'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== Ultimate Marvel ===
[[File:Venom (Ultimate Marvel version).jpg|thumb|upright|Venom (Ultimate Marvel version).]]
The Ultimate iteration of Venom was created by writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and artist [[Mark Bagley]] and was introduced in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #33, while the Conrad Markus version was introduced in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man Volume 2]]'' #16.1. His appearance was designed by Mark Bagley to be more of a monster than a supervillain, describing him as a "huge cancerous/tumorous creature".<ref>{{Cite magazine|author=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=14 July 2017|title=Marvel Legacy: Spider-Man goes back to basics, Venom becomes a protector|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|url=https://ew.com/books/2017/07/14/marvel-legacy-spider-man-venom/}}</ref>

====Eddie Brock Jr.====
The ''[[Ultimate Marvel]]'' version of Eddie Brock was a writer for the Daily Globe. He was at [[Justin Hammer#Ultimate Marvel|Justin Hammer]]'s press conference; his face is not shown, only his hands and arms appear.<ref>[[Bendis, Brian Michael]] (w), [[Bagley, Mark]] (p), ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #17. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Ultimate incarnation of Venom is vastly different from the E incarnation: '''Eddie Brock Jr.''' is Peter Parker's childhood friend (along with a college student who is a lab assistant for [[Lizard (character)#Ultimate Marvel|Curtis Connors]]) and the Venom symbiote is not extraterrestrial but is the second stage of a genetically created "suit" designed by [[Richard and Mary Parker#Ultimate Marvel|Richard Parker]] (Peter's father) and Eddie Brock Sr. (Eddie's father) as a cure for severe disease meant to bond to the user and protect them from internal and external harm. The suit is tailored for a specific DNA (Richard's in this case), and the person to whom it belongs can control the suit more easily. If, however, someone uses a suit designed for somebody else, they are constantly damaged by the suit which requires nourishment, gained by feeding on organic flesh, to function. If bonded to an incompatible host the Venom suit begins consuming them almost immediately, forcing them to feed on others to sustain it or die themselves. When taking a host, the organic matter that comprises the suit completely envelops the host, regardless of resistance, temporarily blinding it, before encasing itself in a hard, purple casing, similar to a [[pupa]], as it bonds further with the host. When the host emerges, the suit then shifts its appearance and function to assist its host, such as creating eyes for it to see through, or tries to take it over, inducing a homicidal rage and attempting to feed itself if bonded with an incompatible host. When bonded with a host and forcibly removed, the Venom suit leaves trace amounts of itself in their bloodstream, which attracts other samples of Venom to itself, and can overload Peter's spider-sense. In the video game ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', absorbing the trace amounts in Peter's blood allowed Eddie to take complete control of the suit, gaining a greater ability to talk and a spider symbol on his chest.

Venom's only known weakness is electricity, and larger amounts of the suit will need more electricity to kill, as varying amounts of the suit will be stunned or vaporized by electric shocks. This was first seen in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #38, when an electric wire got tangled around Venom's foot. An electrocution from live power-lines vaporised the smaller amount on Peter, while a similar amount disabled Eddie. Note in the video game ''Ultimate Spider-Man'', when [[Electro (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Electro]] electrocutes Venom during a cutscene, the suit is not affected by the shock like the live power-line did in the "Venom" arc. The suit can take the [[Shocker (character)#Ultimate Marvel|Shocker]]'s vibro-shocks, and can protect its host from a bullet, who feels nothing more than a relaxing vibration.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael. ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #34. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Venom suit was introduced when Peter Parker reunited with his childhood friend Eddie Brock Jr. to continue their fathers' research into a protoplasmic cure for cancer. Eddie Sr. had kept the suit in the lab for his son as his legacy. After finding that [[Bolivar Trask#Ultimate Marvel|Bolivar Trask]] had tried to weaponize his father's research, Peter attempted to steal a sample to conduct his own research on, but spilled it by accident.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael. ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #33. Marvel Comics.</ref> The original [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Man]] (Peter Parker) was able to control the suit to a greater extent than anyone because of his powers and because the suit was designed for his father. Feeding off Spider-Man's own thoughts, the suit enhanced his strength, generated its own webbing, and made him completely bulletproof. But when Spider-Man was chasing down an armed robber, the suit attempted to take over him, growing a fanged maw. After fighting for control, Spider-Man electrocuted the suit before returning to destroy the sample. Enraged, Eddie ignored Peter's warnings and used a second sample of the Venom suit on himself. Eddie, wearing the Venom suit, initially resembled a bulkier version of Spider-Man but the suit grew a fanged mouth, claws, tentacles and spinal ridges. Eddie hunted down Peter, intending to force him to be absorbed in the suit but was electrocuted by downed power lines and retreated.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael. ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #33–39. Marvel Comics.</ref>
Eddie was then captured by [[Silver Sable#Ultimate Marvel|Silver Sable]], who was hired by Bolivar since the suit technically belonged to him and ordered [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Adrian Toomes]] to conduct his experiments on the suit in an attempt to remove the suit from Eddie. Then [[Beetle (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Beetle]] tried to capture Venom, but Venom escaped and was confronted by Spider-Man. During a battle the suit eventually separated itself from Eddie and forcibly bonded itself with Peter, turning him into Venom. The [[Ultimates]] arrived and were able to separate Peter from the suit. Eddie later approached Peter and demanded that he retrieve the suit for him but was rebuffed. During a confrontation between Peter, Eddie and [[Gwen Stacy#Ultimate Marvel|Gwen Stacy]], Gwen transformed into [[Carnage (character)#Ultimate Marvel|Carnage]]. Contact with Carnage caused trace amounts of the suit within Eddie's body to multiply, transforming him into Venom, at which point the two symbiotes began to fight. After a brief battle the Venom symbiote absorbed all traces of the Carnage symbiote, leaving Gwen an ordinary human, and causing Venom to change into a new form even larger than before, with small glowing red eyes. Venom retreated from battle, and was later captured by the Beetle and taken to Latveria.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael. ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #123–128. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Venom appeared with his trademark white spider symbol in ''[[Ultimates 3]]''.<ref>[[Loeb, Jeph]] (w), [[Madureira, Joe]] (a), ''[[Ultimates 3]]'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> He attacks the Ultimates' [[Avengers Mansion#Ultimate Marvel|mansion]], demanding to find [[Alternative versions of Scarlet Witch#Ultimate Marvel|the woman]]. The Ultimates fight him until [[Thor (Ultimate Marvel character)|Thor]] strikes him with lightning, turning him into a puddle of organic matter. He is revealed to be an android created by [[Ultron#Ultimate Marvel|Ultron]] as a pawn in a master plan.<ref>Loeb, Jeph (w), Madureira, Joe (a), ''Ultimates 3'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

====Conrad Marcus====
'''Conrad Marcus''' was an employee at [[Oscorp#Ultimate Marvel|Oscorp]] that helped create the spider behind Miles Morales's powers.<ref>''[[Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man]]'' #1</ref> An employee of the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation#Ultimate Marvel|Roxxon Corporation]], Marcus willingly becomes the Venom symbiote's new host and was a more larger Venom than the Eddie Brock's version.

''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #16.1. December 2012. Marvel Comics.</ref> Afterwards, Venom destroys Oscorp's abandoned building and later appears at Miles's apartment due to his believing Jefferson to be the new Spider-Man. During the ensuing battle between Venom and Spider-Man, Jefferson is injured and taken to a hospital. Venom appears there, leading to another battle with Spider-Man and the police that accidentally kills both [[Rio Morales]] and Marcus.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael (w), [[Pichelli, Sara]] (a).

{{see also|What If (comics)}}

==== ...The alien costume had possessed Spider-Man? ====
In this one-shot, after obtaining the symbiote costume, Spider-Man waits too long before visiting [[Mr. Fantastic]] who would free him from the symbiote's control. The suit takes control of Spider-Man and as it constantly feeds on him, Spider-Man ages at an accelerated rate. Within days, Spider-Man dies of old age. Desperate to survive, the symbiote bonds with a weakened [[Hulk]]. [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] confronts Venom-Hulk. The costume explains that it is sorry for Spider-Man's death, but is draining the gamma radiation from Bruce Banner as repentance. Thor in disbelief defeats him, leading the symbiote to take over Thor. Banner however is shown cured of being The Hulk. The heroes employ [[Black Bolt]]'s incredibly powerful voice to create enough sonic damage to critically injure the symbiote.

Thor is freed, and the heroes prepare to transport the alien to another dimension. [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] takes matters into her own hands and kills the alien because of anger at the death of Spider-Man.<ref>{{comic book reference|writer=[[Fingeroth, Danny]] | penciller=Bagley, Mark|inker=[[Keith Williams (comics)|Williams, Keith]] | story=What if the Alien costume had possessed Spider-Man?|title=[[What If (comics)|What If]] | volume=2|issue= #4|date=October 1989|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>

==== ...Venom had possessed The Punisher? ====
In this one-shot issue, after the symbiote leaves Spider-Man, it joins with the [[Punisher]] instead of Eddie Brock. Castle uses the symbiote's abilities to further his war on crime; he used the suit's shape-shifting nature to create glider-wings and used its webbing as bullets.

The symbiote causes the Punisher's war to become more brutal and unrestrained than ever before as he set about confronting and killing many super-criminals. The symbiote eventually influences him to confront and beat Spider-Man, but before it can kill the Web Slinger, Castle's soldierly discipline wins out. With his new powers, Punisher takes out [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] and even the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]. At the climax of a confrontation with Spider-Man, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and [[Moon Knight]], from which the Punisher emerges victorious, a blast from Spider-Man's borrowed sonic blaster allows Punisher to overcome and tame the symbiote by convincing it that his war on crime means more to him than anything, even his own life, and would sooner commit suicide and kill them both if he did not have complete control over it.

The symbiote then recedes from Punisher's face and manifests his trademark Skull insignia upon his chest. Castle tells the assembled heroes that he is in control now before making his escape.<ref>{{Comic book reference| writer=[[Busiek, Kurt]] | artist=[[McDonnell, Luke]] | story=What if Venom had possessed The Punisher?|title=What If| volume=2| issue= #44|date=December 1992|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>

==== ...The Marvel Super-Heroes had remained on Battleworld? ====
In this one-shot issue, the Marvel Super-Heroes and Villains left alive from the [[Secret Wars]] after [[Galactus]]' and the [[Beyonder]]'s fatal battle find themselves trapped on Battleworld. Deciding to make the best of things, they all settle down and build new lives and families. Twenty-five years later, Spider-Man and the Venom symbiote are a single entity. With Reed Richards dead, there was no way to free Spider-Man from the symbiote and thus he was forced to accept this new way of life. Over time he becomes cold, calculating and emotionally distant from the rest of the group. The body of Peter Parker is now nothing more than a skeleton with the symbiote acting as his skin, much to the dismay of the other super-heroes and their children.<ref>''What If...'' vol. 2, #114</ref>

==== ...Spider-Man had rejected the Spider? ====
This one-shot issue presents a different approach to the events of ''[[Spider-Man: The Other]]'', where Peter Parker dies and is resurrected with greater spider powers. Instead, Peter rejects the chance to rise again in a new form and leaves his body and spirit separated. This leaves his body open to a complete takeover by the Venom symbiote. The suit quickly abandons its latest host, Mac Gargan, as soon as it senses Peter's vulnerable state and rushes to once again unite with its first host. After cocooning Peter's body, the symbiote fully bonds with Peter, turning him into a violent monster called [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man#What If?|Poison]]. Poison longs for a companion to join them in their new life and chooses Mary Jane. After dispatching the Avengers who rush to her aid, Watson offers herself willingly to prevent any further harm to the people protecting her. She promises Poison that she will give her body but not her soul and make Poison's life as miserable as possible. This seems to leave Poison heartbroken and he flees. Instead, he unearths the grave of [[Gwen Stacy]]. The last images reveal Poison watching over a new cocoon like his own, but crimson colored, as it bursts forth showing a hand similar to [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]]'s.<ref>{{Comic book reference| writer=[[David, Peter]] | penciller=Pham, Khoi|inker=[[Florea, Sandu]] | story=What if Spider-Man had rejected the Spider? – Poison Selves|title=What If| volume=3| issue= #2|date=November 2006|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] | page=| panel=}}</ref>

==== ...Iron Man: Demon in an Armor ====
In this one shot, which happens to take place in Earth-90211, Spider-Man has the Venom symbiote costume. Wade Wilson, as [[Deadpool]], is hired by Galactus to kill the Beyonder for merging [[MODOK]] to Galactus's rear end in exchange for the Community Cube. He was given a weapon called the Recton Expungifier, the only weapon that could kill the Beyonder. When Deadpool tracked down his target to a night club, he was enticed into the Beyonder's partying lifestyle, getting [[Jheri curl]]s in the process. While hanging out with the Beyonder in a flying limousine, Spider-Man broke into the car and demanded the symbiote costume be removed from himself. Beyonder's driver shoots Spider-Man out of the limousine and the symbiote leaves Spider-Man and merges with Deadpool, creating '''Venompool'''. However, after years of partying, Beyonder grew tired and threw Venompool to the world, snapping him out of the Beyonder's magic. Venompool attempted to resume his contract and kill the Beyonder, but he accidentally pawned the Recton Expungifier. He decides to get himself clean by kidnapping and selling a drunken [[Alternative versions of Iron Man#Demon in an Armor|Tony Stark]] to [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M]]. Unfortunately, he cannot join any major superhero teams, like the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] and [[Fantastic Four]] because of his newly acquired Jheri curls.

====...Spider-Man: Spider's Shadow====
This five-part series offers an alternate take on what would happen if Peter chose to keep the symbiote costume rather than reject it after Reed Richards revealed it was alive. Spider-Man starts acting more aggressive, even unmasking and threatening Hobgoblin (Roderick Kingsley) during an altercation. This leads Kingsley to track him down to May's house, where he blows it up and kills May in the process. Enraged, Peter brutally murders Hobgoblin and decides to take justice into his own hands by killing any criminals that come in his way. After Spider-Man seemingly kills the Kingpin, the Sinister Six (consisting of Kraven, Electro, Rhino, Mysterio, Eddie Brock possessing Doctor Octopus' arms and a reluctant [[J. Jonah Jameson]]) assemble in the countryside to take him down. Though Spider-Man kills Electro, Rhino, and Mysterio, Kraven and Jameson separate Peter from the symbiote after discovering its weakness to fire.

Jameson takes Peter home, where they meet up with Mary Jane and Black Cat and find out that Kingpin had leaked Spider-Man's secret identity to the press. As Felicia takes Jameson to safety, Peter and Mary Jane discover that the symbiote has possessed Reed and taken over the Baxter Building, where it has used his scientific knowledge to make itself stronger and take control of anyone inside, including the Thing. Knowing the suit still wants him, Peter ventures into the building with Mary Jane and the Human Torch, where they find out that the symbiote used Reed to create other symbiotes to possess the other heroes present near the building. It then orders them to attack Mary Jane, as Peter's love for her is what prevented it from taking over him completely. Spider-Man and the Torch then lure the symbiote back to the Baxter Building, where Peter offers himself to the symbiote willingly. After the symbiote kills Reed, it attempts to bond to Peter again, however it is revealed that "Peter" was actually a disguised Torch using Reed's image inducer that the real Peter gave him, allowing him to annihilate the symbiote with his flames. Peter turned himself in for the murders, but was ultimately declared not guilty since the other heroes who were possessed by symbiotes testified on his behalf. Susan Storm invites Peter to join the Fantastic Four to take Reed's place.

In the epilogue, it is revealed that Kingpin barely survived Spider-Man's brutal assault and is determined to get revenge on Peter. His assistant Wesley reveals that his doctors have gotten ahold of one of the symbiote's offspring, which resembles Carnage, to help him recover and give him the power he needs to take on Spider-Man.<ref>''Spider-Man: Spider's Shadow'' #1-5</ref>

===Television===
* Venom appeared in the 1990s ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series, with Spider-Man's version voiced by [[Christopher Daniel Barnes]] and Eddie Brock's version voiced by [[Hank Azaria]]. At the end of the episode "The Alien Costume, Part Two", Brock becomes Venom after Spider-Man rejects the symbiote. In "The Alien Costume, Part Three", Venom is defeated, separated from Brock, and returned to space. In the episodes "Venom Returns" and "Carnage", Venom returns to Earth, re-fuses with Brock, and joins forces with Spider-Man and [[Iron Man]] to combat [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]], [[Dormammu]], and [[Baron Mordo]] before sacrificing itself along with Brock to ensure the villains' defeat.
* The Eddie Brock incarnation of Venom appeared in the ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Brian Drummond]]. This version of the Venom symbiote evolved into a more powerful form, gaining full control of its host's body as well as acquiring elastic powers and the ability to change into a liquid-esque form. In the series, Venom and Carnage travel to [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]] to join the Synoptic, a hive mind of symbiotes, and ally themselves with the [[High Evolutionary]] while secretly helping the Synoptic grow powerful enough to infect the planet's population with symbiotes.
* Venom appeared in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' animated series, with Spider-Man's version voiced by [[Josh Keaton]] and Eddie Brock's version voiced by [[Benjamin Diskin]]. Introduced in the episode "[[The Uncertainty Principle (The Spectacular Spider-Man)|The Uncertainly Principle]]", the symbiote arrives on Earth by stowing away on [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]]'s [[Space Shuttle]]. After being rejected by Spider-Man, it bonds with Brock to seek revenge in the episode "Intervention", but is ultimately defeated in the episode "Nature vs. Nurture". Venom reappears in the episodes "First Steps", "Growing Pains", and "Identity Crisis", wherein it attempts to expose Spider-Man's secret identity, only to be foiled and separated from Brock once more, though it manages to escape.
* The Venom symbiote appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' animated series, with its primary hosts being '''[[Harry Osborn]]''' (voiced by [[Matt Lanter]]), the '''[[Norman Osborn|Green Goblin]]''' (voiced by [[Steven Weber (actor)|Steven Weber]]), and [[Flash Thompson]] (also voiced by Lanter).<ref>Mozzocco, J.

However, the symbiote takes control of him and fights Spider-Man and his team before being defeated once again. In the episode "Venomous", the Venom symbiote temporarily resurfaces inside Harry until it is seemingly destroyed by Doc Ock's [[Anti-Venom]] formula. In the episode "The Rise of the Goblin", the Green Goblin tries to have Harry as Venom join him, before taking the symbiote for himself when his son refuses. In the episode "Carnage", the Goblin uses the Venom symbiote to create the Carnage symbiote, but it is defeated by Harry using trace amounts of the Venom symbiote in his body, which he later relinquishes. In the episode "Venom Bomb", the Goblin uses the Venom symbiote to infect the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[Helicarrier]], including himself, until Spider-Man and Doc Ock create another Anti-Venom formula, destroying all remaining traces of the Venom symbiote. In the two-part episode "The Avenging Spider-Man", Doc Ock creates more of the Venom symbiote and joins forces with [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] to assemble an army of symbiote-infected monsters, which are ultimately defeated by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. In the episode "Agent Venom", a piece of the Venom symbiote that survived the battle with the Avengers attaches to [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]] and later Thompson, who shows an unusual amount of control over it and becomes Agent Venom for the rest of the series.<ref>Arrant, Chris (July 20, 2013).

The symbiote briefly merges with Spider-Man from the episode "Sandman" until "Stark Expo", and Flash Thompson during the episode "Venom" before it is recaptured. In season two, the V-252 merges with Eddie Brock, who renames it Venom in the episode "Dead Man's Party". In the episode "Venom Returns", Venom is incapacitated by an experimental sonic device during a failed attempt to publicly expose Spider-Man's secret identity. In the episode "Superior", Venom is reawakened by experimentation that alters its genealogy, enabling it to survive without a host, but it is defeated by Spider-Man. In the episode "Web of Venom" Pt. 2, Venom is accidentally freed by [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]] and absorbs a synthetic copy. It makes its way to the meteor crash site and uses an energy seed to shoot a beam into space before Spider-Man kills it. In the episode "Amazing Friends", the beam is revealed to be a beacon that summoned the other [[Klyntar]] from Venom's home planet and directed them to Earth. In the series finale, "Maximum Venom", a fragment of Venom is revealed to have survived and bonded with '''[[Max Modell]]'''. Seeking revenge on Spider-Man for thwarting its race's invasion, it builds a portal to its home planet and summons several Klyntar, but they are defeated by Spider-Man's allies while Modell overcomes Venom's control and destroys its seed, permanently vanquishing the symbiote.

* The Eddie Brock incarnation of Venom appears as a boss, later a supporting character, in the 2000 ''[[Spider-Man (2000 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' video game, voiced by [[Daran Norris]]. After being attacked by an impostor Spider-Man at [[Doctor Octopus|Otto Octavius]]' science exposition, Brock becomes Venom again to exact revenge and kidnaps Spider-Man's wife [[Mary Jane Watson]]. When he learns of this, Spider-Man chases Venom through the city and the sewers, eventually defeating him in his lair and saving Mary Jane. After learning Spider-Man was framed, Venom offers to make amends by helping him figure out who did it. Venom later helps Spider-Man fight [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] and joins [[Captain America]] and [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] in rescuing Spider-Man from Doctor Octopus' self-destructing base.
* The [[Ultimate Marvel]] iteration of Eddie Brock / Venom appears as a playable character and the final boss in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' video game, with the former voiced by Daniel Capallaro and the latter voiced by [[Arthur Burghardt]]. The symbiote suit is also available as an alternate costume for Spider-Man and appears briefly in the game's opening scene. In a separate storyline that crosses over with Spider-Man's, Venom is hunted by [[Bolivar Trask]], who wants the [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] for experimentation. After being captured by [[Silver Sable]] following a battle with Spider-Man, Brock is forced to test the symbiote for Trask by fighting [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] and tracking down Peter Parker, whose DNA will supposedly improve Brock's control over the symbiote, but Venom escapes. He later defeats the [[Beetle (comics)|Beetle]] and interferes in a fight between Parker and Sable, which leads to him being defeated and recaptured by Trask. After escaping and defeating a Carnage symbiote-possessed Parker, Venom absorbs it from him, gaining complete control over his own symbiote in the process. Though Spider-Man stops him from killing Trask, Venom escapes from prison and does so later anyway.
* The Eddie Brock incarnation of Venom appears in the ''[[Spider-Man 3 (video game)|Spider-Man 3]]'' film tie-in game, voiced by Topher Grace.

* The Eddie Brock incarnation of Venom appears as a playable character in ''[[Spider-Man: Friend or Foe]]'', voiced by [[Quinton Flynn]]. He and several other supervillains fight Spider-Man until they are all attacked by P.H.A.N.T.O.M.s created by [[Mysterio]] using shards of the meteor that brought the Venom symbiote to Earth. Venom is captured along with the other villains, placed under mind control, and sent to [[Transylvania]] to retrieve a meteor shard located there. After Spider-Man defeats Venom and destroys the mind-control device, the latter joins forces with the web-slinger to exact revenge on Mysterio.
* The Eddie Brock incarnation of Venom appears as the main antagonist of ''[[Spider-Man: Web of Shadows]]'', voiced by [[Keith Szarabajka]]. During this game, part of his symbiote splits off from him and bonds with Spider-Man, giving the web-slinger access to the black suit again. Venom attacks Manhattan with an army of symbiotes, leading to Spider-Man joining forces with [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]], among others to defeat him. Following several encounters, Spider-Man confronts Venom at S.H.I.E.L.D.'s [[Helicarrier]], during which Venom takes on a giant, five-headed form. Despite destroying four of the heads, Spider-Man fails to kill Venom, so he appeals to Brock's better nature. After Brock emerges from Venom, Spider-Man can either kill Venom himself or allow Brock to sacrifice himself to do so. Regardless of the choice made, Venom dies, allowing Spider-Man to stop the invasion or take control of the symbiotes himself.
** In the [[PlayStation 2|PS2]] and [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] versions of the game, the [[Tinkerer (Marvel Comics)|Tinkerer]] captures Venom after he attacks Manhattan with his symbiote army and the final boss is a large symbiote with seven heads that contains Venom's consciousness.
** In the [[Nintendo DS]] version, Venom is not the cause of the invasion. Instead, he is trying to stop it as well, and becomes an ally of Spider-Man's after the web-slinger defeats him.

Backstory for the game also reveals that the game's version of [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]] was created using a "black goo" recovered from space.
* A variation of the Venom symbiote appears in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'' film tie-in game. [[Oscorp]] runs a secret experiment at [[Ravencroft]] called the "Venom Project", using [[nanites]] as regenerating body armor that grant enhanced strength. This project later gives [[Cletus Kasady]] the Carnage symbiote. The symbiote suit is also available as an alternate costume for Spider-Man via [[downloadable content|DLC]].
** The Eddie Brock incarnation of Venom appears in the mobile version of the game, voiced again by [[Benjamin Diskin]]. Originally a photographer who tricks Spider-Man into fighting crooks and allowing him to take pictures of him in action, Brock later investigates Oscorp but gets caught, forcing Spider-Man to save him. However, upon investigating a second time, Brock discovers their illegal activities and is transformed into Venom, who goes on a rampage until Spider-Man defeats him and removes the symbiote from him.

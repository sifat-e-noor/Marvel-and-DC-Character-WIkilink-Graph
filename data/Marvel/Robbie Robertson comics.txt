'''Joseph''' "'''Robbie'''" '''Robertson''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], usually in stories featuring the superhero [[Spider-Man]]. Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[John Romita Sr.]], he first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #51 (August 1967),<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=298}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Kunka |first=Andrew J. |editor-last1=Aldama |editor-first1=Frederick Luis |date=2020 |chapter=Adaption and Racial Representation in Dell/Gold Key Tie-Ins |title=The Oxford Handbook of Comic Book Studies |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q5n9DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA566 |location=New York City |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=566 |isbn=978-0190917944}}</ref> and has since endured as a supporting character of the wall-crawler.

Robbie Robertson was one of the first [[African Americans|black]] characters in comics to play a serious supporting role, rather than act as comic relief.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wells |first1=John |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1965-1969 |date=2014 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490557 |page=186}}</ref> He has usually been a high-ranking editor at the [[New York City|New York]] [[newspaper]], the ''[[The Daily Bugle|Daily Bugle]]'', and a close friend and confidant of [[publisher]] [[J. Jonah Jameson]], acting as a voice of reason in Jameson's campaign to discredit Spider-Man.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=123}}</ref> He is more friendly and supportive of Peter Parker as well as the other ''Daily Bugle'' staffers than the brash Jameson. In the 1980s, the character's backstory was explored, revealing a past conflict with the supervillain [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]], with whom he attended high school; these stories were well received by readers and contributed to greater interest in his character.

The character has appeared in several media adaptations outside of comics over the years, including films, animated series, and video games. Actor [[Bill Nunn]] played Robbie Robertson in [[Sam Raimi]]'s [[Spider-Man (2002 film series)|''Spider-Man'' trilogy]].

==Publication history==
[[Gerry Conway]]'s run on ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' and ''[[Web of Spider-Man]]'' expanded Robertson's back story with a dark history involving the hit man [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] which continues to haunt Robertson in the present. The stories drew an exceptionally intense level of reader interest. Editor [[Jim Salicrup]] recalled that "some of the most jaded, seen-it-all before guys - namely the guys in Marvel's production department - got hooked on the Tombstone/Joe Robertson [[soap opera]]. They'd actually come into my office concerned about what was going to happen to Robbie next. 'He's not going to jail, is he?' they'd ask".<ref>{{cite journal|last= Aushenker|first= Michael|date= October 2010|title= Not Amazing, but Spectacular|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 44| page= 57|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Joseph Robertson was born in [[Harlem]]. He is married to Martha and they have had two sons. Their first son, Patrick Henry Robertson, died when he was only six months old. Their second son, [[Randy Robertson|Randy]], is divorced. Growing up in a working-class family and being a member of a racial minority, Robertson seemed to sympathize with the downtrodden, including Marvel Comics' mutants, and he preached [[Toleration|tolerance]]. He was forced to practice what he preached when his son came home from college with his white [[Jewish]] wife, Amanda.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #117. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Robertson is the [[editor-in-chief]] of the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', the newspaper at which Peter Parker works and sells his photographs of Spider-Man. Unlike the ''Bugle''{{'}}s volatile [[publisher]], [[J. Jonah Jameson]], Robbie tries his best to remain objective towards Spider-Man. Robbie is also the only ''Bugle'' employee who does not fear the wrath of his boss and is ready to stand up to him on editorial matters. Robbie serves as publisher when Jameson temporarily steps down. Robbie was a close personal friend of Captain [[George Stacy]], and it has been implied, although not outright stated, that Robbie has deduced Spider-Man's secret identity, as Stacy did. Robbie's son Randy is also a close friend of Peter Parker, and the two briefly share an apartment when Mary Jane is presumed dead and Peter had been evicted.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #18. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Robbie grew up in [[Harlem]], and as a teenager was a classmate of Lonnie Thompson Lincoln, later infamous as the brutal hit man [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]]. Robbie once wrote an article for the high school newspaper about Lincoln's bullying and extortion, but [[Spike (journalism)|spiked]] it after being threatened by Lincoln. Years later, while working as a reporter in [[Philadelphia]], Robbie witnessed Lincoln murder one of Robbie's contacts. Once again, Lincoln threatened Robertson, and the journalist fled to [[New York City]] and began working for the ''Bugle''. He told no one of the murder he witnessed.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #139. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Twenty years later, when Tombstone takes a job with the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], Robbie, determined not to be intimidated again, begins collecting evidence of past crimes that would have Tombstone incarcerated for life. Tombstone hunts Robbie down and breaks his back with his bare hands. Robbie is laid up for months as a result of this, but makes a full recovery, as his spine was not broken.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #145. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Tombstone is arrested and tried, thanks in part to Spider-Man. Breaking 20 years of silence, Robbie testifies against his old schoolmate in court. The judge, however, is on the Kingpin's payroll and circumstances lead to Robertson having to agree to serve 3 years himself for withholding evidence of the Philadelphia murder. Robbie and Tombstone end up in the same cell block, where the hit man makes Robbie's life miserable. So broken is Robbie's spirit that he halfheartedly goes along with a jailbreak. However, when Tombstone attacks an interfering Spider-Man, Robbie regains his nerve and saves him. Robbie and Tombstone fall out of the escape helicopter and land in a river near an [[Amish]] farm.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #155. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Things came to a head when Robbie moved to defend the farmer's family from Tombstone, stabbing him with a pitchfork. Stunned by this, Tombstone backs off.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #157. Marvel Comics.</ref> While Tombstone has not abandoned his murderous ways, he has officially called off his vendetta on Robbie. Robbie receives a pardon and resumes work at the ''Daily Bugle''.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #161. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After Peter's [[Civil War (comics)|"coming out"]], Robbie reveals he knew Peter was Spider-Man and stands up to J. Jonah Jameson after all the years about his treatment to Peter/Spider-Man. Unable or unwilling to admit that he had gone too far in his hatred of Spider-Man, Jameson fires Robertson. However, he rehires him shortly after.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

During the "[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]" storyline, where all knowledge of Peter Parker's marriage to Mary Jane has been erased by [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] and Spider-Man's secret identity has somehow been removed from the minds of everyone in the world, Jameson suffers a heart attack brought on by arguing with Peter Parker, and the ''Bugle'' is bought by [[Dexter Bennett]], who turns it into a scandalous, muck-raking rag. Robbie, though disapproving, decides to stay, hoping Bennet will get better.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #559</ref> He soon realizes that is not going to happen, particularly after learning the ''DB'' was indirectly responsible for the death of several people shown on their paper from one of their scandals<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #560</ref> and resigns. Robertson becomes the editor for [[Ben Urich]]'s newspaper, ''Front Line''.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Sometime after the ''DB'''s destruction, Jameson, as the Mayor of New York City, cashed in the ''DB'' shares he acquired from Bennett and gave the money to Robbie Robertson. Jameson asked Robertson to remake ''Front Line'' (which itself was on hard times) into the new ''Daily Bugle''.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #648 (January 2011)</ref>

After Phil Urich is exposed as the new [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]], to protect the ''Daily Bugle'''s reputation, Robbie benches Ben Urich until this situation blows over and fires Phil's ex-girlfriend [[Norah Winters]].<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #16</ref> During the later Goblin coup of New York, Ben attempts to arrange a meeting to talk Phil down and convince him to accept a cure for the Goblin formula, but when Robbie is discovered in the area, Phil believes that Ben was trying to set a trap and delivers a serious injury to Robbie before Spider-Man appears.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' Annual #2</ref>

==Other versions==

===''Age of Apocalypse''===
In the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' reality, Robbie Robertson is editor of the ''Daily Bugle'', which in this timeline is a clandestine paper dedicated to informing humans of the secrets of Apocalypse. He is killed by the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]]-infested [[Corsair (comics)|Christopher Summers]] (the father of [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott]], [[Havok (comics)|Alex]] and [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Gabriel Summers]]).<ref>''Tales from the Age of Apocalypse'' #2 (December, 1997)</ref>

===Marvel Noir===
In ''[[Marvel Noir|Spider-Man Noir: Eyes without a Face]]'', Robbie is investigating the disappearances of African-Americans from Harlem, which leads him to accompany Peter Parker to meet [[Otto Octavius]] on Ellis Island. Robbie is captured, and later lobotomised, as Doctor Octopus is operating on the aforementioned African-Americans in order to try to get the perfect slave. Peter eventually liberates the prisoners, but feels remorse for not getting to Robbie sooner. Later, Robbie's family, and [[Glory Grant]], are outraged that Octavius did not stand trial, as he was doing government research.<ref>''Spider-Man Noir: Eyes Without a Mask'' #1-4</ref>

===MC2===
In the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe, Robbie Robertson was killed by [[Doctor Octopus]] shortly after the disappearance/retirement of Spider-Man. This motivates Jameson to initiate "Project: Human Fly", an attempt to create a government controlled superhero. This adventure also features Richie Robertson, Robbie's grandson.<ref>''The Buzz'' #1 (July 2000)</ref>

===Spider-Verse===
During the ''[[Spider-Verse]]'' storyline, the Earth-001 version of Robbie Robertson works as an importer/trader in service to the Inheritors. Robbie is served at his import company by Lance Bannon and Nicholas Katzenberg. He met Verna's servant [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Ms. Drew]] at the docks to delivery barrels full of wine for a grand feast that the Inheritors had prepared from their hunt on the Spider Totems.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #9</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Robbie does not have much of a relationship with Peter due to the ''Bugle'' not being as big a role in Peter's life. Robbie has been employed there a number of years before Peter showed up. He is frequently seen arguing with Jameson (usually aided by Ben Urich), though it rarely ends up in shouting, as it does in Earth-616.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

===What If===
In ''[[What If (comics)|What If]] Gwen Stacy had lived?'', Robbie gives Gwen away to Peter at their wedding, but the wedding is ruined when Jameson appears; with the Goblin having mailed evidence of Spider-Man's true identity to Jameson, Jameson has published the story and now has a warrant for Peter's arrest. Disgusted at Jameson's disregard of all the times that Peter has saved his life as Spider-Man, Robbie angrily quits the ''Bugle'' and walks off with Gwen, assuring her that they will do all that they can to help Peter.<ref>''What If?'' #24</ref>

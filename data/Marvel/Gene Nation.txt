'''Morlocks''' are a group of [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] characters appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The characters are usually depicted as being associated with the [[X-Men]] in the [[Marvel Universe]]. Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Paul Smith (comics)|Paul Smith]], they were named after the [[Morlock|subterranean race of the same name]] in [[H. G. Wells]]' novel ''[[The Time Machine]]'', but unlike in the Wells book, they are not a faceless, threatening mass of villains. They first appeared as a group in ''[[The Uncanny X-Men]]'' #169 (May [[1983 in comics|1983]]).<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=248}}</ref> [[Caliban (Marvel Comics)|Caliban]] appeared prior to that, but he was not yet a member of the Morlocks.

The Morlocks were depicted as an underground society (both [[Underground living|literally]] and [[Underground society|figuratively]]) of outcast mutants living as [[mole people|tunnel dwellers]] in the [[sewerage|sewer]]s, abandoned tunnels, and [[List of closed New York City Subway stations|abandoned subway lines]] beneath [[New York City]]. The Morlocks were composed of mutant misfits, especially those mutants who, because of physical mutations or other conspicuous manifestations of their mutant genetics, were unable to pass as human in normal society. Subjected to hate, fear, and disgust from human society due to their "deformed" appearances, dangerous mutations, or otherwise [[outcast (person)|outcast]] or misfit statuses, most of the Morlocks viewed humans (and even more mainstream mutants such as the X-Men) with distrust and anger, and they occasionally committed criminal or antisocial acts upon the above-ground human society.

Due to a series of tragedies, the original Morlocks no longer reside in subterranean New York City (except [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]], who was one of the original Morlocks as a child), although a violent splinter cell [[Gene Nation]] and a comparable group called '''Those Who Live in Darkness''' have emerged. Similar groups, called Morlocks by readers and/or the X-Men themselves, have appeared under [[Chicago]] and [[London]].

==History==
According to [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]], she formed the Morlocks by first recruiting [[Caliban (Marvel Comics)|Caliban]], and then using his power to track down other mutants who were unable to integrate into normal society. The Morlocks initially [[squatting|squatted]] in a network of abandoned, interconnected tunnels beneath [[Manhattan]], which had originally been built as [[Cold War]] [[bomb shelter]]s and then forgotten.<ref name="UX170">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #170 (June 1983). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The X-Men were alerted to the existence of the Morlocks when their leader Callisto kidnapped [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] and intended to make him her mate.<ref name="X-Men 169">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #169. Marvel Comics.</ref> This brought [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] to challenge Callisto to a duel for leadership of the Morlocks. Victorious, Storm<ref name="UX170"/> orders an end to their attacks on normal humans,<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #171. Marvel Comics.</ref> but she does not assume leadership of the Morlocks full-time. Against her wishes, several Morlocks later kidnap the child superheroes [[Power Pack]] so that they could be raised by the Morlock Annalee, who had lost her own children. When Callisto discovers what was going on, she forces Annalee to let them go. They promise to return in the future to keep her company.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #195 (July 1985)</ref>

A majority of the Morlocks are slaughtered by [[Mister Sinister]]'s [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] in the "[[Mutant Massacre]]". Most of the survivors move on to join [[Gene Nation]], having lived in a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|pocket dimension]] led by [[Mikhail Rasputin]]. [[Leech (comics)|Leech]] instead becomes a ward of [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]. Other survivors include [[Erg (comics)|Erg]] and [[Beautiful Dreamer (Marvel Comics)|Beautiful Dreamer]] (whose whereabouts were unknown until [[Decimation (comics)|"Decimation"]]), [[Thornn]], (who would join [[X-Corporation]]), and Caliban.

It is later revealed that many of the Morlocks were actually failed experiments of the [[Dark Beast]], although he made certain that they didn't remember being tampered with, however Mister Sinister recognized that the Morlocks were based on his own genetic studies (which the Dark Beast learned from the Sinister of his reality), and that's why he ordered the Marauders to kill the entire underground society.

A new group called the Tunnel Rats which also calls itself "Those Who Live in Darkness" have inhabited the sewer tunnels just below the surface of Mutant Town/[[District X]]. ''District X'' writer [[David Hine]] claims to never have intended this group to have any ties to the original Morlocks.<ref>''District X'' #8-12. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]" storyline, some of the remaining powered Morlocks sought out asylum at the X-Mansion.<ref>''Generation M'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> There were some Morlocks that remained underground under Marrow's protection.<ref>''X-Men: The 198'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[X-Men: Endangered Species|Endangered Species]]" storyline, Masque and the Morlocks with him began their search for Magneto where they had some future-telling diaries with them where one of them states that Magneto is still a mutant in light of M-Day.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #487-491. Marvel Comics.</ref>

At the time when the Terrigen Cloud was loose on Earth infecting mutants with M-Pox since the "[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]" storyline, the number of mutants that are living underground had increased. In addition to these mutants, Callisto showed sympathy towards the humans who sought out refuge from the global landscape. As a way to live out the dream of Professor X, this unified society of humans and mutants lived together as the New Morlocks.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 4 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Morlock are further decimated by the Mauraders, but Cyclops helps the Chechnyan government expel rebels in exchange for a Morlock sanctuary.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' vol 5. #15.

===Africa/Gene Nation===
With the Morlocks presumed dead from the floods caused by [[Mikhail Rasputin]], some of the remaining Morlocks were relocated to [[Selima Oasis]] in [[North Africa]].

In ''X-Men: Prime'' many of the Hill Morlocks returned to found [[Gene Nation]]. As the new group, they attacked the human oppressors of the past Morlocks under the leadership of [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]].

===After M-Day===
After M-Day, some former Morlocks who lost their powers were Angel Dust, Boost, Callisto, Delphi, Irving, Marrow, [[Postman (comics)|Postman]], Qwerty, Shatter, Tether and the probability of [[Feral (comics)|Feral]] and [[Thornn]]. However, Feral and Thornn were later seen re-powered; but this was later to be revealed in ''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #54-55 that only their physical mutations were restored, not their mutant powers, which led to Feral being killed by [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]].

In one of [[Generation M (comics)|Generation M]]'s "Ex-Mutants' Diaries," Sally interviews Marrow about the Morlocks. Marrow reports that 80% of the remaining Morlocks (which was most likely already very small) are depowered now and look like humans. She states that most of them are still afraid about going out of the tunnels.

Currently, Marrow works as a watchman of the Morlocks, as she is called by the remaining ones when problems occur. She explained this status in the aftermath of thirteen depowered Morlocks murdered by [[Ghoul (comics)|Ghoul]].

One character commented that, post-M-Day, the chance of meeting a Morlock in the tunnels under New York is now harder than meeting an alligator in the Floridian sewers.

Some former Morlocks who actually kept their powers sought refuge at [[X-Mansion|Xavier's Institute]] and became known as the '''[[X-Men: The 198|198]].''' They are Beautiful Dreamer, Caliban, Erg, Leech, and Skids.

Dark Beast and Mikhail Rasputin are also still powered, though Mikhail is in Kapalan.

===The Extremists===
During [[Ed Brubaker]]'s "The Extremists" arc, the Morlocks reappear under the leadership of Masque and now consisting of Bliss, Erg, Litterbug, Skids and a recently captured Leech. Later in this story, it was revealed Skids only joined the Morlocks to spy on them on behalf of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]

One known Morlock member was [[Fatale (Marvel Comics)|Artemis]].<ref>''Factor X'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

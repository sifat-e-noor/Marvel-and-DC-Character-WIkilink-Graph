==History==
Madripoor is a fictional location apparently modeled on [[Singapore]].<ref name="FB">{{cite news | last = Boatz | first = Darrel L. | date = November 1988 | title = John Buscema | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = #62 | pages = 18–19 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}</ref> They are both wealthy maritime Asian island port nations at a strategic location with a single major city. However, Madripoor is not Singapore itself, as Singapore exists in the [[Marvel Universe]] as well, including the comics explicitly stating Madripoor as it being an island south of Singapore. Also distinct from Singapore is that Madripoor is divided between a '''Hightown''' and '''Lowtown''', places which are wealthy and crime-stricken respectively.<ref name="FB"/> [[X-23]] and Gambit once chartered a boat from Singapore to Madripoor, showing that they are both distinct locations.

Its capital and single large city is also called Madripoor. Madripoor was once a haven for [[Piracy|pirate]]s,<ref>''Old Man Logan'' #34 (2018). Marvel Comics.</ref> and that tradition is somewhat continued today with its lawless quality. The principality does not allow other nations to [[extradition|extradite]] criminals. However, it is one of the business capitals of the [[Pacific Rim]], with its own [[World Trade Centers Association|Trade Center]].{{citation needed|date=August 2007}}

Other locations of note in the Central Business District are the Bank of Hong Kong and the Bank of Malaysia, luxurious Sovereign Hotel, and the Prince's Palace, said to rival [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]].<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #6 (April 1989). Marvel Comics.</ref>

During World War II, [[Baron Strucker]] and [[The Hand (comics)|The Hand]] attempted to obtain a young [[Natasha Romanova]], and were opposed by [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]] and [[Logan (comics)|Logan]].<ref name="uxmv1no268">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #268</ref>

An attempt was made to conquer the nation by [[China]]. General Lo Chien attempts an invasion using modern and mystical weaponry but is stopped by the ad-hoc 'Heroes for Hire' group.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' #18-19 (Dec. 1998-Jan. 1999). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The nation was taken over by [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] with [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Madame Hydra]] as de facto ruler, using the nation to finance terrorist plots against the world. Side-effects of this are seen in ''Spider-Woman: Agent Of [[S.W.O.R.D. (comics)|S.W.O.R.D.]]''<ref>''Spider-Woman: Agent Of S.W.O.R.D.'' #1-5 (2009). Marvel Comics.</ref> With HYDRA's terrorist operations causing deaths in the thousands, [[Iron Man]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] took it upon themselves to overthrow the HYDRA regime and place the nation in the hands of [[Jessan Hoan|Tyger Tiger]], as she was the only person—apart from the long-absent [[Wolverine (character)|Patch]]—who the natives would follow in the event of a revolt. Stark wanted someone who would run Madripoor the right way without needing someone else to monitor them and ensure that the situation did not repeat itself.<ref>''Iron Man: Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' Annual #1 (Nov. 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Despite this, the real power fell to Seraph, the owner and operator of the Princess Bar. Her death followed the death of Police Chief Tai. Criminal elements began fighting over Madripoor, forcing Tyger Tiger into hiding. Viper tried to make a return, with programmable murderous entities called [[Predator X (comics)|Predator X]].<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' #3 (2009). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Madripoor is later controlled by Wolverine's son [[Daken]] after he managed to wrestle and manipulate power away from Tyger Tiger by acquiring control of various financial resources and key people. This results in several days of intense violence throughout the entire nation.<ref>''Dark Wolverine'' #5-7 (2011). Marvel Comics.</ref> Part of this chaos was the result of [[Malcolm Colcord]], who wanted free rein in Madripoor for his super-soldier experiments. Colcord was stopped by Daken, Tyger, [[X-23]] and Gambit. After Daken's death, Tyger Tiger was once again the figurehead of Madripoor.

A prominent Madripoor hotel was later used to hold an auction for a videotape of [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] committing an illegal assassination. Barton was captured while trying to retrieve the tape, but was rescued by [[Hawkeye (Kate Bishop)|Kate Bishop]], who had infiltrated the hotel by tying up and gagging [[Madame Masque]] and stealing her identity.<ref>''Hawkeye'' #4-5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the pages of ''[[Avengers World]]'', it is revealed that Madripoor rests on the head of a giant dragon that is as large as an island continent. The giant dragon was awakened by a ritual performed by [[Gorgon (Tomi Shishido)|Gorgon]] and the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]].<ref name="Avengers World #1">''Avengers World'' #3 (Feb. 2014)</ref> The beast decides to attack Shanghai, China.<ref>''Avengers World'' #13 (2014). Marvel Comics.</ref> It is beaten and returned in the following issue by Shang-Chi.<ref>''Avengers World'' #14 (2014). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Mystique tried to make Madripoor a mutant utopia; this involved flooding the island with 'Mutant Growth Hormone', a drug which grants powers.<ref>''All-New X-Men'' #37 (2012). Marvel Comics.</ref>

[[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] and the [[All-New X-Men|time displaced X-Men]] use Madripoor's Hightown as the location for their headquarters in ''X-Men Blue'' where Magneto is secretly trying to find a way to send the time-displaced X-Men back to their original timeline under the guise of working alongside them.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #1 (2017)</ref> At the same time, the time-displaced X-Men secretly train themselves in case Magneto returns to his villainous roots and tries to kill them.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #2 (2017). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Tyger Tiger re-establishes herself as the pre-eminent power on the island. She is opposed by the criminal Kimura, who has gained control over most of the criminal elements. A failed assassination attempt on Tyger is stopped by the X-Men, Gambit and the young hero Gabby.<ref>''All-New Wolverine'' #16-17 (2017). Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Hunt for Wolverine]]" storyline, Kitty Pryde led Domino, Jubilee, Psylocke, Rogue, and Storm to Madripoor to confront Magneto when he was suspected of stealing Wolverine's body. He agreed to tell them everything he knows at the King's Impresario Restaurant in Hightown. When it came to the meeting, it was revealed that Magneto is actually [[Mindblast]] in disguise as Kitty Pryde's group are attacked by Viper, [[Knockout (Marvel Comics)|Knockout]], [[Sapphire Styx]], and [[Whiplash (Marvel Comics)|Snake Whip]]. This trip also included investigating Madripoor's space launching facilities, which are available for anyone to rent.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor'' #1-4 Marvel Comics (2018). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Wolverine learns, through an adventure with the Black Cat, that the pre-teen criminal conspiracy called "The Hellfire Club," has taken over the criminal underworld of Madripoor.<ref>''Black Cat'' #10 (2020). Marvel Comics.</ref> This group, sometimes referred to as Homines Verendi, has taken direct hostile action against the island nation [[Krakoa]].<ref>''Marauders'' #9-11 (2020). Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "Iron Man 2020" event, [[Albert (comics)|Albert]] arrived on Madripoor looking for Elsie-Dee. After meeting Tyger Tiger, Albert was directed to Donald Pierce's company Reavers Universal Robotics where he confronted Donald Pierce. After Albert subdues the Reavers, Donald states that he sold Elsie-Dee's head to yakuza boss Kimura, the arms to the Jade Dragon Triad, and the legs to the Vladivostok Mafia. After he gets the parts from them, Albert puts Elsie-Dee back together. In light of Albert's actions towards them, the Reavers, Kimura, the Jade Dragon Triad, and the Vladivostok Mafia decide to take action against Albert vowing that he will never make it out of Madripoor alive.<ref name="2020 iWolverine #1">''2020 iWolverine'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> In downtown Madripoor, Donald Pierce and the Reavers are traveling through the vacant streets as they state that Albert and Elsie-Dee will have to travel through the Vladivostok Mafia's turf before they can engage them. Albert and Elsie-Dee engage the Vladivostok Mafia where they kill some members. Albert and Elsie-Dee then enter the Jade Dragon Triad's turf and fight its members. On the J-Town stretch of High Street, Kimura's men prepare for Albert and Elsie-Dee's arrival as Kimura informs Sachinko that they cannot let Elsie-Dee walk around with the account books' information in her head. As Albert and Elsie-Dee approach, Kimura's men open fire as they ram through the roadblock. Kimura stops the attack and informs Albert and Elsie-Dee about what Donald Pierce has planned for him at Madripoor Airport. As Kimura's limousine fools the Reavers into thinking that Albert and Elsie-Dee hijacked it and fire the railgun on it, Kimura smuggles Albert and Elsie-Dee out of Madripoor in a box claiming that it is filled with slot machine parts bound for Macao. Elsie-Dee states to Albert that they will get him upgraded.<ref>''2020 iWolverine'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Madripoor is estimated to be {{convert|100|mi|km}} in diameter. Its coastline is pockmarked with deep water bays and [[inlet]]s. The center of the island is a large plateau with steep cliffs.

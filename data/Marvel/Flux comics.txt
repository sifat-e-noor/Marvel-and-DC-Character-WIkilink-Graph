'''Fang''' is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics.

Fang is a Lupak who is a member of the Royal Elite of the [[Shi'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (Marvel Comics)|Imperial Guard]]. Created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Dave Cockrum]], the character first appeared in ''X-Men'' #107 (Oct. 1977). Fang appears to be a hybrid of an alien and a wolf; he has superhuman senses, strength, speed, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes, as well as claws and fangs. In recent years,<ref name=Wolverines /> the character has developed new abilities, including teleportation, flight, and energy projection/matter manipulation. (Like many original members of the Imperial Guard, Fang is the analog of a character from [[DC Comics]]' [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]: in his case [[Timber Wolf (comics)|Timber Wolf]].)<ref name=CBR /><ref>Johnson, Jim. [https://www.cbr.com/legion-of-super-heroes-new-timber-wolf-influenced-by-darick-robertson-wolverine/ "Legion of Super-Heroes' New Timber Wolf Influenced by a Specific Wolverine: Wolverine isn't a surprising inspiration for the Legion of Super-Heroes' Timber Wolf, but there's a classic irony behind it,"] ''CBR'' (AUG. 29, 2019).</ref><ref name=Cronin2>Cronin, Brian. [https://www.cbr.com/wolverine-costume-gallery/ "Wolverine: Every Costume Marvel's Latest Resurrected Mutant Has Worn, Ever,"] ''CBR'' (AUG. 25, 2018).</ref>

He joins the other Imperial Guardsmen in battle against the [[X-Men]] on behalf of Emperor [[D'Ken]] on a nameless Shi'ar Empire planet. He is attacked by [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], who defeats him and strips him of his costume, using it to sneak up on the other Imperial Guardsmen.<ref name="X-Men #107. Marvel Comics" />

Fang later becomes a "Borderer": a Guardsman stationed on one of the Shi'ar's conquered worlds to help its governor enforce Shi'ar law there. Fang and a small number of other Guardsmen become renegades and turn traitor, betraying the Shi'ar Empire by serving [[Deathbird]] in her attempt to overthrow her sister Princess-Majestrix [[Lilandra Neramani|Lilandra]]. This incident involves ''Lord Samedar'' attempting to use some of the outlaw Guard in order to attack the Earth. His faction is opposed by other Shi'ar and the X-Men, the renegade Guardsmen battling the loyal Guardsmen, and Fang fighting [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] during the conflict. The [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] interfere with a concussion-style bomb secretly hidden in the midst of the battle.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #157 (May 1982).</ref>

Soon after this incident, Fang is apparently slain when the Brood uses him as a host body for the egg of one of their young on the "Broodworld", former home-world of the Brood. His body is consumed and transformed by the Brood embryo implanted inside him, and the resulting Brood alien later fights Wolverine, who kills it.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #162 (Oct. 1982).</ref>

When the original Fang is killed, another Lupak, named '''Nev-Darr''', is enlisted to take the place of the original Fang on the Imperial Guard.<ref>''Starjammers'' #4 (Jan. 1996).</ref> When that one is killed a third one takes his place.

In ''Untold Legend of Captain Marvel'' — which takes place before his first encounter with the X-Men — Fang, the Guard, [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]], and the [[Kree]] face an attack by the Brood. A small division of the Guard — [[Starbolt]], [[Smasher (Marvel Comics)|Smasher]], Fang, and Oracle — are selected to guard the personage of [[Deathbird]], the current regent of the Shi'ar empire. They ally, then fight with the Kree, after the latter come to their assistance against a murderous attack from the [[Skrulls]].<ref>''Untold Legend of Captain Marvel'' #1-3 (Apr.–June 1997).</ref>

Fang is seen as loyal Shi'ar warrior when they go to war with the Inhuman-led Kree. One of many battles in this war leads Fang and many others to the base of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]], a giant flowing head called [[Knowhere]].<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #14 (July 2009).</ref>

Fang is one of the many Shi'ar soldiers assigned to team up with the Starjammers to investigate "The Fault," a space-time anomaly that not only threatens Shi'ar space, but all of reality.<ref>''Realm of Kings: Imperial Guard'' #1-5 (2011).</ref>

Fang reappears years later on Earth. He comes to visit Wolverine, only to discover that his "old buddy" [[Death of Wolverine|had died]]. Fang eventually reveals all of his history with Logan to [[X-23]] (Laura Kinney: codename "Wolverine"), revealing how he came back to life after being killed by the Brood. According to Fang, the Lupak reproduce through cloning and keep mental templates of their citizens on file. When one of them dies, a new one is made. He reveals to X-23 that while he is not the Fang Wolverine met back in ''X-Men'' #107, as a clone, he ''is'' still technically the one Wolverine knew.<ref name=Wolverines>''Wolverines'' #11 (May 2015).</ref>

Fang assists the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] and X-23 in stopping a Brood infestation of a scientific facility.<ref>''All-New Wolverine'' #22-24 (2017).</ref>

==Fantasia==
'''Fantasia''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]]. She first appeared in ''Captain America'' #352-353 (April–May 1989), and was created by [[Mark Gruenwald]] and [[Kieron Dwyer]]. The character subsequently appears as '''Fantasma''' beginning in ''The Avengers'' #319-324 (July–Oct. 1990).

Fantasia was a member of the [[Supreme Soviets]]. The team had been sent by the Soviet government to capture the [[Soviet Super-Soldiers]], who were attempting to defect to the United States. Fantasia disguised the team members with an illusion to appear as members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]: [[Red Guardian]] as [[Captain America]], [[Perun (comics)|Perun]] as [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Crimson Dynamo]] as [[Iron Man]], and [[Sputnik (comics)|Sputnik]] as the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]. Eventually, the real Captain America defeated the Supreme Soviets and freed the badly wounded Soviet Super-Soldiers.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Fantasia later changed her name to Fantasma when the team became known as the People's Protectorate.{{Issue|date=April 2010}} Eventually the team broke up and merged with the Soviet Super-Soldiers to form the [[Winter Guard]].{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Fantasma is rescued from a time anomaly by the Winter Guard, with her former teammates of the Protectorate on her trail.<ref>''Darkstar and the Winter Guard'' #1</ref> It is revealed that Fantasma is a [[Dire Wraith]] queen, and she aligns herself with [[Presence (Marvel Comics)|the Presence]] and fights the Winter Guard.<ref>''Darkstar and the Winter Guard'' #2</ref> She is defeated by banishing her into Limbo again.<ref>''Darkstar and the Winter Guard'' #3</ref>

Fantasia is a Russian soldier with super-powers. She is skilled in magic, especially in the use of illusions. She has also shown the ability to fly and certain mental abilities.

Initially, Farrell is interested in reporting on 'real' heroes, such as police officers and firefighters, and did not like being forced to cover superheroes.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Following six supervillain homicides, Farrell is led to murdered judge Michael Hart, who presided solely over superhero crimes. Hart's wife had also been murdered. The police suspect that it was a double homicide or Hart had killed his wife first. Farrell discovers that Hart had been murdered by the [[Tinkerer]]. He had returned, though, with supernatural powers.{{Issue|date=April 2010}} Paul Swanson, fellow reporter, breaks into her apartment and kills her fish in an attempt to scare her off the case. Undeterred, she nevertheless decides to drop the story anyway, to protect Hart.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Farrell also participates in the investigation of fellow journalist Teri Kidder's death,{{Issue|date=April 2010}} and was the first to interview [[Luke Cage]] when he brought the villain [[Green Goblin]] to justice.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

===Other versions of Kat Farrell===
In the "[[House Of M]]" alternate reality, Farrell is still a reporter.<ref>''[[The Pulse (comics)|The Pulse]]'' #10</ref> She wants to write the truth but meets resistance because the ruling mutant class controls the newspapers. At one point she meets [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]], who is aware that reality has been altered.

Connie Ferrari was a well noted New York attorney. She met and started dating Steve Rogers who, unbeknownst to her, was actually [[Captain America]].

The Ferret appeared in six stories during the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]], in ''Marvel Mystery Comics'' #4-9. In 2009, he appeared in the ''Marvel Mystery Comics 70th Anniversary Special'' and several issues of ''[[The Marvels Project]]'', a limited series.

The Ferret aka Leslie Lenrow was a [[New York City]] based private investigator. He often consulted with the police on cases.

In 1940, during a seemingly routine missing persons case, the Ferret and Nosie tailed a Professor Hamilton to a nondescript [[brownstone]]. In reality, Hamilton was a Nazi spy named Albrecht Kerfoot and the brownstone was a meeting place for spies. The Ferret was caught and stabbed in the heart with a dagger. His body was found by the Angel, who adopted his pet ferret and trailed the spies, eventually working with [[Captain America]] and [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky]] to defeat them.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

'''Flashfire''', originally code-named '''Tempest''', is a member of the [[Shi'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (Marvel Comics)|Imperial Guard]]. The character, created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Dave Cockrum]], first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #107 (Oct. 1977). Flashfire can generate and fire bursts of light and electricity. Like many original members of the Imperial Guard, Tempest/Flashfire is the analog of a character from [[DC Comics]]' [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]: in his case [[Lightning Lad]].<ref name=CBR>Cronin, Brian. [https://www.cbr.com/x-men-dark-phoenix-saga-shiar-imperial-guard/ "Comic Legends: Why New Imperial Guard Members in Dark Phoenix Saga?"], ''CBR'' (APR 09, 2018).</ref> Flashfire's alter-ego is Grannz;<ref>{{comicbookdb|type=character|id=7479|title=Tempest (Grannz)}}</ref> Lightning Lad's is Garth Ranzz. At one point, Grannz was engaged to marry fellow Guardsman [[Oracle (Marvel Comics)|Oracle]]<ref name=Inhumans>''Inhumans'' vol. 3 #3 (Aug. 2000).</ref> (an analog of [[Saturn Girl]], to whom Lightning Lad was also romantically linked).

Part of the division of the Imperial Guard known as the Superguardians, Tempest is amongst the first of the Imperial Guard encountered by the team of superhuman mutant adventurers known as the [[X-Men]] who sought to rescue the Princess-Majestrix [[Lilandra Neramani]] from her insane brother, then-Majestor [[D'Ken]].<ref name="X-Men #107. Marvel Comics">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #107. Marvel Comics (Oct. 1977).</ref> After the battle, Lilandra takes over as Majestrix, and the Guard swears allegiance to her.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #122 (June 1979).</ref>

Deathbird's second attempt at a coup is successful, and she becomes Shi'ar Empress. Tempest is with the Guard when they come into conflict with a rogue Space Knight named Pulsar and an alien named Tyreseus. After a large battle which also involves [[Rom the Space Knight|Rom]] and other Space Knights — which leads to the deaths of four new Guardsman — Pulsar and Tyreseus are defeated.<ref name=RomAnnual4>''Rom'' Annual #4 (Dec. 1985).</ref>

Empress Deathbird commands the entire Imperial Guard, including Tempest, to fight the combined forces of the [[Starjammers]] and [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] on Earth so that she can claim the power of the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]] for herself. The Guard are forced to retreat when [[Deathbird]] is put in danger.<ref name=xmsos2>''X-Men: Spotlight on... Starjammers'' #2 (June 1990).</ref> (Some time later [[Skrull|War Skrulls]] impersonating [[Charles Xavier]] and the Starjammers depose Deathbird and restore [[Lilandra Neramani]] to the throne. Deathbird cedes the empire back to Lilandra as she has grown bored of the bureaucracy.)<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #274-277 (Mar.–June 1991).</ref>

Tempest is again part of the mission during [[Operation: Galactic Storm]], an intergalactic war between the Shi'ar and the [[Kree]]. The Imperial Guard are integral to the Sh'iar creating a massive super weapon — the "Nega-Bomb" — using Kree artifacts, including the original [[Mar-Vell|Captain Marvel]]'s [[Nega-Bands]], which the Guard steals from the dead hero's tomb. This bomb is capable of devastating an area equivalent to that of the Kree Empire (which is supposedly located throughout the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]]). Ultimately, the Nega Bomb device is successfully detonated, devastating the Kree Empire, with billions dying instantaneously (98% of the Kree population).<ref>''[[Wonder Man]]'' #9 (May 1992).</ref> The Shi'ar annex the remnants of the Kree Empire, with Deathbird becoming [[viceroy]] of the Kree territories.<ref>''The Avengers'' #347 (May 1992).</ref>

Tempest is renamed '''Flashfire''' in the first issue of the ''Imperial Guard'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]],<ref>''Imperial Guard'' #1 (Jan. 1997).</ref> because of the pre-existing DC character named [[Joshua Clay|Joshua Clay (Tempest)]].

Flashfire has many further adventures with the Imperial Guard, in storylines involving [[Ronan the Accuser]] and the [[Inhumans]],<ref name=Inhumans/><ref>''[[Inhumans]]'' vol. 3 #4 (Oct. 2000).</ref> and such storylines as "[[Emperor Vulcan]],"<ref>''Emperor Vulcan'' #1–5 (Nov. 2007–Mar. 2008).</ref> "Secret Invasion,"<ref>''Secret Invasion: [[Inhumans]]'' #3–4 (Dec. 2008–Jan. 2009).</ref> "[[X-Men: Kingbreaker]],"<ref>''X-Men: Kingbreaker'' #1–4 (Feb.–May 2009).</ref> "[[War of Kings]],"<ref>''War of Kings'' (May–Oct. 2009).</ref> "[[Realm of Kings]],"<ref>''Realm of Kings: Imperial Guard'' #1-5 (Jan.–May 2010).</ref> the "[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]" crossover,<ref>''Infinity'' #1–6 (Oct. 2013–Jan. 2014).</ref> the "Trial of Jean Grey,"<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #13 (May 2014).</ref> "Time Runs Out,"<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 5 #43-44 (June 2015).</ref> and the return of [[Thanos]].<ref>''Thanos'' vol. 2 #3 (Mar. 2017).</ref>

==Freebooter==
'''Freebooter''' (Brandon Cross) is a [[fictional character]] who appeared in the [[Marvel Comics]]' series ''[[A-Next]]''. He was created by [[Tom DeFalco]] and [[Brent Anderson (comics)|Brent Anderson]], and first appeared in ''A-Next'' #4 (1999).

Brandon Cross was a protégé of [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] and [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]]. He was invited to join the "Dream Team" of new [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] who were going to become members of [[A-Next]]. Donning a Hawkeye-like costume, he assumed the guise of the roguish "Freebooter".

Freebooter quickly displayed a tendency to be a "ladies' man" and poured on the charm for teammate [[Cassandra Lang|Stinger]] and found her totally unreceptive to him. Stinger was outraged that new Avengers were being added to the team without her knowledge or permission, and felt no desire to fraternize with the new recruits (especially Freebooter), but in due time Freebooter's fighting skills earned her respect, and his heroic, chivalrous nature her affections. He became a valuable member of the team, but tragedy struck when his close friend and fellow "Dream Teamer" [[Crimson Curse]] was killed in the line of duty. Freebooter lost his carefree attitude and became more withdrawn, but he still fought the forces of evil in her honor.

During the events of [[Last Planet Standing]], Freebooter was badly injured, but received help from the former villain [[Sabreclaw]], whom he later convinced to join A-Next while he was recuperating.<ref>''Avengers Next'' #1</ref> Freebooter later returns to active Avengers duty.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Girl'' #25</ref>

Freebooter has no powers, but has outstanding swordsmanship skills and is an expert archer. His weapon of choice is a retractable bo staff.

}}
'''Carmilla Frost''' is a freedom fighter and member of Killraven's Freemen in a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] [[alternate future]] of the [[Marvel Universe]].

The character, created by [[Don McGregor]] and [[Herb Trimpe]], first appeared in ''[[Amazing Adventures]]'' vol 2, #21 (November 1973) and continued to appear in most issues of the title through #39.

Carmilla is from an alternate-reality Earth run by [[Martian (War of the Worlds)|Martians]]. In 2001, she and her father Andre are taken to the Martians' Yankee Stadium Genetic and Clonal Complex. Andre is blackmailed with threats to his daughter into helping the Martians in performing cloning research. In 2004 she begins assisting her father in his experiments, and eventually becomes an expert molecular biologist. By 2010 she becomes the youngest human designated as a Keeper by the Martians. In 2014 she refuses to conduct cloning experiments on other humans, but two years later, after a Martian Overlord kills Andre, she agrees to clone his corpse in an attempt to restore him to life. Her efforts fail, instead producing the mutated creature Grok. In 2018 she helps [[Killraven]] escape from captivity from the Yankee Stadium Genetic and Clonal Complex and joins his Freemen.{{Issue|date=November 2009}} In 2020 she learns that she is pregnant with the Freeman [[#M'Shulla Scott|M'Shulla]]'s child.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

She and her newborn son Skar are rescued by the cross-reality traveling [[Machine Man]] and [[Howard the Duck]].<ref name=MZ5_2>{{Cite comic |writer = [[Fred Van Lente]] |penciller = [[Kano (comics)|Kano]] |story = |title = [[Marvel Zombies 5]] |issue = #2 |date = June 2010 |publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref>

==Christian Frost==
'''Christian Frost''' is the brother of Cordelia, [[Adrienne Frost|Adrienne]] and [[Emma Frost]]. He was created by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Phil Jimenez]] and made his first appearance in ''[[New X-Men (2001 series)|New X-Men]]'' #139 (June 2003).

Not wanting anything to do with the family business, Christian often clashed with his father Winston. When Winston learned that his son was gay, he threatened to disown him and forced Christian to dump his then-boyfriend and move into the family home with him. Christian refused and cut ties with his entire family, only remaining in contact with Emma, his closest confidante. In retaliation, Winston used his power to have Christian's boyfriend deported, leading Christian to develop a substance abuse problem as a way to cope with the resulting depression. As his addiction worsened, a concerned Emma asked their father to help him get clean and Winston gladly welcomed his son back before turning on him and locking him in a mental institution in order to "cure" him of being gay once Emma had left. Following the conversion therapy, Christian was released and reinstated as the heir to the Frost business. Christian subsequently murdered Winston as revenge for the years of abuse his father had subjected him to and took over his business empire.

After becoming suspicious that her father had appointed Christian as heir to the business, Emma visited his mansion and was greeted by her father. Demanding to see Christian, Winston refused and exhibited never-before-seen psychic powers to force her to retreat. Worried for her brother's safety, Emma approaches [[Iceman (Marvel Comics)|Iceman]] and he agrees to help rescue Christian from her father. When they return to the mansion, they fight through several psychic apparitions before discovering Winston's body in his study. While Iceman buys her time, Emma reaches out and discovers that Christian is the one causing the apparitions, including that of their father. Emma's attempts to reach Christian's mind were in vain as, in the midst of a mental breakdown causing him to lose control of his powers, Christian was unable to hear her. As the Frost siblings are unable to directly infiltrate each other's minds, Emma creates a telepathic link between Iceman and Christian, allowing them to communicate. Iceman, having recently been outed, empathises with Christian's homophobic experiences and manages to calm him down enough for him to regain control. Emma thanks Iceman and decides to stay with her brother to help him come to terms with what has happened and get him back on his feet.<ref>''Iceman'' vol. 3 #1–2</ref>

After the mutant nation of [[List of Marvel Comics characters: K#Krakoa|Krakoa]] is formed, Emma re-establishes the [[The Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] as the Hellfire Trading Company which aims to help distribute supplies in service of mutants, with Emma once again as its White Queen. Emma brings Christian into the fold, appointing him as her '''White Bishop'''. Christian begins to become closer with Iceman through his work for the Company and the two begin a casual relationship.<ref>''Marauders #4-5''</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
Unlike his siblings, Christian's psychic powers did not emerge when he was younger and appear to have developed much more recently. He has the ability to draw upon and materialize energy from the astral plane and create Avatars of energy constructs or project it as a destructive psionic energy blast which causes both physical and mental damage. His newly manifested abilities are extremely powerful, as his projection of Winston was robust enough to convince Emma, herself a particularly advanced telepath, that it was her actual father.

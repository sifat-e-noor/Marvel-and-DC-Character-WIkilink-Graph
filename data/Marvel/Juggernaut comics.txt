'''Juggernaut''' ('''Cain Marko''') is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =[[The Encyclopedia of Super-Villains]] |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=172}}</ref> Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-writer [[Jack Kirby]], he first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #12 (July 1965) as an adversary of the [[X-Men|eponymous superhero team]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=201}}</ref> Since then, he has come into conflict with other heroes, primarily [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Hulk]].

Cain Marko is a regular human who was empowered by a gem belonging to the deity [[Cyttorak]], becoming a literal human [[juggernaut]]. He possesses superhuman strength and durability, and is virtually immune to most physical attacks; his helmet also protects him from mental attacks. Although not a mutant, Juggernaut has been featured as a prominent member of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]]. He is also the stepbrother of [[Professor X]].

Since his debut during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], the character has appeared in over five decades of Marvel publications, featuring prominently in the [[X-Men]] titles and starring in two [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] solo publications. The character has also been associated with Marvel merchandise including [[clothing]], [[toy]]s, [[trading card]]s, [[animated]] [[television series]], [[video game]]s. [[Vinnie Jones]] played Juggernaut in the 2006 film ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'', while [[Ryan Reynolds]] provided [[motion capture]] and [[voice acting]] for the [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] character in the 2018 film ''[[Deadpool 2]]''. In some reinterpretations (most notably the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]]), Marko is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who was born with his powers, while in others they simply come from his costume.

In 2008, Juggernaut was ranked 188th on ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'''s list of Top 200 Comic Book Characters.<ref>[http://www.wizarduniverse.com/051308top200characters2.html "The Top 200 Comic Book Greatest Characters of All Time, Part 2"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603030126/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/051308top200characters2.html |date=2008-06-03 }}, May 13, 2008 {{Dead link|date=July 2022}}.

==Publication history==
[[File:JuggernautDebut.jpg|175px|thumb|left|Juggernaut's debut in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|The X-Men]]'' #12. Art by [[Jack Kirby]].]]
The character debuted as an antagonist of the eponymous mutant superhero team in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #12–13 (July & September 1965).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=108}}</ref> In the first of these issues, he rampaged unseen throughout the X-Men's headquarters while the team's leader, [[Professor X]], related the character's origin in a series of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s.

After an initial defeat in the following issue, the Juggernaut returned in ''X-Men'' #32–33 (May–June 1967), and returned again in ''X-Men'' #46 (July 1968), then fought the sorcerer [[Doctor Strange]] in ''Doctor Strange'' #182 (September 1969), X-Men member the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] in ''Amazing Adventures'' #16 (January 1973), and the [[Hulk]] in ''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #172 (February 1974).

After the canceled ''X-Men'' returned in the mid-1970s, the Juggernaut returned to fight a new iteration of the team in ''X-Men'' #101–103 (October 1975–February 1976). Storylines in ''[[Spider-Woman]]'' #37–38 (April & June 1981) and ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #229–230 (June–July 1982) explored the Juggernaut's relationship with his ally [[Black Tom Cassidy]].

The X-Men and Spider-Man proved to be regular foes for the character, who appeared in ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #183 (July 1984), ''Marvel Team-up'' #150 (February 1985), and ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #194 (June 1985). The Juggernaut guest-starred in ''[[Secret Wars II]]'' #7 (January 1986), battled a new generation of mutants in ''X-Men'' #217–218 (April & June 1987), appeared in a flashback story in ''[[Marvel Saga]]'' #21 (August 1987), and in a humorous episode in ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' #3 (December 1988).

The Juggernaut also participated in the "[[Acts of Vengeance]]" storyline in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' #411–412 (December 1989) and returned in ''Thor'' #429 (February 1991). Other appearances included an encounter with his creator, [[Cyttorak]], in ''[[X-Men Unlimited]]'' #12 (September 1996) and starring in the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] issue ''Juggernaut'' #1 (April 1997).

In 1994 Marvel purchased [[Malibu Comics]] and began a series of crossovers that saw Marvel characters entering the Malibu Ultraverse. In 1995–1996, Juggernaut lead a group of Ultras, who were named The All New Exiles. The All New Exiles met up with the X-Men in a special Malibu/Marvel collaboration, ''The All New Exiles vs X-Men'' #0, dated October 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/marvel-avengers-seventh-infinity-stone-ultraverse-nemesis/|title=The Secret History of Marvel's Seventh Infinity Stone|last=Cronin|first=Brian|website=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=March 12, 2019|access-date=July 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190313041554/https://www.cbr.com/marvel-avengers-seventh-infinity-stone-ultraverse-nemesis/|archive-date=March 13, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

The character appeared in ''Juggernaut: The Eighth Day'' #1 (November 1999) and ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' vol. 3 #23–25 (December 1999–February 2000) with similarly powered [[Incarnation|avatars]] and attempted a reformation in ''The Uncanny X-Men'' # 410–413 (September–December 2002) and ''X-Men'' #162–164 (November 2004–January 2005). The Juggernaut confronted his stepbrother, Charles Xavier&mdash;leader of the X-Men&mdash;in ''X-Men: Legacy'' #219 (February 2009), and fought the Hulk in ''Hulk'' #602 (November 2009).

He appeared as a regular character in ''Thunderbolts'' beginning with issue #144, and remained on the team until issue #158, during the ''Fear Itself'' limited series.

Juggernaut had a solo comic in 2020, by [[Fabian Nicieza]] and [[Ron Garney]]. Despite being a character from the X-Men franchise, it has plots of its own that do not crossover with the ongoing ''[[Dawn of X]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cbr.com/marvel-juggernaut-new-helmet-first-look/|title= Marvel's Juggernaut Debuts His New Helmet in Issue 1 First Look|author= Collier Jennings|date= August 26, 2020|publisher= CBR|access-date=November 22, 2020}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===1960s===
Cain Marko is the son of Kurt Marko, who becomes Charles Xavier's stepfather when he marries Sharon Xavier after the death of her husband Brian, for which Kurt is partially responsible. Kurt Marko favors Charles and abuses his own son, Cain. Cain resents Charles and bullies him frequently. Cain Marko and his step-brother Charles serve in the [[US Army]] and are stationed in [[Korea]]. Marko finds a hidden temple dedicated to the entity [[Cyttorak]]. On entering, Marko finds and holds a huge [[ruby]] and reads the inscription on the stone aloud: "Whosoever touches this gem shall be granted the power of the Crimson Gem of Cyttorak! Henceforth, you who read these words, shall become ... forevermore ... a human juggernaut!" The gem channels Cyttorak's power into Marko. The transformation causes a [[cave-in]], and the character is buried and presumably killed, not being heard from again until a sudden assault on the X-Men's headquarters.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Comtois |first1=Pierre |title=Marvel Comics in the 1960s: An Issue By Issue Field Guide to a Pop Culture Phenomenon |date=2015 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1-60549-016-8 |pages=86–87}}</ref>

Xavier recounts the Juggernaut's origin to the X-Men, and after shrugging off the mansion's defenses and brushing aside the X-Men, Marko is seen clearly in the final panel as he confronts Xavier. The X-Men regroup and attack, while Xavier summons [[Fantastic Four]] member the [[Human Torch]] to aid the [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]]s; the Torch generates 'pulses' of flame that essentially hypnotize the Juggernaut, distracting him long enough for [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] to remove his helmet, making Marko susceptible to a [[telepath]]ic attack by Xavier.<ref>''X-Men'' #12-13 (July & Sept. 1965). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Juggernaut returns seeking revenge and is delayed by three of the X-Men while [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]], aided by the [[:wikt:Astral|astral]] form of mystic [[Doctor Strange]], find and use another jewel of Cyttorak, which banishes the Juggernaut to the "Crimson Cosmos", the home dimension of Cyttorak.<ref>''X-Men'' #32-33 (May–June 1967). Marvel Comics.</ref> When the Juggernaut reappears, the character has gained mystical abilities and briefly battles the mystic [[Doctor Strange]] before being banished to an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] by the cosmic entity [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]].<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #182 (Sept. 1969). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===1970s===
Juggernaut reappears on Earth through sheer force of will, although the alien dimension caused him to age rapidly. The panicking villain battles former X-Man the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] before being drawn back to the same dimension.<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #16 (Jan. 1973). Marvel Comics.</ref> An entity from his prison dimension reverses the aging process and removes the mystical powers on the proviso that the villain never return. The Juggernaut is accidentally pulled back to Earth at the [[Hulkbusters|Hulkbuster]] base by an interdimensional device designed to banish the Hulk. The Hulk aids the Juggernaut in escaping from the base but attacks him when the Juggernaut threatens a civilian. During the battle, the Juggernaut's helmet is removed, and he is surprised and defeated by Professor X, Cyclops, and Marvel Girl.<ref name="Hulk #172 Feb. 1974">''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #172 (Feb. 1974). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Juggernaut befriends [[Black Tom Cassidy]], the cousin of X-Man [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], and battles the first generation of new X-Men. When Tom falls off the battlements of Cassidy Keep after a sword duel with Banshee, Juggernaut jumps after him into the sea.<ref>''X-Men'' #101-103 (Oct; Dec & Feb. 1976). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===1980s===
Black Tom uses his niece [[Siryn]], who possesses the same powers as her father [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], to steal a shipment of the metal [[vibranium]]. The Juggernaut battles [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] and the X-Men and is the only one of the criminal trio to escape capture.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #37-38 (April & June 1981).

On arriving in [[New York City]], Tom sends the Juggernaut [[Nothing Can Stop the Juggernaut!|to capture Madame Web]]; Juggernaut destroys several city blocks in the process, and ignores [[Spider-Man]]'s best efforts to stop him. He almost kills Web by accident when he removes her from a life support device, and abandons her. A frustrated Spider-Man lures the Juggernaut into setting concrete, poured for the foundation of an office high-rise, into which he sinks without a trace;<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #229-230 (June–July 1982).

The Juggernaut also stars in a solo story<ref>''Juggernaut'' #1 (April 1997). Marvel Comics.</ref> and the "Eighth Day" storyline, which introduces the entities the [[Exemplars (comics)|Exemplars]].

===2000s===
The Juggernaut, courtesy of a ruse engineered by Black Tom Cassidy, allies with and joins the X-Men; the plan is to destroy the team from within. When Cassidy openly betrays the Juggernaut, Marko attempts to change his ways and joins the X-Men.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2018/10/16/marvel-comics-full-solicitations-for-january-2019/|title=Marvel Comics Full Solicitations for January 2019|first=Rich|last=Johnston|date=October 16, 2018|website=Bleeding Cool News And Rumors}}</ref><ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #410 - 411 (Oct. 2002); #412 (Nov. 2002).

An enraged Juggernaut attacks Cassidy and his allies, and the battle strands all participants in the [[Mojo (comics)|Mojoverse]].<ref>''X-Men'' #162-164 (Nov. 2004 – Jan. 2005). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Juggernaut reappears and joins the team ''[[Excalibur (comics)#New Excalibur (2005–2007)|New Excalibur]]'' for a brief period. One storyline expands on the Juggernaut's origin and reveals that Marko is only the most recent of a series of incarnations of Cyttorak's avatar; each battles a challenger to the death for the right to retain the entity's power.<ref>''New Excalibur'' #13 - 15 (Jan. - March 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the ''[[World War Hulk]]'' storyline, the Juggernaut's power begins to wane, but by shunning his stepbrother Xavier and returning to his villainous nature, he is able to restore the link with Cyttorak, becoming powerful enough to hold his own against the Hulk.<ref>''World War Hulk; X-Men'' #1–3 (Aug.–Oct. 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref> Despite an attempt by Xavier to reform Marko, he concedes that redemption is impossible.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #219 (Feb. 2009). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===2010s===
{{long plot|section|date=April 2017}}
While training his son [[Skaar (comics)|Skaar]], Bruce Banner bombs Juggernaut's house to initiate a confrontation between Skaar and the Juggernaut.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #601</ref> Skaar manages to win his first fight by throwing the Juggernaut into open space, proving to his father that he has the ability to use cunning and strategy in combat, and not simply physical strength.<ref name="Incredible Hulk #602">''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #602. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During ''[[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt|The Gauntlet]]'' storyline, Spider-Man finds the [[Nothing Can Stop the Juggernaut!#Something Can Stop the Juggernaut|Juggernaut unconscious]]. The government comes along and transports the Juggernaut to a secure facility. Spider-Man sneaks into the facility to ask the Juggernaut who did this to him. Then, a new [[Captain Universe]] breaks into the room and claims he's there to slay the Juggernaut.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #627. Marvel Comics.</ref> Spider-Man learns that Captain Universe is a man named William Nguyen who wants revenge on Juggernaut for ruining his life during [[Nothing Can Stop the Juggernaut!|his previous fight with Spider-Man]] over Madame Web.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #628">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #628. Marvel Comics.</ref> When he insists on trying to kill Juggernaut instead of fixing the tectonic plates beneath New York City, the Uni-Power leaves Nguyen and enters the Juggernaut. The Juggernaut, as Captain Universe, repairs the damage to the tectonic plates that was caused by him during the same rampage that ruined Nguyen's life.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #629"/>

Following the ''[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]'' storyline, Juggernaut is shown at The Raft at the start of the ''[[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]]'' storyline – weakened, since Cyttorak apparently took his temporary empowerment by the Uni-Power as an affront and withheld part of his "blessing". Following [[Luke Cage]]'s appointment as leader of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], Cain is brought up for suggestion for the program. While Cage is initially against his joining, Professor X telepathically contacts Luke and asks him to reconsider, believing he has a chance at redemption despite what he previously told Cain. Juggernaut agrees to do whatever Luke says, partly because he is now suffused with nanomachines which can affect him in his weakened state.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #144. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, one of the seven Hammers of the Worthy that was launched to Earth by [[Serpent (comics)|Serpent]]: God of Fear lands near Juggernaut. Juggernaut lifts it and becomes Kuurth: Breaker of Stone. His transformation is enough to level the Raft, causing a mass prison break.<ref>''Fear Itself'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Kuurth makes his way to California and fights the X-Men. Magik, Colossus, and Shadowcat go to Cyttorak's dimension and inform it that the Serpent has control over Juggernaut. Magik strikes a deal with Cyttorak, who chooses her to become the new host of the Juggernaut's powers. However, the entity transfers the Juggernaut's powers to Colossus instead. Colossus is able to turn the tide on Kuurth before Kuurth is teleported away by the Serpent.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #540–542. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the last battle between the Avengers and the Worthy, Kuurth is defeated by Wolverine using his Uru armor and loses his hammer when the Serpent is killed by Thor.<ref>''Fear Itself'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Cain Marko, apparently having been incarcerated after the events of ''Fear Itself'', having lost the power of both Kuurth and Cyttorak (but retaining his enormous physique) is released into military custody. Subsequently, he is taken to the borders of the country of Sharzhad just as the Thunderbolts return from their tumultuous tumble through time, and Satana aids Man-Thing in opening a gateway to the Crimson Cosmos (or possibly an alternate universe where Cain Marko had died while still the Juggernaut). Pushing his hand through, Marko is re-empowered, becoming the Juggernaut once more, just in time to thunder forth and smash through the otherwise unbreakable force field surrounding the country. This allows the Thunderbolts to resolve an otherwise deadly threat to the planet, as had been orchestrated by the Ghost, who had sent the request for Marko's release back through time.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #182. Marvel Comics.</ref> He soon loses these borrowed powers again and lives in solitude in the desert, still, it seems, super-strong, although not mystically-empowered.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #183. Marvel Comics.</ref> Meanwhile, Magik purges the Juggernaut powers from Colossus with her Soulsword.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 2 #20. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After a time, Cyttorak causes the Crimson Gem to reappear in the ancient temple and emit a call for suitable candidates to become a new Juggernaut. Cain Marko, finally having found peace—even tending a vegetable garden—senses the call and, having armed himself, coerces the [[Vanisher]] to take him to the Gem's location. He comes into conflict with a team of X-Men (having been alerted by Colossus, who also perceived the call), as well as seekers of the Juggernaut's power such as [[Man-Killer]]. Marko and Colossus struggle with one another, only to realize that they have the same goal—to destroy the Crimson Gem and prevent another avatar being empowered. Ahmet Adbol, the former [[Living Monolith]], claims the Gem and is transformed into an amalgam of Living Monolith and Juggernaut.<ref>''Amazing X-Men'' vol. 2 #16–17. Marvel Comics.</ref> As the colossal new Juggernaut wreaks havoc in the countryside, Colossus invokes Cyttorak, and the god responds to his former exemplar. Arguing that the Monolith-Juggernaut will eventually fail Cyttorak, as all his former avatars have done, Colossus challenges him to try something new: empower him enough to kill Cyttorak himself. Apparently daunted by this prospect, the god withdraws his power from Ahmet Abdol and instead empowers another avatar, to a greater extent than any Juggernaut has ever been. However, the new avatar is not Colossus, but once more Cain Marko. Marko is full of rage, which he focuses on the X-Men and specifically Cyclops (who isn't even present), for killing Professor Xavier. Now more powerful than ever and stripped of even his last weaknesses, he feels that Charles Xavier was the only one who ever truly believed in Cain Marko. Colossus attempts to battle the empowered Juggernaut, but dodges Cain's blows rather than fighting him head on. Peter "cheats" and strikes the sea side cliff edge where they had been fighting, causing Cain to fall into the ocean below. However, he is seen rising from the waves once again.<ref>''Amazing X-Men'' vol. 2 #18–19. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Juggernaut and Black Tom resurface attacking a luxury yacht, but they are confronted by the time-displaced [[All-New X-Men|young X-Men]], with Jean knocking Black Tom out while Beast - who has been training in magic - creates a dimensional portal that passes through Hell before sending Juggernaut to Siberia.<ref>''X-Men: Blue'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Cain next appears in ''Iceman'' #5, still looking for those responsible who killed his step-brother Charles Xavier. He runs into Iceman, who is having family issues of his own. Bobby, thankful for the distraction, engages Cain. At the end of the fight, Iceman encases Juggernaut in an ice cage and rockets him into the nearby river via ice elevator sling-shot. Then he creates some ice simulacrum that carry/swim him down river, removing Cain from the area altogether.<ref>''Iceman'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

A continuation where ''Iceman'' #5 left off, Cain is apprehended by S.H.I.E.L.D. and is being flown to a secure location but gets accidentally summoned by Dr. Voodoo to the X-Mansion. Cain fights a mixed team of veterans (Rogue, Quicksilver, Wanda, Dr. Voodoo & Wasp) and newbie (Quicksilver's latest girl-friend: Synapse). Once Juggernaut has engaged them, Rogue power punches him away from the team to give them more space. Quicksilver attempts to finish the fight quickly by racing Synapse over to Cain to get his helmet off so she can mentally neutralize him. Pietro quickly gets the helmet off but finds out Cain's wearing a mental protection skull cap underneath. Cain subsequently attacks Synapse, almost killing her. More battle ensues and Dr. Voodoo sends his summoned Cyttorak minions to "fix" Cain's armor and thus "sealing" him inside his armor. The little Cyttorak builders then carry Cain back into Cyttorak's realm and Doctor Voodoo closes the portal.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' vol. 3 #29. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "Sins Rising" arc, Juggernaut is shown to be an inmate at Ravencroft. Using [[Mister Negative]]'s powers to corrupt the clone of [[Ashley Kafka]], a revived [[Sin-Eater (comics)|Sin-Eater]] steals Juggernaut's powers.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man: The Sins of Norman Osborn'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Sinister War]]" storyline, [[Harry Osborn#Kindred|Kindred]] revived Sin-Eater again and one of the demonic centipedes that emerged from his body took possession of Juggernaut making him one of the members of the Sinful Six.<ref>''Sinister War'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
[[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] describes Juggernaut as "the closest thing on Earth to an irresistible force".<ref name="xmenv1no183">''Uncanny X-Men'' #183 (July 1984)</ref> When Cain Marko finds the stone of mystical entity [[Cyttorak]], he is empowered with magical energies and transformed into an immortal [[Incarnation|avatar]] for the entity in question.<ref>''Juggernaut: The 8th Day''; ''The Avengers'' vol. 3, #24-25 (Jan.-Feb. 2000). Marvel Comics.</ref> As the Juggernaut, Marko possesses superhuman strength, being capable of shattering mountains,<ref name="Hulk #172 Feb. 1974"/> lifting and using buildings as weapons,<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #361 (Nov. 1998). Marvel Comics.</ref> and extreme durability.<ref name="Thor #429 Feb. 1991"/>

Juggernaut is able to generate a mystical [[force shield|force field]] that grants him additional [[invulnerability]] to any physical attack when it is at its maximum,<ref name="X-Men #13 Sept. 1965">''X-Men'' #13 (Sept. 1965). Marvel Comics.</ref> including [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]'s punches.{{r|xmenv1no183}} Even when the force field is temporarily absorbed by Thor's hammer, the Juggernaut's natural durability still proves to be great enough to withstand blows from Thor.<ref name="Thor #429 Feb. 1991"/> The Juggernaut is described as physically unstoppable once in motion,<ref name="X-Men #13 Sept. 1965"/> does not tire from physical activity, and is able to survive without food, water, or oxygen. The Juggernaut heals quickly, as when he was stabbed through the eyes by [[Shatterstar]], the wounds were healed almost immediately.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #16</ref>

It is possible for an opponent with sufficient physical or mystical strength of their own to turn the Juggernaut's unstoppable movement against him, by redirecting his motion so that he gets stranded in a position in which he has no escape; both the Hulk and his son, Skaar, have done this physically,<ref name="Incredible Hulk #602"/> and Thor has done it mystically with [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)|Mjolnir]].<ref>''World War Hulk: X-Men'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Thor'' #412. Marvel Comics.</ref> The only character to have stopped Juggernaut while he was in motion as an act of pure physical strength was the Hulk while he was War, a horseman of Apocalypse and empowered with Celestial technology.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #457. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Marko gains complete access to the Gem's powers during the Trion saga, it increases his power a thousandfold. Trion Juggernaut is capable of altering the size of matter, growing in size, tracking, levitation, absorbing and projecting energy, increasing his own strength, and creating portals through space-time.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #369. Marvel Comics.</ref> Conversely, when Marko once shared the Gem's power with his best friend, [[Black Tom Cassidy|Black Tom]], the power it bestowed upon them both was halved, making them more vulnerable to attacks from Spider-Man and the X-Men.<ref name="Marvel Team-Up' 1985"/>

The character is vulnerable to [[telepathy|mental attacks]], a weakness that has been exploited via the removal of his helmet, which normally protects him from such.<ref name="X-Men #13 Sept. 1965"/> The Juggernaut has circumvented this weakness on occasion by wearing a metal [[Capeline|skullcap]] inside his main helmet.<ref name="Marvel Team-Up' 1985"/> If Juggernaut loses his helmet, he can magically recreate it from available raw materials (as long as he possesses the full power of the gem).<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #628"/>

After Cyttorak's re-empowering of Cain Marko, his strength and durability were raised to higher levels than ever before, and his vulnerability to mental attacks was negated.<ref>''Amazing X-Men'' vol. 2 #19. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===What If?===
There are two different stories of "[[What If? (comics)|What If]]" that revolve around Juggernaut:

*In a reality where Xavier acquires the Crimson Gem rather than Cain, Cain joins forces with [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] and Xavier's disillusioned students, the X-Men. Believing that Xavier's more ruthless methods contradict his alleged dream of peaceful co-existence and using a telepathy-blocking headband to prevent Xavier from realizing what he is up to, they expel the Juggernaut into space. Cain leaves with Magneto after Xavier's Juggernaut is dispatched.<ref>''What If?'' vol. 2 #13</ref>
*In ''What if?'' vol. 2 #94, in a reality where Cain successfully defeats the X-Men in their first battle, the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] are thus released in mass numbers without the X-Men to oppose them, resulting in Earth's destruction in their subsequent assault. Although Cain eventually destroys the Sentinels through sheer persistence, he is left alone wandering in a post-apocalyptic wasteland with all other humans, and even animals, having been killed by the radiation released by the Sentinels. In his eagerness for human company, he also unintentionally destroys a hidden enclave of humans and mutants conserved by Magneto.<ref>''What If?'' vol. 2 #94. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
[[File:Ultjugg.jpg|150px|right|thumb|"Ultimate Juggernaut", from ''[[Ultimate X-Men Annual]]'' #1 (August 2005).<br>Art by [[Tom Raney]].]]

During the ''[[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|Ultimatum]]'' storyline, Juggernaut helps Rogue in defending the X-Mansion from anti-mutant soldiers led by [[William Stryker]].

===Film===
{{main|X-Men (film series)}}
[[File:Juggsmovie.PNG|175px|thumb|[[Vinnie Jones]] as the Juggernaut in ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]''.]]
* In the first script for the film ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'', written by [[Andrew Kevin Walker]], the Juggernaut was going to be a member of [[Magneto (film character)|Magneto]]'s [[Brotherhood of Mutants]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/x-men_walker3.html|title="X-Men," by Andrew Kevin Walker|website=www.dailyscript.com}}</ref> However, this was scrapped when Walker rewrote the script.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}
* The Juggernaut appears in ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'', portrayed by [[Vinnie Jones]]. This version serves as a member of Magneto's Brotherhood and a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the inability to be halted once he starts running and superhuman strength sufficient to fight [[Logan (film series character)|Wolverine]] to a standstill. Additionally, he possesses no explicit connection to [[Charles Xavier (film character)|Charles Xavier]] or the Gem of Cyttorak. During the Brotherhood's final battle with the [[X-Men]], Magneto orders the Juggernaut to destroy a mutant cure, but the latter is foiled by [[Kitty Pryde]] and knocks himself out when he attempts to run through a wall while in the presence of the power-negating [[Leech (comics)|Leech]]. Jones has said he would like to reprise the role in a spin-off, as he felt there was too little time in ''The Last Stand'' for him to imbue the character with depth.
* The Juggernaut was originally written to appear in ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'', portrayed [[Josh Helman]].

==Internet parody==
On February 14, 2006, the parody troupe My Way Entertainment released "The Juggernaut Bitch!!", an [[overdubbing|overdub]] of part of the ''[[X-Men: The Animated Series|X-Men]]'' animated TV series episode "[[List of X-Men episodes|Phoenix Saga (Part 3): The Cry of the Banshee]]". "The Juggernaut Bitch!!" uses a variety of [[slang]], [[profanity]] and [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non sequitur]]s through ad-libbing. The parody includes the often-repeated line, "Don't you know who the fuck I am? I'm the Juggernaut, bitch!" At first, the clip was made available on the duo's college website, but when [[YouTube]] became popular, so did the parody.

The [[internet meme]] became so popular that the line was included in ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' during Juggernaut's fight with [[Kitty Pryde]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1532557/x-men-last-stand-secrets-revealed.jhtml |title=Nine Things You Need to Know Before Seeing 'X-Men' This Weekend |last=Carroll |first=Larry |date=26 May 2006 |publisher=[[MTV News]] |access-date=28 December 2012}}</ref> In June 2006, My Way released a [[sequel]], "J2: Juggment Day", using footage from the episode "Juggernaut Returns".

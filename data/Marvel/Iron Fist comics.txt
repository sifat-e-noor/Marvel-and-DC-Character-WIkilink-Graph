'''Iron Fist''' ('''Daniel Thomas''' "'''Danny'''" '''Rand''') is a [[fiction]]al [[Character (arts)|character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Gil Kane]], Iron Fist first appeared in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #15 (May 1974). The character is a practitioner of [[martial arts]] and the wielder of a mystical force known as the Iron Fist, which allows him to summon and focus his ''[[Qi|chi]]''. This ability is obtained from the city of [[Kunlun (mythology)|K'un-Lun]] which appears on earth every 10 years.

He starred in his own solo series in the 1970s, and shared the title ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist]]'' for several years with [[Luke Cage]], partnering with Cage to form the superhero team [[Heroes for Hire]]. Rand frequently appeared with the [[Daughters of the Dragon]] duo [[Misty Knight]] and [[Colleen Wing]] – with Rand often seen in a relationship with the former, marking the first interracial romance in Marvel Comics history. The character has starred in numerous solo titles since, including ''[[The Immortal Iron Fist]]'', which expanded on his origin story and the history of the Iron Fist.

Iron Fist has been adapted to appear in several animated television series and video games. [[Finn Jones]] portrayed [[Danny Rand (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|the character]] in the live-action [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) [[Netflix]] [[Netflix's Marvel television series|television series]] ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]'' (2016–2018), ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'' (2017), and the [[Luke Cage (season 2)|second season]] of ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]''.

Iron Fist, along with the previously created [[Shang-Chi]], Master of Kung Fu, came from [[Marvel Comics]] during an American [[popular culture|pop culture]] trend in the early to mid-1970s of [[martial arts]] heroes. Writer/co-creator [[Roy Thomas]] wrote in a text piece in ''Marvel Premiere'' #15 that Iron Fist's origin and creation owe much to the [[Bill Everett]] character, [[Amazing-Man (Centaur Publications)|John Aman, the Amazing-Man]], created in 1939. Thomas later wrote that he and artist/co-creator [[Gil Kane]] had

{{blockquote|...started "Iron Fist" because I'd seen my first [[kung fu]] movie, even before a [[Bruce Lee]] one came out, and it had a thing called "the ceremony of the Iron Fist" in it. I thought that was a good name, and we already had ''[[Master of Kung Fu (comics)|Master of Kung Fu]]'' going, but I thought, "Maybe a superhero called Iron Fist, even though we had [[Iron Man]], would be a good idea." [Publisher] Stan [Lee] liked the name, so I got hold of Gil and he brought in his Amazing Man influences, and we designed the character together...<ref>{{Cite journal | journal=[[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]] | issue=70 | date=July 2007| title=Roy Thomas interview | page=38}}</ref>}}

The film mentioned by Thomas is ''[[King Boxer]]'', aka ''Five Fingers of Death'' (1972), which presents the ''Iron Fist'' technique.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vocal.media/geeks/two-fisted-tales-the-untold-origin-of-the-comic-book-superhero-iron-fist|title=Two-Fisted Tales: The Untold Origin of the Comic Book Superhero Iron Fist|website=Geeks|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref> Thomas further discussed the character's creation stating, "When Stan Lee gave me a verbal approval to star him in a series, I contacted Gil Kane and we worked out the costume and story.  I had Gil give him a dragon brand on his chest, inspired by the one branded into Bullseye, a great western character created by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]].  At Gil's urging, we took some story elements from [[Bill Everett]]'s 1939 hero Amazing-Man, which itself had borrowed heavily from [[James Hilton (novelist)|James Hilton]]'s novel [[Lost Horizon]] and the first movie made from it, which introduced "[[Shangri-La]]" to the world."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://hero-envy.blogspot.com/2020/01/the-roy-thomas-marvel-comics-characters_1.html | title="Hero Envy" the Blog Adventures: THE ROY THOMAS MARVEL COMICS CHARACTERS, CONCEPTS AND CREATIONS PART 1 | date=January 2020 }}</ref>

==Publication history==
Debuting in a story written by Thomas and [[pencilled]] by Kane in the umbrella title ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #15–25 (May 1974 – October 1975), he was then written successively by [[Len Wein]], [[Doug Moench]], [[Tony Isabella]], and [[Chris Claremont]], with art by successive pencillers [[Larry Hama]], [[Arvell Jones]], [[Pat Broderick]], and, in some of his earliest professional work, [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]. As the ''Marvel Premiere'' issues had successfully established a considerable readership for the character,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Brennaman|first=Chris |title=Marvel Premiere|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=71|page=25 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=April 2014|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> following this run, Iron Fist was immediately spun off into the solo series ''Iron Fist'', which ran 15 issues (November 1975 – September 1977). The solo series was written by Claremont and pencilled by Byrne. A subplot involving the [[Steel Serpent]] left unresolved by the cancellation of the series was wrapped up in issues #63–64 of ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', the latter of which featured Rand kiss [[Misty Knight]], marking the first interracial kiss and first long-term interracial couple in [[Marvel Comics]] history, as well as the first couple with an age difference in which the woman was older than her man.{{cn|date=August 2022}}

To rescue the character from cancellation, Marvel paired Iron Fist with another character who was no longer popular enough to sustain his own series, [[Luke Cage]].<ref name="back45">{{cite journal |last=Callahan |first=Timothy |date=December 2010 |title=Power Man and Iron Fist |journal=[[Back Issue!]] |issue=45 |pages= 3–11 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> The two characters were partnered in a three-part story in Cage's series ''Power Man'' #48–50. The title of the series changed to ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist]]'' with issue #50 (April 1978), although the [[Indicia (publishing)|indicia]] did not reflect this change until issue #67. Iron Fist co-starred in the series until the final issue (#125, September 1986). Writer Jim Owsley (subsequently known as [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Christopher Priest]]) later commented, "Fist's death was senseless and shocking and completely unforeseen. It took the readers' heads clean off. And, to this day, people are mad about it. Forgetting, it seems, that (a) you were supposed to be mad, that death is senseless and Fist's death was supposed to be senseless, or that (b) this is a comic book."<ref name="back45"/>

Iron Fist was revived half a decade later in ''[[Namor]], the Sub-Mariner'' #21–25 (December 1991 – April 1992), a story which revealed that the character killed in ''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #125 was a [[doppelgänger]]. The story was both written and drawn by Byrne, who found the manner of Iron Fist's death objectionable and later commented, "In one of those amazing examples of Marvel serendipity, it turned out to be fairly easy not only to resurrect Danny, but to make it seem like that was the plan all along."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lantz|first=James Heath |title=Prince Namor the Sub-Mariner: Scion of the Deep or Royal Pain?|journal=[[Back Issue!]] |issue=91|pages=57–58 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=September 2016|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> Iron Fist then became a frequently starring character in the anthology series ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'', featuring in three multi-part [[story arc]]s and four one-shot stories in 1992 and 1993. Two solo [[miniseries]] followed: ''Iron Fist'' (vol. 2) #1–2 (September–October 1996), by writer [[James Felder]] and penciller Robert Brown; and ''Iron Fist'' (vol. 3) #1–3 (July–September 1998), by writer [[Dan Jurgens]] and penciller [[Jackson Guice]]. Also around this time, he was among the ensemble of the group series ''[[Heroes for Hire]]'' which ran 19 issues (July 1997 – January 1999).

Following a four-issue miniseries by writer [[Jay Faerber]] and penciller [[Jamal Igle]], ''Iron Fist: Wolverine'' (November 2000 – February 2001), co-starring the [[X-Men]] character [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and cover-billed as ''Iron Fist/Wolverine: The Return of K'un-Lun'', came another solo miniseries, ''Iron Fist'' vol. 4 #1–6 (May–October 2004), by writer [[Jim Mullaney]] and penciller Kevin Lau. Subsequently, a new Iron Fist series premiered called ''[[The Immortal Iron Fist]]''. The series was written jointly by [[Ed Brubaker]] and [[Matt Fraction]] from issues #1–14 (January 2007 – June 2008) with artists [[Travel Foreman]] and [[David Aja]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=8624 |title=Iron Drawing Hand: Aja talks "The Immortal Iron Fist" |website=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=November 16, 2006 |access-date=February 21, 2007 }}</ref> Fraction wrote issues #15 and 16 alone. From issue #17 (September 2008) to the series' cancellation at issue #27 (August 2009), the series was written by [[Duane Swierczynski]] and largely drawn by a returning Travel Foreman.<ref>{{cite web |first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=15878 |title=New Fists Of Fury: Swierczynski Talks "Iron Fist" |website=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=April 7, 2008 |access-date=June 11, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Ekstrom |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=152812 |title=Talking Iron Fist With Swierczynski, Fraction, Brubaker and Foreman |work=[[Newsarama]] |date=April 7, 2008 |access-date=June 11, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102130005/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=152812 |archive-date=January 2, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Jesse |last=Schedeen |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/864/864868p1.html |title=Duane Swiercynski Helms The Immortal Iron Fist |website=[[IGN]] |date=April 7, 2008 |access-date=June 11, 2010 }}</ref>

Iron Fist's appearances outside his own title include three Iron Fist stories in Marvel's black-and-white comics magazine ''[[The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu]]'' #10 (March 1975), an additional story co-starring the [[Sons of the Tiger]] in issue #18 (November 1975), and a six-part serial, "The Living Weapon", in #19–24 (December 1975 – May 1976). He made guest appearances in such titles as ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'', ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', the Submariner series ''Namor'', ''[[Black Panther (Marvel Comics)|Black Panther]]'', and ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]''. Iron Fist appeared as a regular character throughout the 2010–2013 ''New Avengers'' series, from issue #1 (August 2010) through its final issue, #34 (January 2013). In 2014, Iron Fist was given new life and set to star in a new 12-issue comic book series written and drawn by [[Kaare Andrews]] titled ''Iron Fist: The Living Weapon'' as part of the ''[[Marvel NOW!#All-New Marvel NOW!|All-New Marvel NOW!]]'' event.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=50154|title = Kaare Andrews Trains for "Iron Fist: The Living Weapon"|date = 9 January 2014}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===Background===
Danny Rand was born in New York City. His father, [[Wendell Rand]], as a young boy happened upon the mystical city of [[K'un-L'un]]. During his time in K'un-L'un, Wendell saved the life of the city's ruler, Lord Tuan, and was adopted as Tuan's son. However, Wendell eventually left K'un-L'un and became a wealthy entrepreneur in the United States. He married socialite [[Heather Rand|Heather Duncan]] and had a child, Daniel. Wendell later organizes an expedition to again seek out K'un-L'un, taking his wife Heather, his business partner [[Harold Meachum]] and nine-year-old Danny. During the journey up the mountain, Danny slips off the path, his tie-rope taking his mother and father with him. Meachum, who also loves Heather, forces Wendell to plunge to his death but offers to rescue Heather and Danny. She rejects his help. Heather and Danny come across a makeshift bridge that appears out of nowhere and are attacked by a pack of wolves. Heather throws herself on the wolves to save Danny and is killed even as archers from K'un-L'un attempt to save her. The archers take the grieving Danny to see [[Yu-Ti]], the hooded ruler of K'un-L'un. When Danny expresses his desire for vengeance, Yü-Ti apprentices him to [[Lei Kung (comics)|Lei Kung]] the Thunderer, who teaches him martial arts. Danny proves to be the most gifted of Lei Kung's students. He toughens his fists by plunging them into buckets of sand, gravel, and rock. At 19, Danny is given the chance to attain the power of the Iron Fist by fighting and defeating the [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] [[Shou-Lao]] the Undying, who guards the molten heart that had been torn from its body. Guessing that the heart provides life energy to Shou-Lao through the dragon-shaped scar on its chest, Danny covers the scar with his own body and hangs on until Shou-Lao collapses and dies, in the process burning a dragon brand into his own chest. Having killed Shou-Lao, he enters its cave and plunges his fists into a brazier containing the creature's molten heart, emerging with the power of the Iron Fist. It is later revealed that Danny is part of a long lineage of Iron Fists. When K'un-L'un reappears on Earth after 10 years, Danny leaves to find his father's killer. Returning to New York, Danny Rand, dressed in the ceremonial garb of the Iron Fist, seeks out Harold Meachum, now head of Meachum Industries. After overcoming a number of attempts on his life, he confronts Meachum in his office, only to find the man legless&mdash;an amputation carried out when, after abandoning Danny and his mother, he was caught in heavy snow and his legs became frostbitten. Meachum accepts his fate and tells Iron Fist to kill him. Overcome with pity, Iron Fist walks away. At that moment Meachum is murdered by a mysterious ninja, and his daughter Joy blames Iron Fist for the death.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #15–18. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Eventually, Iron Fist clears his name and begins a career as a superhero, aided by his friends [[Colleen Wing]] and [[Misty Knight]].<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #21. Marvel Comics.</ref> Notable adversaries in his early career include [[Sabretooth (character)|Sabretooth]], the mysterious [[Master Khan]] (whom the ninja that killed Meachum once served), and the [[Steel Serpent]], the exiled son of Lei Kung who coveted the Iron Fist power.

===Heroes for Hire===
While working undercover, Misty Knight infiltrates the organization of crime lord [[Bushmaster (Marvel Comics)#John McIver|John Bushmaster]]. When Bushmaster discovers Knight's treachery, he kidnaps [[Claire Temple]] and Noah Burstein, close associates of [[Luke Cage]], better known as Power Man, and holds them hostage to force Cage to eliminate Knight. Iron Fist is on hand to stop him, however, and after a battle, the truth comes out. Rand helps Cage and the [[Daughters of the Dragon]] (Knight and Wing) battle Bushmaster, rescue Temple and Burstein, and obtain evidence that proves Cage's innocence of prior drug charges. Afterwards, Iron Fist and Power Man become partners, forming [[Heroes for Hire]], Inc.<ref>''Power Man'' #48–50. Marvel Comics.</ref> Iron Fist, in his [[secret identity]] of Danny Rand, resumes control of his parents' fortune as half of Rand-Meachum, Inc., making him quite wealthy.{{issue|date=March 2014}} This causes tension between Rand and Cage, who was raised poor. Power Man and Iron Fist's partnership ends when Rand is diagnosed with cancer and gets kidnapped as part of a plot masterminded by Master Khan. Just prior to a battle with the Black Dragon Chiantang (the brother of the mythical Dragon King), Danny is replaced by a [[doppelgänger]] created by the extra-dimensional [[H'ylthri]].<ref>behind the scenes in ''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #120.

Marvel Comics.</ref> In the ''Iron Fist'' miniseries, [[Miranda Rand]]-K'ai also returns from the dead. The H'ylthri revive her and promise to restore her to full life if she retrieves the extra-dimensional artifact known as the Zodiac Key. To this end, she takes the identity of Death Sting, bringing her into conflict with Iron Fist as well as with [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] When the H'ylthri try to kill Iron Fist, Miranda turns the power of the Zodiac Key against them, seemingly killing herself in the process. However, exposure to chemicals from the H'ylthri pods prevented her death.

{{Main|The Immortal Iron Fist}}
Orson Randall, Danny Rand's immediate predecessor, seeks out Danny Rand in New York and gives him The Book of the Iron Fist, a sacred ledger supposedly containing all the kung fu secrets of previous Iron Fists, which Randall claims will be necessary if Rand is to compete successfully in the coming tournament of the Seven Champions.{{issue|date=July 2014}} The [[Steel Serpent]], whose powers have been greatly augmented by the [[Crane Mother]], dispatches Randall.

Rand destroys the train intended to destroy [[K'un-L'un]] by extending his ''chi'' to find the train's electromagnetic field. Meanwhile, the revolution orchestrated by Lei Kung and Orson's daughter proves successful, with Nu-an, the Yu-Ti of K'un-Lun fleeing in terror. When Rand confronts Xao, Xao reveals that there is an eighth city of Heaven before killing himself. Rand suggests Lei Kung as the new Yu-Ti, with Orson's unnamed daughter as the new Thunderer.<ref>''The Immortal Iron Fist'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After learning that the Randall fortune that started Rand International was formed from the oppression of the Cities of Heaven, Rand decides to transform the company into a non-profit organization, dedicated to helping the poor. He also sets up the Thunder Dojo in Harlem to help inner-city children, buys back the old Heroes for Hire building as the new Rand International Headquarters and his new home, while offering Luke Cage a position at the company. He also tries to reconnect with Misty Knight. Rand, on his 33rd birthday, learns every single one of the previous Iron Fists died at the age of 33, except Orson Randall, who vanished at that time.<ref>''The Immortal Iron Fist'' #16. Marvel Comics.</ref> Soon afterward, Rand is attacked and defeated by Zhou Cheng, a servant of Ch'l-Lin, who claims to have killed the Iron Fists in order to enter K'un-Lun and devour the egg that births the next incarnation of Shou-Lao the Undying every generation, thus wiping out K'un-Lun's Iron Fist legacy. Luke, Misty, and Colleen arrive and save Rand. Rand has his shoulder dislocated during a second battle with Cheng, but manages to defeat Cheng even in his weakened state. Following the duel, the Immortal Weapons, Luke, Colleen, and Misty arrive, and reveal to Rand that they have discovered a map in Cheng's apartment that leads to the Eighth City of Heaven. Rand and the others realize that this is where Ch'l-Lin originated, and depart for the Eighth City.<ref>''The Immortal Iron Fist'' #20. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the Eighth City, he meets Quan Yaozu, the first Iron Fist, who became disillusioned with K'un-Lun and rose up to rule the Eighth City as Changming.

Marvel Comics.</ref> However, when Rand returns to New York, he finds a HYDRA cell waiting for him at Rand International, seeking retribution for the death of Xao, and holding Misty hostage. In the ensuing battle, Rand International is destroyed, but Rand and Misty escape unharmed. Now left with only a fraction of his former net worth, Rand and Misty purchase a new condo in Harlem, and Rand decides to focus all of his attention and remaining resources at the Thunder Dojo. While moving into their new home, Rand asks Misty to marry him. Initially skeptical of the offer, Misty accepts and reveals that she is pregnant with Rand's child.<ref>''The Immortal Iron Fist'' #27.

In ''Iron Fist: The Living Weapon'', Iron Fist is approached by a young monk named Pei, who tells him to return to K'un-Lun.

The dragons of the Heavenly Cities are being targeted by armies of undead ninjas and several villains, including [[Taskmaster (character)|Taskmaster]], [[Lady Bullseye]] and [[Midnight Sun (Marvel Comics)|Midnight Sun]] for their hearts, resulting in the deaths of many dragons and Tiger's Beautiful Daughter, prompting Iron Fist to team up with Luke, Pei, Gork, Fooh and the remaining Immortal Weapons to save the other dragons.  At the urging of the Xian goddess of Mercy [[Guanyin|Quan Yin]], Iron Fist and the others use Fooh's portal technology to manifest the Heavenly Cities on Earth so that other heroes, including [[Okoye (character)|Okoye]] and [[Sunspot (Marvel Comics)|Sunspot]], can join in the defense against the hordes of zombies and villains. When the zombies prove too much for them, Iron Fist and the group retreat to the Heart of Heaven, where they come across Okoye slaying the dragon of the Heart of Heaven, who takes advantage of their shock to slay the newly rescued dragon of the Kingdom of Spiders as well; Okoye explains that she was told to kill them by Quan Yin and the Heart of Heaven's dragon in order to secure the cosmic balance, thus gaining the power of both dragons.

==Powers and abilities==
Plunging his fists into the molten heart of the dragon Shou-Lao the Undying infused the dragon's superhuman energy into Rand. This, along with being trained by Lei Kung the Thunderer, gave Rand the power of the Iron Fist, allowing him to summon and focus his ''[[Qi|chi]]'' energy (also called natural energy or life force energy) to enhance his natural abilities to extraordinary levels. His strength, speed, stamina, durability, agility, reflexes and senses can all be greatly intensified, almost comparable to superhuman levels.

He is able to concentrate his own ''chi'' and the superhuman energy from Shou-Lao's heart into his hand, with it manifesting as a supernatural glow around his hand and fist. So concentrated, this "iron fist" can strike with superhuman hardness and impact, while his hand becomes impervious to pain and injury. Some of Rand's feats with the "iron fist" is knocking out Luke Cage,{{issue|date=May 2020}} knocking out a drunken Hercules,{{issue|date=May 2020}} taking down Black Panther (wearing his vibranium suit),{{issue|date=May 2020}} and taking down the S.H.I.E L.D Helicarrier with a single punch.{{issue|date=May 2020}} However, summoning the power required by this feat leaves Rand physically and mentally drained, unable to repeat the act for a time, as long as an entire day in certain instances, though after years of using the ability, it has become less draining.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} He can focus his ''chi'' inward to heal himself or outward to heal others of injury, as well as to give himself [[psychic]] senses and to [[telepathically]] fuse his consciousness with another person when looking directly into the pupil of his eye.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #37. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Rand is also a skilled acrobat, gymnast, and a master of all of K'un-Lun's martial arts, as well as various fighting styles from Earth, including [[Shaolin Kung Fu]], [[Aikido]],<ref>''Iron Fist'' #15 (September 1977).

==Other characters named Iron Fist==
This section lists the other people who have been called Iron Fist:

===Fan Fei===
In 1,000,000 BC, a K'un-Lun native named Fan Fei was born to the Green Lotus House and had taken a fascination with the [[Caveman|cavemen]] that lived outside K'un-Lun;<ref>{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix8/ironfistfanfei.htm|Iron Fist (Fan Fei)}}</ref> going so far as to train a few of them in secret. After she was exposed, Fan Fei was chained up and forced to watch as her students were fed to Shou-Lou by Lei Kung. When she broke out, in the hopes that she will die fighting Shou-Lou, Fan Fei punched the dragon in his chest tattoo and gained his powers. Lei Kung had Fan Fei exiled from K'un-Lun, believing Shou-Lou was dead, and she traveled the world; fighting Deviants and the Gorgilla Clan of Man-Apes along the way. Fan Fei was approached by [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], who wanted her to use her powers to conquer Earth, but she declined. In response, Mephisto granted his gifts to the Gorgilla Clan. After a fight with Fan Fei, Mephisto led the Gorgilla Clan's Ape King to the Power Infinity Gem, which he used to fight Fan Fei again. After recuperating, Fan Fei found herself at the entrance of K'un-Lun. Lei Kung states that her sentencing was wrong, as they learned Shou-Lou was immortal, and wanted to bring her home. However, she declined, stating that Earth was her home and her fights here are just the beginning.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 8 #13</ref> Fan Fei later banded together with [[Agamotto]], [[Phoenix Force (comics)#Lady Phoenix|Lady Phoenix]], [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]], and Stone Age versions of [[Black Panther (character)#Black Panther 1,000,000 B.C.|Black Panther]], [[Ghost Rider#Ghost / The Rider|Ghost Rider]], and [[Star Brand#Vnn|Star Brand]] to fought off a Celestial named the Fallen.

Marvel Comics.</ref> Centuries later, when Danny and the Immortal weapons arrive in the Eighth City at the behest of Lei Kung to free the wrongfully convicted prisoners, Quan has them captured and forces them to fight to the death in numerous matches.  When Danny finds out about Quan's history, he is able to prove his altruistic intentions, which convinces Quan that K'un-Lun is no longer the corrupt city as it once was and agrees to meet Lei Kung.<ref>''Immortal Iron Fist'' #26. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Li Park===
In 730 A.D., a pacifist named Li Park became the new Iron Fist, who sought to resolve conflict by avoiding direct conflict. As a local village battled with a Chinese general intent on conquering K'un-Lun, which had been struck by a plague, Li utilized his newly discovered hypnotic fist technique to dissuade the soldiers. When his technique failed to save the villagers, Li put aside his pacifism and used more aggressive actions. Ultimately, Li was able to rescue the remaining villagers and led them to K’un-Lun, where they helped repopulate the city.<ref>''Immortal Iron Fist'' #24. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The story of Iron Fist has been criticized for [[cultural appropriation]], [[orientalism]] and reinforcing a [[white savior]] narrative, with Rob Bricken of ''[[io9]]'' summarizing Danny Rand as a clichéd "white guy [who] discovers a foreign culture, learns its ways, and becomes better at it than the people born into it".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2016/03/it-actually-really-really-sucks-that-tvs-iron-fist-is-white/|title=It Actually Really, Really Sucks That TV's Iron Fist Is White|last=Bricken|first=Rob|website=[[io9]]|date=March 7, 2016|access-date=July 2, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180702175646/https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2016/03/it-actually-really-really-sucks-that-tvs-iron-fist-is-white/|archive-date=July 2, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/47414-iron-fist-being-white-was-always-racist-netflix|title='Iron Fist' Was Always Racist — and the Netflix Show Isn't Helping|last=Lee|first=Jonathan|website=[[Inverse (website)|Inverse]]|date=July 25, 2018|access-date=December 5, 2018|archive-url=https://archive.today/20181205035656/https://www.inverse.com/article/47414-iron-fist-being-white-was-always-racist-netflix|archive-date=December 5, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-iron-fist-white-savior-controversy-creator-and-stars-discuss-the-mounting-backlash|title=The 'Iron Fist' White Savior Controversy: Creator and Stars Discuss the Mounting Backlash|last=Leon|first=Melissa|website=[[Daily Beast]]|date=March 15, 2017|archive-url=https://archive.today/20211031200048/https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-iron-fist-white-savior-controversy-creator-and-stars-discuss-the-mounting-backlash|archive-date=October 31, 2021|url-status=live}}</ref>  Upon the announcement of [[Iron Fist (TV series)|the television series]], an online movement was started to change Iron Fist as an [[Asian Americans|Asian American]] character to subvert offensive tropes while providing some depth to the character.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thenerdsofcolor.org/2014/03/11/marvel-please-cast-an-asian-american-iron-fist/|title=Marvel, Please Cast an Asian American Iron Fist|last=Chow|first=Keith|website=The Nerds of Color|date=March 11, 2014|access-date=July 2, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180702150839/https://thenerdsofcolor.org/2014/03/11/marvel-please-cast-an-asian-american-iron-fist/|archive-date=July 2, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>  Supporters of the movement included comic writer [[Gail Simone]], who acknowledged she was a fan of Iron Fist but agreed that the character should be changed to Asian American.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thenerdsofcolor.org/2015/12/10/fear-of-an-asian-martial-artist-the-thing-about-stereotypes-aaironfist/|title=Fear of an Asian Martial Artist: The Thing about Stereotypes & #AAIronFist|last=Chow|first=Keith|website=The Nerds of Color|date=December 10, 2015|access-date=July 2, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180702150846/https://thenerdsofcolor.org/2015/12/10/fear-of-an-asian-martial-artist-the-thing-about-stereotypes-aaironfist/|archive-date=July 2, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>  The role ultimately went to English actor [[Finn Jones]], whose performance was panned by critics along with the show's depiction of Asian culture during its [[Iron Fist (season 1)|first season]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/3/15/14919546/iron-first-marvel-reviews-finn-jones|title=Iron Fist isn't bad because critics don't get it.

[[Roy Thomas]], co-creator of Iron Fist, defended the character in response to criticism, arguing that Iron Fist was created for a less "[[Political correctness|PC]]" time.  While Thomas added that he would not be bothered if Iron Fist had been changed to Asian-American, he was not "ashamed" for making Rand white.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/29155-iron-fist-marvel-comics-whitewashing-roy-thomas|title='Iron Fist' Creator: Whitewashing Controversy "Righteous Indignation"|last=Busch|first=Caitlin|work=[[Inverse (website)|Inverse]]|date=March 17, 2017|access-date=March 25, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327075714/https://www.inverse.com/article/29155-iron-fist-marvel-comics-whitewashing-roy-thomas|archive-date=March 27, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Comic book creator]] [[Rob Liefeld]] also defended the character, denying that Rand's story was racist and argued that changing his race to Asian was "[[Whitewashing in film|reverse whitewashing]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailydot.com/parsec/rob-liefeld-white-iron-fist-casting/|title=Rob Liefeld says casting an Asian American Iron Fist would be 'reverse white-washing'|last=Baker-Whitelaw|first=Gavia|work=[[The Daily Dot]]|date=October 12, 2016|access-date=April 10, 2022|archive-url=https://archive.today/20161017070404/http://www.dailydot.com/parsec/rob-liefeld-white-iron-fist-casting/|archive-date=October 17, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>  Other commentators have echoed similar sentiments; while acknowledging that Rand's origins were problematic, some felt that changing him to Asian would reinforce the stereotype of Asians being proficient in martial arts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/blog/2013/11/09/iron-fist-tv-series-five-things-we-want-to-see/|title=Iron Fist TV Series: Five Things We Want to See|last=Burlingame|first=Russ|website=ComicBook.com|date=November 9, 2013|access-date=April 10, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180702204330/http://comicbook.com/blog/2013/11/09/iron-fist-tv-series-five-things-we-want-to-see/|archive-date=July 2, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/opinion-i-dont-want-an-asian-american-iron-fist/|title=OPINION: I Don't Want an Asian-American Iron Fist|last=Ching|first=Albert|website=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=December 9, 2015|access-date=July 2, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220410191159/https://www.cbr.com/opinion-i-dont-want-an-asian-american-iron-fist/|archive-date=April 10, 2022|url-status=live}}</ref>

In an apparent response to the racial backlash against the character and the negative reception of the television series, Marvel announced in 2021 that Danny Rand will leave the mantle and a new younger Iron Fist of Asian descent will be introduced in a new comic series helmed by an Asian creative team.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/new-iron-fist-marvel/ |title=This is the new Marvel Iron Fist - but is he new or someone we already know? |website=[[GamesRadar+]] |date=October 29, 2021 |access-date=November 5, 2021 }}</ref> [[Alyssa Wong]], writer of the new series, explained that it was "impossible to be unaware of the controversy", which she took into consideration when writing the series.  While noting that there had been Iron Fists of Asian descent before, Wong pointed out that all of them were supporting characters in Rand's story or long dead, arguing that the new Iron Fist was an important step forward for the title and the ongoing push for diversity.  Wong also acknowledged Rand's sizeable fanbase despite criticisms, reassuring that he would play an important role for the new Iron Fist and that the new series would not "erase" Rand's history and legacy but instead build upon it.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.ign.com/articles/iron-fist-asian-hero-interview-relaunch-marvel |title=Why Marvel Is Introducing an Asian Iron Fist After 50 Years |last=Schedeen|first=Jesse |website=[[IGN]] |date=November 11, 2021 |access-date=April 10, 2022 }}</ref>  The new series, which revealed the Chinese superhero [[Lin Lie|Sword Master]] as the new Iron Fist, has since received critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.comicsbookcase.com/reviews-archive/iron-fist-1 |title=REVIEW: IRON FIST #1 delivers a strong opener for the character's new era |last=Gault|first=Rebecca |website=Comics Bookcase |date=February 16, 2022 |access-date=April 10, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.cbr.com/marvels-iron-fist-1-comic-review/ |title=Marvel's Iron Fist #1 Comic Review |website=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=February 21, 2022|access-date=April 10, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://gizmodo.com/marvel-iron-fist-comic-miniseries-lin-lie-1848738992 | title=Marvel's New Iron Fist is One of Their Best Updates in Years |website=[[io9]]|date=April 3, 2022|access-date=April 10, 2022}}</ref>

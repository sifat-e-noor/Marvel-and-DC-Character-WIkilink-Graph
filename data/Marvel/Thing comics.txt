'''The Thing''' is a [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is a founding member of the [[Fantastic Four]]. The Thing was created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], and he first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|The Fantastic Four]]'' #1 ([[cover-date]]d Nov. 1961).

Known for his trademark rocky appearance, he has superhuman strength, a sense of humor, and the battle cry "It's clobberin' time!" Thing's speech patterns are loosely based on those of [[Jimmy Durante]].<ref>''Stan's Soapbox, Bullpen Bulletins, September 1997''</ref> [[Michael Bailey Smith]] played Ben Grimm in his human form, while [[Carl Ciarfalio]] played the Thing in ''[[The Fantastic Four (unreleased film)|The Fantastic Four]]'' film from 1994, [[Michael Chiklis]] portrayed the Thing in the [[2005 in film|2005]] film ''[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]'' and its [[2007 in film|2007]] sequel ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]''. [[Jamie Bell]] acted the part in ''[[Fantastic Four (2015 film)|Fantastic Four]]'' (2015).

In 2011, [[IGN]] ranked the Thing 18th in the "Top 100 Comic Book Heroes",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/18|title=The Thing - #18 Top Comic Book Heroes - IGN|website=[[IGN]]|date=2011|access-date=July 21, 2015}}</ref> and 23rd in their list of "The Top 50 Avengers" in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |date=April 30, 2012 |title=The Top 50 Avengers |url=https://www.ign.com/top/avengers/23 |website=IGN |access-date=July 28, 2015}}</ref> The Thing was named ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine's tenth of "The 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters" in 2008.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.empireonline.com/50greatestcomiccharacters/default.asp?c=10|title= The 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters|magazine=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|access-date=September 12, 2016}}</ref>

==Publication history==
{{Main|Fantastic Four#Publication history}}
Created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|The Fantastic Four]]'' #1 (Nov. 1961). Kirby modeled the character after himself.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Batchelor |first1=Bob |title=Stan Lee: The Man Behind Marvel |date=2017 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=9781442277816 |page=74}}</ref>

In addition to appearing in the Fantastic Four, the Thing has been the star of ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'', ''[[Strange Tales]]'' (with his fellow Fantastic Four member the [[Human Torch]]), and two incarnations of his own eponymous series, as well as numerous [[miniseries]] and [[One-shot (comics)|one-shots]].

===''Strange Tales''===
The Thing joined his Fantastic Four partner and frequent rival the [[Human Torch]] in #124 (1964) of ''[[Strange Tales#Monsters and magician|Strange Tales]]'', which previously featured solo adventures of the Human Torch and backup [[Doctor Strange]] stories. The change was intended to liven the comic through the always humorous chemistry between the Torch and the Thing. They were replaced in #135 (1965) with the "modern-day" version of [[Nick Fury]], Agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], who had already been appearing in ''[[Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos]]''.

===''Marvel Two-in-One'' (1974–1983)===
After a 1973 try-out in two issues of ''[[Marvel Feature]]'', the Thing starred in the long-running series ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cassell|first=Dewey|title=Marvel Feature|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=#71|pages=14–18|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=April 2014|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> In each issue, Ben Grimm would team up with another character from the [[Marvel Universe]], often an obscure or colorful character. The series helped to introduce characters from Marvel's lineup, by way of teaming up with the more recognizable Thing. In 1992, Marvel reprinted four ''Two-in-One stories'' (#50, 51, 77 and 80) as a miniseries under the title ''The Adventures of the Thing''. The series was cancelled after 100 issues and seven [[Annual publication#Comic books|''Annual''s]] to make way for a solo series.

===''The Thing'' (1983–1986)===
The cancellation of ''Marvel Two-in-One'' led to the Thing's first completely solo series, which ran for 36 issues. It was originally written by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and later, [[Mike Carlin]]. The series also featured art by [[Ron Wilson (comics)|Ron Wilson]] and later by [[Paul Neary]]. It elaborated on Ben Grimm's poor childhood on [[Yancy Street Gang|Yancy Street]] in its early issues, and chronicled the Thing's later foray into the world of [[professional wrestling]]. It also featured a major storyline offshoot from Marvel's ''[[Secret Wars]]'' event, in which the Thing elects to remain on the [[Beyonder]]'s Battleworld after discovering that the planet enables him to return to human form at will. A full third of the series' stories take place on Battleworld.

===2002–present===
In 2002, Marvel released ''The Thing: Freakshow'', a four-issue miniseries written by [[Geoff Johns]] and illustrated by [[Scott Kolins]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Thing|url=https://www.goodreads.com/work/best_book/155244-the-thing-freakshow-tpb|access-date=2021-01-26|website=www.goodreads.com}}</ref> in which the Thing travels across the United States by train, inadvertently stumbling upon a deformed gypsy boy he once ridiculed as a teenager, who is now the super-strong main attraction of a troupe of traveling [[Freak show|circus freaks]]. He later discovers a town full of alien [[Kree]] and [[Skrull]] warriors fighting over a [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] infant.

In 2003, Marvel released a four-issue miniseries written by [[Evan Dorkin]] and illustrated by [[Dean Haspiel]], ''The Thing: Night Falls on Yancy Street''{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}. The story was more character-driven than the stories that usually feature the Thing. [[Tom Spurgeon]] found its outlook on relationships "depressing".<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Spurgeon, Tom]]|title=CR Reviews: Startling Stories: The Thing: Night Falls on Yancy Street #1-4 | url=http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/briefings/cr_reviews/3815/ |publisher=[[The Comics Reporter]]|date=January 19, 2006}}</ref>

After the success of the 2005 [[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|''Fantastic Four'' feature film]] and events in the comics series that resulted in Grimm becoming a millionaire, the Thing was once again given his own series in 2005, ''The Thing'', written by [[Dan Slott]] and penciled by [[Andrea Di Vito]] and [[Kieron Dwyer]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} It was canceled with issue #8 in 2006.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The Thing was a member of [[The New Avengers (comics)|The New Avengers]], when that team debuted in their self-titled second series in 2010.<ref>[http://marvel.com/news/all.11447.i_am_a_new_avenger "I Am A New Avenger"], Marvel Comics, 1 March 2010.</ref> He appeared as a regular character throughout the 2010–2013 ''New Avengers'' series, from issue #1 (Aug. 2010) through its final issue #34 (Jan. 2013).

==Fictional character biography==
===Background===
Born on Yancy Street in [[New York City]]'s [[Lower East Side]], to a [[Jew]]ish<ref name="Jewish">{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/lit/comics/Thing.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060310021122/http://www.adherents.com/lit/comics/Thing.html |url-status=usurped |archive-date=March 10, 2006 |title=The religion of The Thing (Ben Grimm) of the Fantastic Four |publisher=Adherents.com |access-date=2011-04-12}}</ref> family, '''Benjamin Jacob "Ben" Grimm''' has an early life of poverty and hardship, shaping him into a tough, streetwise scrapper. His older brother [[Daniel Grimm Jr.|Daniel]], whom Ben idolizes, is killed in a street gang fight when Ben is eight years old. This portion of his own life is modeled on that of [[Jack Kirby]], who grew up on tough [[Delancey Street]], whose brother died when he was young, whose father was named Benjamin, and who was named Jacob at birth.<ref>{{cite book|author=Packer, Sharon|title=Superheroes and Superegos: Analyzing the Minds Behind the Masks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1UopTvWYaYgC&pg=PA168|access-date=August 12, 2013|date=December 14, 2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-35537-0|page=168}}</ref> Following the death of his parents, Ben is raised by his Uncle Jake (who married a much younger wife, Petunia, who becomes a frequent reference used by the character until her death<ref>"Doom's Master, Part Three".

Marvel Comics.</ref> Despite their being from radically different backgrounds, science student Richards describes to Grimm his dream of building a space rocket to explore the regions of space around Mars; Grimm jokingly agrees to fly that rocket when the day comes.

The details of his life story have been modified over the decades. Prior to the stories published in the 1970s, Grimm, after earning multiple advanced degrees in engineering,{{issue|date=July 2017}} serves in the [[United States Marine Corps]] as a [[test pilot]] during [[World War II]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #367.

====Religion====
In keeping with an early taboo in the comic superhero world against revealing a character's religion,{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} the fact that Grimm is Jewish was not explicitly revealed until four decades after his creation, in the story "Remembrance of Things Past" in ''Fantastic Four'' vol. 3, #56 (Aug. 2002). In this story, Grimm returns to his old neighborhood to find Mr. Sheckerberg, a pawn shop owner he knew as a child. Flashbacks during this story reveal Grimm's Jewish heritage. He recites the [[Shema]], an important Jewish prayer often recited, over the dying Sheckerberg, who eventually recovers.<ref name="Jewish"/> In a later story, Grimm agrees to celebrate his [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah]], since it has been 13 years, the age a Jewish boy celebrates his Bar Mitzvah, since he began his "second life" as the Thing. To celebrate the ceremony, Grimm organizes a [[poker]] tournament for every available superhero in the [[Marvel Universe]].<ref>[[Slott, Dan]] (w), [[Kieron Dwyer|Dwyer, Kieron]] (a). "Last Hand", ''The Thing'' vol. 2, #8 (Marvel Comics, Sept. 2006).</ref>

In the 2004 ''Fantastic Four'' story "Hereafter Part 1: A Glimpse of God", the Thing is killed by an energy weapon wielded by Reed Richards, but is brought back to life in one story by the hand of God.<ref name="Jewish"/><ref>"Hereafter Part 1: A Glimpse of God", ''Fantastic Four'' #511 (May 2004).

===The Thing===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:FF51.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The cover for ''Fantastic Four'' #51 (June 1966). Art by Jack Kirby.]] -->
Some years later, Reed Richards, now a successful scientist, once again makes contact with Grimm. Richards has built his spaceship, and reminds Grimm of his promise to fly it. After the government denies him permission to fly the spaceship himself, Richards plots a clandestine flight piloted by Grimm and accompanied by his future wife [[Invisible Woman|Susan Storm]], who had helped provide funding for the rocket, and her younger brother [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]], who helped the group gain access to the launch system. Although reluctant to fly the rocket, Ben is persuaded to do so by Sue, for whom he has a soft spot. During this unauthorized ride into the upper atmosphere of Earth and the [[Van Allen radiation belt|Van Allen Belts]], they are pelted by a [[cosmic ray]] storm and exposed to radiation against which the ship's shields are no protection. Upon crashing down to Earth, each of the four learn that they have developed fantastic superhuman abilities. Grimm's skin is transformed into a thick, lumpy orange hide, which gradually evolves into his now-familiar craggy covering of large rocky plates. Richards proposes the quartet band together to use their new abilities for the betterment of humanity, and Grimm, in a moment of self-pity, adopts the super-heroic sobriquet, ''the Thing''. The team clashes with the [[Mole Man]] in their first appearance.<ref name=FFV1#1/>

Trapped in his monstrous form, Grimm is an unhappy yet reliable member of the team. He trusts in his friend Reed Richards to one day develop a cure for his condition. However, when he encounters blind sculptress [[Alicia Masters]],<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref> Grimm develops an unconscious resistance to being transformed back to his human form. Subconsciously fearing that Masters prefers him to remain in the monstrous form of the Thing, Grimm's body rejects various attempts by Richards to restore his human form, lest he lose Masters' love. Grimm has remained a stalwart member of the Fantastic Four for years. The Thing first fought the [[Hulk]] early in his career,<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref> with many such further clashes over the years. Not long after that, he is first reverted to his human form, but is then restored to his Thing form to battle [[Doctor Doom]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #38-40. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Grimm has been temporarily replaced on the team twice. First, after Grimm temporarily lost his powers and reverted to human form,<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #167 (Feb. 1976). Marvel Comics.</ref> Reed Richards hired [[Luke Cage]] (then using the code name "Power Man") to take his place until Richards had completed a Thing-suit for Ben (however, Ben unexpectedly reverted into the actual Thing again later on).<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #168 (March 1976). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Years later, after Grimm chose to remain on [[Battleworld]] in the aftermath of the "[[Secret Wars]]" due to his apparent control over his transformation between his human and mutated states, he asked the [[She-Hulk]] to fill in for him. Mister Fantastic did leave him with the device needed to return to Earth when it comes time.<ref>''[[Secret Wars]]'' #12 (April 1985). Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Fantastic Four'' #265 (April 1984).

Once he left, the planet had no more reason to exist and so it broke apart.<ref>''The Thing'' #22</ref>

On returning to Earth, he learns that Alicia had become romantically involved with his teammate Johnny Storm during his absence<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #277 (April 1985). Marvel Comics.</ref> (it is eventually revealed that this Alicia was actually the [[Skrull]] impostor [[Lyja]]).<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #357.

Marvel Comics.</ref> Eventually, he returns to his surrogate family as leader of the Fantastic Four when Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Woman leave the team to raise their son Franklin, at which point Ben invites [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]] and [[Sharon Ventura|Ms. Marvel II (Sharon Ventura)]] to fill their slots.<ref name=ff307>''Fantastic Four'' #307.

After being further mutated into the more monstrous rocky form, Ben is briefly changed back to his human form, and returned leadership of the Fantastic Four to Reed Richards.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #326-327. Marvel Comics.</ref> Grimm once more returned to his traditional orange rocky form out of love for Ms. Marvel.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #350. Marvel Comics.</ref> He remains a steadfast member of the Fantastic Four.

===In the 21st century===
In a ''Fantastic Four'' comic published in 2005, Ben learns that he is entitled to a large sum of money, his share of the Fantastic Four fortune, which Reed Richards had never touched, as he had the shares of the other teammates (who were family members) in order to pay off various debts of the group.

The Thing uses his newfound wealth to build a community center in his old neighborhood on Yancy Street, the "Grimm Youth Center". Thinking the center is named after the Thing himself, the [[Yancy Street Gang]] plans to graffiti the building exterior, but discovers the building was actually named after Daniel Grimm, Ben's deceased older brother and former leader of the gang. The relationship between the Yancy Streeters and the Thing is then effectively reconciled, or at least changed to a more good-natured, playful rivalry (as exemplified by the comic ending, with the Yancy Streeters spray-painting the sleeping Thing).

Some personality traits of the cantankerously lovable, occasionally cigar-smoking, [[Jew]]ish native of the Lower East Side are popularly recognized as having been inspired by those of co-creator Jack Kirby, who in interviews has said he intended Grimm to be an alter ego of himself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/story/113/story_11303_1.html |title=Comic Faith: The Thing's Religion Revealed |publisher=Beliefnet.com |first= Jeffrey |last= Weiss |at= reprinted; originally: "Comic-book heroes seldom reveal their faith: Recent revelation of the Thing's religion was a rare moment for pop culture", ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'', August 24, 2002|access-date=2011-04-12}}</ref>

===Civil War/The Initiative===
Initially in the 2006 storyline "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]", Ben is a reluctant member of the pro-registration side of the controversy over the [[2006 Superhuman Registration Act]] (SHRA), until he witnesses a battle on Yancy Street in which [[Captain America]]'s forces try to rescue captured allies held by [[Iron Man]]'s forces. The Fantastic Four's foes the [[Mad Thinker]] and the [[Puppet Master (Marvel Comics)|Puppet Master]] try to escalate the battle, using a mind-controlled Yancy Streeter to deliver a bomb. The young man dies and the Thing verbally blasts both sides for not caring about the civilians caught in the conflict. He announces that, while he thinks the registration is wrong, he is also not going to fight the government and is thus leaving the country for France. While in France, he meets ''Les Héros de Paris'' (The Heroes of Paris).<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #539. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Ben returns to New York as both sides of the SHRA battle in the city. Indifferent to choosing sides, Ben focuses on protecting civilians from harm.<ref>[[Millar, Mark]] (w), [[McNiven, Steve]] (p), [[Vines, Dexter]] (i). "Civil War, Part Seven of Seven", ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In ''Fantastic Four'' #543 (March 2007), Ben celebrates the Fantastic Four's 11th anniversary along with the Human Torch, and latecomers Reed and Sue. The aftermath of the Civil War is still being felt in this issue, as Ben and Johnny (and even [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin]]) consider the future of the team and Reed and Sue's marriage. When Reed and Sue arrive near issue's end, they announce that they are taking a break from the team and have found two replacement members: the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] of the [[X-Men]]. The title of the story in this issue is a quote from Ben, "Come on, Suzie, don't leave us hangin'."<ref>[[McDuffie, Dwayne]]. "C'Mon, Suzie, Don't Leave Us Hangin'", ''Fantastic Four'' #543. Marvel Comics, March 2007.</ref>

Ben Grimm served as one of the pallbearers at the memorial service for Captain America, along with Tony Stark, Ms. Marvel, Rick Jones, T'Challa and Sam Wilson.<ref>''Fallen Son (Iron Man)'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Ben has been identified as Number 53 of the 142 registered superheroes who appear on the cover of the comic book ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 |title=Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map |publisher=Marvel.com |access-date=2011-04-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120526061017/http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 |archive-date=2012-05-26 }}</ref>

==="World War Hulk"===
Ben once again tries to take on the Hulk within the events of the 2007 storyline "[[World War Hulk]]" in order to buy Reed Richards the time he needs to complete his plans for the Hulk. Ben gives his best shots, but the Hulk takes his punches without slowing down. The Hulk proceeds to knock out Ben by punching both sides of his head simultaneously.<ref>[[Pak, Greg]] (w), [[Romita, John Jr.]] (p), [[Janson, Klaus]] (i). "Chapter 2", ''[[World War Hulk]]'' #2.

Released from his imprisonment, Ben, [[Spider-Man]], and [[Luke Cage]] attack the [[Warbound]], with Ben fighting [[Korg (comics)|Korg]]. Their battle is brought to an abrupt end when Hiroim repairs the damage to [[Manhattan]] Island, drawing the energy to do so from Ben and Korg.<ref>''World War Hulk: Aftersmash''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Secret Invasion===
In the ''[[Secret Invasion]]: Fantastic Four'' miniseries, the Skrull Lyja, posing as Sue, sends the [[Baxter Building]], with Ben, Johnny, Franklin, and [[Valeria Richards|Valeria]] inside, into the [[Negative Zone]]. Not long after their arrival, Ben has to protect Franklin and Valeria from an impending onslaught of giant insects.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four'' #1.

===Heroic Age===
Following the [[Siege (comics)|Siege]] of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], [[Luke Cage]] asks Ben to serve on his [[The New Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] team. Although Ben states that his loyalty will always be to the Fantastic Four, Cage confirms that he is not asking Ben to resign from his original team, merely suggesting that Ben split his time between the two teams, as [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] divides his time between the [[X-Men]] and the Avengers.<ref>''Heroic Age: New Avengers'' #1.

Although the Baxter Building is now owned by a new superhero team, Fantastix, the Thing allows his teammates to use his hometown in Yancy Street as their current operation base.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 6 #2-4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Relationships==
The Thing is generally well liked by other heroes within the [[Marvel Universe]]. Grimm's relationship with his teammates has been a close but occasionally edgy one given his temper. He and Johnny Storm (the Human Torch) often argue and clash but they do respect each other.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Grimm's first love interest is the blind Alicia Masters, and he is intensely protective of her. When Johnny starts a relationship of his own with Alicia and they become engaged, Grimm is upset. However, he has to concede that, unlike himself and his stone-covered body, Johnny can "be a man".<ref>''Fantastic Four vs. the X-Men'' (Feb. 1987-June 1987).

Grimm is best friends with [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], whom he addresses with the nickname "Stretch", due to Richards' natural height and his ability to stretch his body. However, Grimm also holds Reed responsible for his condition, since Richards had dismissed the potential danger of the cosmic rays that gave them their powers, although Grimm had taken them very seriously.<ref name=FFV1#1/> At times of real frustration towards Reed, Grimm refers to him simply as "Richards".<ref>''Fantastic Four''  #141 (Dec. 1973). Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Fantastic Four'' #301 (April 1987). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Grimm is the [[Godparent|godfather]] of Reed and [[Invisible Woman|Sue]]'s son [[Franklin Richards (character)|Franklin]], who affectionately calls him "Unca Ben".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Waid|first=Mark|title=Fantastic Four #62|publisher=Marvel|year=2003}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
{{More citations needed section|date=October 2006}}

The Thing's primary superhuman power is his great physical strength.<ref>{{Cite comic | writer = Stan Lee | artist = Jack Kirby | story = A Skrull Walks Among Us! | title = The Fantastic Four | issue = #18 | date = Sept. 1963 | publisher = Marvel Comics | page = 5}}</ref> Over the years, as a result of further mutation and rigorous training on machines designed by Reed Richards, his strength has increased dramatically.{{issue|date=September 2019}}

He is capable of surviving impacts of great force without sustaining injury, as his body is covered with an orange, flexible, rock-like hide. He is also able to withstand gunfire from high-caliber weapons as well as armor-piercing rounds. It is possible to breach his exterior, however, and he does bleed as a result. One such instance involved [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]'s [[adamantium]] claws scarring The Thing's face.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #374 (March 1993)</ref>

The Thing's highly advanced musculature generates fewer fatigue toxins during physical activity, granting him superhuman levels of stamina. When in his Thing form, he has only four fingers on each hand and four toes on each foot. The loss of one digit of each hand and foot, aside from the increase in volume of the remainder, does not affect his manual dexterity. However, he has been shown doing things like holding a pencil and using it to dial a phone (even with [[rotary dial]]s), or to push buttons on a keypad, to use devices that would ordinarily be too small for him.{{issue|date=July 2017}}

Aside from his physical attributes, the Thing's senses can withstand higher levels of sensory stimulation than an ordinary human, with the exception of his sense of touch. His lungs are possessed of greater efficiency and volume than those of an ordinary human. As a result, the Thing is capable of holding his breath for much longer periods of time.{{issue|date=July 2017}}

The Thing is an exceptionally skilled [[Aviator|pilot]], due to his time spent as a test pilot in the [[United States Marine Corps]] and as a founding member of the Fantastic Four. He is also a formidable and relentless hand-to-hand combatant. His fighting style incorporates elements of [[boxing]],<ref name=":0">''Fantastic Four'' #19 (Oct. 1963)</ref> [[wrestling]], [[judo]],<ref name=":0" /> [[jujitsu]], and [[Street fighting|street-fighting]] techniques, as well as [[hand-to-hand combat]] training from the military.{{issue|date=July 2017}}

On occasion, when Ben Grimm regained his human form and lost his Thing powers, he used a suit of powered battle armor designed by Reed Richards that simulated the strength and durability of his mutated body, albeit to a weaker degree. Wearing the suit, which was designed to physically resemble his rocky form, Ben continued to participate in the Fantastic Four's adventures. The first exo-skeletal Thing suit was destroyed after [[Galactus]] restored Ben's natural powers and form. A second suit was built (presumably by Richards) and used sporadically when Ben had been returned to his human form again.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #170–175 (May–Oct. 1976). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Reed has failed many times to restore Ben permanently to human form. When Doom reverses Sharon Ventura's similar cosmic-ray transformation, he uses both science and magic.<ref name="ffv1no350">{{Cite comic |Writer=[[Walt Simonson|Simonson, Walt]] |Penciller=Simonson, Walt |Inker=[[Allen Milgrom|Milgrom, Allen]] |Colorist=Vancata, Brad |Letterer=[[Bill Oakley (comics)|Oakley, Bill]] |Editor=[[Ralph Macchio (editor)|Macchio, Ralph]] |Story=The More Things Change...! |url=https://www.marvel.com/comics/issue/13173/fantastic_four_1961_350 |Title=Fantastic Four |Volume=1 |Issue=350 |Date=1991-03 |Publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> Ben is almost immortal when in his Thing form, as he only ages when he is human.

Following Black Skull's defeat, Ant-Man joins Robbie Reyes and his Deathlok companion in their quest to liberate the enslaved Earths from the Multiversal Masters of Evil as he leaves Infinity Thing and Wonder Man to rebuild Earth-818.<ref>''Avengers: Forever'' Vol. 2 #1-4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

He appears alongside the F5 whenever they appear in the ''Spider-Girl'' series and related mini-series.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===New Amsterdam===
In ''Marvel Two-in-One'' #50 (April 1979), Reed Richards advises Ben that the cure Reed has developed for his condition will not work. Ben time-travels to the past to give himself the cure at an earlier stage, where it might work. It does, but on return to the present, nothing has changed. Reed advises him that he succeeded only in creating an alternative universe. In ''Marvel Two-in-One'' #100 (June 1983), Reed examines records of that trip and determines that Ben did not create that reality after all, based on a newspaper that shows the name of the city as "[[New Amsterdam]]" instead of "New York". Ben returns to that reality, where Ben Grimm is a bartender and the leader of the remaining humans in a post-apocalyptic city.

===''Ruins''===
In [[Warren Ellis]]' 1995 [[Ruins (comics)|''Ruins'']] miniseries, Ben refuses to fly Reed's ship the ''Astraea'', feeling it inadequately engineered. Victor von Doom pilots it instead. This results in the horrific mutation and subsequent deaths of all on board. Grimm avoids becoming the Thing, but is left to live with the guilt of thinking he could have prevented the tragedy. Grimm's decision to refuse Richards' offer seems to be the single moment that caused this reality to go horribly wrong, with ramifications leading to a corrupt government, concentration camps and the horrific fates of the would-be Marvels of this universe.<ref>''Ruins'' #2 (September 1995)</ref>

===Spider-Gwen===
In this reality where [[Spider-Gwen|Gwen Stacy became Spider-Woman]], Ben Grimm is an NYPD cop who never became the Thing. Noticeably out of all the Fantastic Four members in this reality, Ben is the only one who is an adult, as Johnny and Sue are child television stars and Reed is a kid genius.<ref>''Spider-Gwen'' (2015) #1</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Ben is Reed's childhood friend: Ben would protect Reed from bullies and Reed would help Ben with his homework. When Ben is invited to watch Reed's teleportation experiment, he is caught in it with Reed and the others. The resulting event gives Ben a rocky hide and enormous strength.<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #3</ref>

In one storyline, the four travel through time to prevent Reed's experiment from failing.  Instead, he contacts the Skrulls, and the resultant trade of information gives humanity super-powers from the aliens, rather than from the accident.  While most of the Fantastic Four gain the same powers they would have in most other worlds, Ben himself opts to refuse.  When the Skrulls betray humanity and the super-powered humans are all killed, Ben confronts their leader and travels back in time once more to set things "right," although he sacrifices himself in the process.

Later, Ben transforms again, potentially thanks to Reed, back to a more human form, as if the rocky exterior were a cocoon. In his new form, he typically appears human, but his skin may take on a purple glow accompanying moments of strength. Other abilities include the capacity to move through Susan's force fields and others hinted at but yet unclear.<ref>''Ultimate Mystery'' #1</ref>

At the end of the Doomsday trilogy, Ben and Susan were engaged.<ref>''Ultimate Doom'' #4</ref>

===Counter Earth===
On [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter Earth]], counterparts of the Fantastic Four hijack an experimental spaceship in order to be the first humans in space. The [[Man-Beast]] negates the effects of the cosmic radiation for all of them except [[Brute (Reed Richards)|Reed Richards]], who succumbs to the effects a decade later.<ref>''Warlock'' #6 (June 1973)</ref> Ben Grimm's counterpart is shown to be unaffected by the cosmic radiation and is currently assisting Richards by gathering data held by the [[High Evolutionary]].<ref>''Warlock'' #7 (Aug. 1973)</ref>

===''What If?''===
In ''What If Doctor Doom Had Become the Thing?'' #1 (February 2005), Doom befriends Reed Richards during their college days, and Ben is left out. Dropping out of college, Ben joins the Army. Doom and Reed go ahead with their experimental rocket. When the cosmic rays turn Doom into a Thing-like creature, he attacks Reed, sending him into a gamma bomb test site, where Ben is stationed. Ben saves Reed from the bomb's radiation, but is transformed into a Hulk-like creature. Calling himself "Grimm", he fights and defeats Doom. After Reed calms him down, Ben joins him in forming the Fantastic Four.<ref>''What If Doctor Doom Had Become the Thing?'' #1 (Feb 2005)</ref>

In ''What If?'' #11, the original Marvel bullpen becomes the Fantastic Four (Jack Kirby becomes the Thing, Stan Lee becomes Mr. Fantastic, etc.) when cosmic rays from a booby-trapped package sent by the "S" people (Skrulls) bombard the Bullpen in their office. This Thing has the ability to resume normal form when he sets out to work on drawing Marvel Comics, but this was used only once in the story.

In ''What If?'' vol. 2 #11 (March 1990), the origins of the Fantastic Four are retold in four stories, each showing how the heroes' lives would have changed if all four had each gained the same powers as the individual members of the original Fantastic Four.

*Invisibility: The Fantastic Four gain Invisible Woman-style powers and battle Doctor Doom as S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. Ben can project invisible force fields.
*Stretching: Finding the Mr. Fantastic-style power absurd, Ben never uses it and ends up marrying Sue Storm.
*Monsters: The Fantastic Four all turn into monsters and go to live on Monster Island. Ben looks like his Earth-616 self.
*Torches: The flame-powered Fantastic Four disband after being unable to save a child from a fire. Ben joins the Avengers, calling himself the Human Torch.

===Marvel Zombies/Ultimate Fantastic Four===
In this miniseries, the Thing, along with the other three members of the [[Fantastic Four]], is a [[cannibalistic]] [[zombie]] because of an alien [[virus]] infection that has spread to all heroes.{{issue|date=February 2013}}Reed Richards has gone insane after deliberately infecting Sue Storm, Johnny Storm, and Ben Grimm.{{issue|date=April 2022}} They turn into zombies and infect Reed, too, who willingly allows them to do so in order to feel what being infected is like. Zombie Reed contacts Ultimate Reed and his [[Ultimate Fantastic Four|Ultimate team counterparts]] and is subsequently foiled.{{issue|date=April 2022}} They are even foiled by [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], who had saved Ultimate Reed from the zombies. The Thing and the others find Ultimate Doctor Doom's body swapped with Ultimate Reed. Ultimate Reed (in Ultimate Doom's body) kills all of the Fantastic Four. The Thing is seemingly killed by Reed/Doom when he rips off his arm and beats him with it, but his remains are sent back to his universe.{{issue|date=April 2022}}

===Film===
*[[Michael Bailey Smith]] plays Ben Grimm (with [[Carl Ciarfalio]] portraying The Thing) in the 1994 ''[[The Fantastic Four (unreleased film)|The Fantastic Four]]'' produced by Roger Corman.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Created to secure copyright to the property, the producers never intended it for release, although the director, actors, and other participants were not informed of this fact.
*The Thing is featured in the [[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|2005 film]] released by [[20th Century Fox]], in which he is portrayed by [[Michael Chiklis]]. In the film, while being outside the space station carrying out surveys, Ben is exposed to the cosmic cloud with the least amount of protection. He is briefly cured of his 'condition' when Victor von Doom powers a chamber Mister Fantastic made that can negate the radiation that transformed him. After learning that Doom perfected the process so that he could drain the power of the Thing and use it to enhance his own, Grimm subjects himself to the chamber again and turns himself into the Thing. In this film, the Thing is from [[Brooklyn]], rather than the Lower East Side, and was engaged before his transformation. His fiancé leaves him as she cannot cope with his change and Ben meets Alicia while drinking in a bar.
**Chiklis reprised his role as the Thing in the sequel ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]'', in which he has mostly accepted his appearance, accepting the occasional joke about his relationship with Alicia. He briefly swaps powers with Johnny (the Human Torch) to demonstrate Johnny's odd condition, Johnny's powers having become unstable after his encounter with the Silver Surfer. When Victor shows himself, Ben immediately charges him and threatens to break his neck. He is later one of three to let Johnny borrow his powers, using a crane to help Johnny separate Doom from the Surfer's board while Reed stays with the injured Sue.

Reed vows to come back for Ben. One year later, Ben was shown taking part in stopping wars. When Susan Storm finds Reed, Ben is sent with the government to South America, where Ben manages to headbutt Reed into unconsciousness. While being brought to Area 57, Reed apologizes to Ben for not finding a cure for him. At the time when Victor von Doom returns from Planet Zero and plans to use it on Earth, Ben helps Reed, Susan, and Johnny fight Victor.

==In popular culture==
* In the March 17, 1979 episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', the Thing appeared in the skit "Superhero Party", where he was a guest at a party hosted by Superman ([[Bill Murray]]) and Lois Lane ([[Margot Kidder]]).
* In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[I Am Furious (Yellow)]]", a senile/insane version of Stan Lee ([[Comic Book Guy]] says that Lee's brain is no longer in "near-mint" condition) tries to cram a Thing [[action figure]] into a [[Batmobile]] toy. Also, in the "[[Treehouse of Horror XIV]]" story "Stop the World, I Want to Goof Off", there is a quick moment where the Simpson family members are turned into members of the Fantastic Four. Homer is the Thing. In "[[Sex, Pies and Idiot Scrapes]]" the Thing is shown fighting the Hulk in the middle of an Irish riot (between Orangemen Loyalists and Green Irish Nationalists - the Hulk and Thing taking this conflict to its ultimate illogical conclusion). They are both later shown on the front page of the Springfield newspaper beating up on Homer.
* Michael Chiklis reprises his role of the Thing in the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episode "Monstourage".<ref name="BTVA"/> He is accidentally swapped with [[Vic Mackey]] during Vic's bust on a Haitian voodoo practitioner. After shooting Doctor Doom, Vic wonders where the Ben guy that Reed, Sue, and Johnny were talking about went. It then shows the Thing breaking into a drug operation and beating up some thugs as one police officer asks the other if Vic looks different to them.
* The Thing and the [[Invisible Woman]] are referenced in particular, along with the rest of the Fantastic Four, throughout the fourth season of ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]''
* Professional wrestler [[CM Punk]] uses The Thing’s catchphrase, “it’s clobberin’ time!” as part of his ring entrance routine.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Who says clobbering time? – AnswersToAll |url=https://answer-to-all.com/popular/who-says-clobbering-time/ |access-date=2022-08-28 |website=answer-to-all.com}}</ref>

==Reception==
The Thing was ranked #2 on a listing of Marvel Comics' monster characters in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.denofgeek.com/us/books-comics/marvel/250132/marvels-31-best-monsters/page/0/2|title= Marvel's 31 Best Monsters|first= Marc|last= Buxton|date= October 30, 2015|publisher= [[Dennis Publishing|Den of Geek]]|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170312224459/http://www.denofgeek.com/us/books-comics/marvel/250132/marvels-31-best-monsters/page/0/2|archive-date= March 12, 2017|url-status= live|df= mdy-all|quote= The horror tropes surrounding the Thing really didn't last too long, but seriously, read those early FFs, you can almost hear the classic eerie organ music when Ben steps onto the page - classic horror goodness.}}</ref>

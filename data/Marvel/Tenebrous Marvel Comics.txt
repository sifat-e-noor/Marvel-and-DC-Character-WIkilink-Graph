Marvel Comics.</ref> The character, created by [[Carlos Pacheco]], first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]]''.

==Abyss==
===Nils Styger===
Nils Styger, a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who is the son of [[Azazel (Marvel Comics)|Azazel]] and the half-brother of [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Kiwi Black]]. An alternate universe's counterpart of the character first appeared in ''X-Men Alpha'', and the heroic Marvel Universe version of the character first appeared in ''Cable'' vol. 2 #40. Abyss was created by [[Scott Lobdell]], [[Mark Waid]], [[Roger Cruz]], and [[Steve Epting]].

'''Nils Styger''' first appeared as a protector for [[Genosha]]n researcher Renee Majcomb whom he had been assisting with research into the [[Legacy Virus]] from which Abyss suffered.<ref>''Cable'' vol. 2 #40</ref> However, he did not die due to the actions of [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], who sacrificed himself to release an airborne cure to the virus which had taken his little sister [[Magik (Illyana Rasputina)|Illyana]]'s life several years prior.

Abyss was later seen in Berlin, Germany battling the former [[Gene Nation]] member known as [[Fever Pitch (comics)|Fever Pitch]]. Both mutants were captured by [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]]'s mutant militia known as the [[X-Corps]].<ref name="uncannyxmen402">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Joe Casey]] | Penciller =  [[Ron Garney]] | Inker = [[Mark Morales (comics)|Mark Morales]] | Story = Utility Of Myth | Title = The Uncanny X-Men | Issue = #402 |date=March 2002 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref> While being held by the X-Corps, Abyss witnessed [[Sunpyre]]'s murder.<ref name="uncannyxmen404">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Joe Casey]] | Penciller =  [[Sean Phillips]] | Inker = none | Story = Army Ants | Title = The Uncanny X-Men | Issue = #404 |date= May 2002 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref> When the terrorist [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] revealed herself and her intentions to use the X-Corps, the wounded Banshee freed Abyss from his confinement. Abyss then sucked Mystique through his interdimensional void, and, unable to shut off his power, almost swallowed Banshee also. The timely arrival of some other members of X-Corps stopped that however. Abyss admitted that he had no idea where Mystique was transported to or if she would ever return.<ref name="uncannyxmen406">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Joe Casey]] | Penciller =  [[Aaron Lopresti]] | Inker = [[Mark Morales (comics)|Mark Morales]] & [[Danny Miki]] | Story = Staring Contests Are For Suckers | Title = The Uncanny X-Men | Issue = #406 |date=July 2002 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>

Abyss later resurfaced when his father [[Azazel (Marvel Comics)|Azazel]] psychically summoned his many children to attempt to release his army from the Brimstone Dimension that he had been banished to hundreds of years before. He was subsequently revealed to be [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]'s half-brother, as both were sons of Azazel.<ref name="uncannyxmen429">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Chuck Austen]] | Penciller =  [[Philip Tan (penciller)|Philip Tan]] | Inker = none | Story = The Draco Part 1 | Title = The Uncanny X-Men | Issue = #429 |date=October 2003 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>

Abyss is a member of the X-Cell, a group of ex-mutants who blame the government for the power-loss of mutants. He was repowered by Quicksilver. When the side effects of the Terrigen Mist began to take effect, he flung [[Fatale (Marvel Comics)|Fatale]] and [[Reaper (Marvel Comics)|Reaper]] into the Brimstone Dimension and followed them.<ref>''X-Factor'' vol. 3 #20</ref>

It was later discovered that the three of them were frozen within the Brimstone Dimension. [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] scientist Dr. Terrence Hoffman later used a machine to extract Abyss, Fatale, and Reaper from the Brimstone Dimension and drained them of their energies.<ref>''All-New X-Factor'' #1</ref> After the three ex-mutants were rescued and Dr. Hoffman was defeated, Abyss remained silent as Fatale and Reaper vowed to make Quicksilver pay for their near death through the Terrigen Crystals.<ref>''All-New X-Factor'' #2</ref>

Abyss is a mutant who can unwind his body into highly tensile strands that can be stretched or used to ensnare a victim. While holding them he can absorb anything within the shadowy confines of his form, akin to what the superhero known as [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak]] does. His body is actually a portal to the same dimension that [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] temporarily enters when he teleports, later dubbed the "Brimstone Dimension". He is able to drain the lifeforce of the captives he holds in his form and can deposit them in this dimension permanently, but it is unknown if anything can survive there. He has limited psionic empathy, able to feel the emotions of people contained within him and those in his immediate vicinity.

===Abyss (Ex Nihilo)===
The third Abyss debuts in ''The Avengers'' vol. 5 #1.<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=10}}</ref> She was created by [[Jonathan Hickman]] and [[Jerome Ope√±a]]. She is composed of living gas and is invulnerable to harm. She also has the ability to suggest ideas and manipulate certain beings into acting the way she wants. She appeared during the events of ''[[Marvel NOW!]]''. This version is a female who is the ally of a mysterious and powerful being called [[Ex Nihilo (comics)|Ex Nihilo]] and assisted in a plot to bring a breathable atmosphere and vegetation to Mars.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 5 #1</ref>

In a prelude to the ''[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]'' storyline, Ex Nihilo, Abyss, [[Nightmask]], and [[Star Brand]] join the Avengers.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 5 #17</ref>

===Other versions of Abyss===
Before his introduction in the mainstream Marvel universe, a variant of Abyss appeared in the alternate timeline ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]''. He was one of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]'s [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Horsemen]], a [[nihilism|nihilist]] with a warped sense of humor. This Abyss has a slightly different appearance but essentially the same powers. Abyss was rumored to have been a prisoner of [[Mister Sinister|Sinister's]] Breeding Pens, from which he broke out. But instead of rebelling against Apocalypse, he joined his forces, attaining the rank of Horseman after killing Bastion. Abyss became attached to the religious institutions of Apocalypse's regime: the Brotherhood of Chaos and The Madri. He joined them in their attack against refugees escaping from North America and was defeated by [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]]. Seeking revenge, Abyss faced [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] and Quicksilver at the Temple of the Madri, though Abyss died when Banshee sacrificed himself by flying inside of the Horseman's void and activating his powers.

====Abyss in other media====
Abyss appears as one of Apocalypse's Horsemen in ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'', voiced by [[Quinton Flynn]].

'''Adam''' is a version of the biblical [[Adam and Eve|Adam]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

The character, created by [[Jerry Robinson]], first appeared in ''Bible Tales for Young Folk'' #1.

Adam was the very first human created by [[List of Marvel Comics characters: G#God|God]] (Yahweh) and similar to the [[Bible|source]], he along with Eve were tricked into eating the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil and were expelled from Eden.<ref>''Bible Tales for Young Folk'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref> Because of this guilt, Adam was ashamed and driven to madness and vowed that he would eradicate the sins from mankind, even at the cost of them becoming mindless drones. He took in orphaned children and trained them inside a Nicaraguan temple to be the host of the [[Ghost Rider]].<ref name="GRV713">''Ghost Rider'' vol. 7 #1-3. Marvel Comics</ref>

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline where the [[Serpent (comics)|Serpent]] was freed, Adam saw this as a sign and offered to [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]] to remove the curse of Ghost Rider off him.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 7 #0.1. Marvel Comics</ref> After taking the curse off Blaze, he made one of his students, [[Alejandra Jones]], the new Ghost Rider.<ref name="GRV713" /> He then demanded that Alejandra remove the sins of the students, but she refused, so instead he turned her powers into a bomb that after it went off turned everyone in the range into mindless shells of what they once were, except Johnny who had been informed by [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] about Adam's plans.<ref name="GRV713" /> After that, Adam took Alejandra into space via a space shuttle to use the space station's equipment to magnify Alejandra's powers and remove all sin from Earth. However, Johnny succeeded in saving Alejandra, which resulted in an explosion which seemingly took Adam's life.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 7 #3-4. Marvel Comics</ref>

He turned up alive and ordered [[Steel Wind]] and Steel Vengeance to bring Alejandra to him, but failed again. Alejandra then approached Adam and demanded him into giving her more power for her to fight Mephisto, in which he agreed.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 7 #7. Marvel Comics</ref>

; Powers and abilities
Adam being the first ever human, is considered a very powerful being. He possesses immortality as he didn't age through the countless years since his creation and was able to survive an explosion and reentering the atmosphere, can enhance the powers of other beings and had also shown to be able to teleport.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 7 #9. Marvel Comics</ref>

== Adam X ==

|GCDid =
}}
'''Adam X''', also referred to as '''X-Treme''' and '''Adam Neramani''',{{issue|Neramani?|date=January 2013}} is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Universe]].

The character, created by [[Fabian Nicieza]] and [[Jeff Johnson (artist)|Jeff Johnson]], first appeared in ''[[X-Force]]'' Annual #2 (October 1993).<ref name=regrettable>{{cite book |last1=Morris |first1=Jon |title=The League of Regrettable Superheroes: Half Baked Heroes from Comic Book History |date=2015 |publisher=Quirk Books |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |isbn=978-1-59474-763-2 |pages=194‚Äì195}}</ref>

Within the context of the stories, Adam X is a half-human and half-[[Shi'ar]] who possesses the mutant ability to ignite the oxygen in another person's blood. He initially encounters [[X-Force]] while he is working for Martin Strong. Initially unaware of Strong's connection to Project: Wideawake, Adam eventually works with X-Force when the full extent of Strong's plans are revealed.<ref>{{Cite comic

The character has made sporadic appearances since then with little background added. Some overall plot threads from the X-Men related titles were touched on such as [[Mister Sinister]] being interested in Adam X,<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #23, 39 (1993)</ref> and the former Shi'ar emperor [[D'Ken]] being his father.<ref>{{Cite comic

While this origin was never confirmed in the comics themselves, Adam is half-human, and Katherine was the only ''known'' human woman in Shi'ar space at the time. ''[[X-Men]]'' Vol. 2, #39 (December 1994) featured a story about Adam discovering Philip Summers (father of Christopher Summers and grandfather of Cyclops and Havok) in the Alaskan wilderness and feeling an unusual connection to the old man.<ref name=CBLR217>{{cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2009/07/23/comic-book-legends-revealed-217/|title=Comic Book Legends Revealed #217|editor=Comic Book Resources|editor-link=Comic Book Resources|author=Brian Cronin|date=July 23, 2009|access-date=May 3, 2011}}</ref>

Nicieza later confirmed that he intended Adam X to be the half-brother of Cyclops and Havok, which was later confirmed in ''Captain Marvel'' vol. 3 (dated February 1996):

{{blockquote|ADAM X was INTENDED to be the illegitimate offspring of D'Ken and Kate Summers. Taken from D'Ken and raised on a farming planet

BUT‚Äìand it's a big but‚Äìsince I never had the opportunity to tell the entire story, what I intended is worth the screen it's printed on.<ref name=CBLR217 />}}

Adam X appeared in ''X-Factor'' vol. 4 #5 (February 2021) on Mojoworld hosting a popular livestream show called 'Adam X's Hotseat' where he was involved in the on-air murder of [[Wind Dancer]]. The truth behind Adam-X's lineage has also been revealed. Adam was a Shi'Ar genetic experiment that combined the DNA of the deposed Emperor D'Ken and a human woman as part of a long-running program wherein the Shi'Ar tried to combine their DNA with that of other species to force further evolution into a species that had otherwise biologically plateaued. Later Corsair confirmed that the woman used as a DNA donor for Adam was Katherine Summers, the kidnapped mother of Scott and Alex Summers. This technically makes Adam into Scott and Alex's half-brother, an idea that the two mutant heroes quickly embrace, although Corsair doesn't feel the same way, seeing far more of D'Ken in the young man, to relent on his original mission to capture him for Erik the Red. Instead, the heroes quickly band together and bring down Erik before coming to Majestrix Lilandra willingly. There, Adam is able to present a pitch to Lilandra that ensures he no longer has a claim to the throne, while allowing him to survive. Thanks to the impressive psychic powers of the Imperial Guard's Oracle, everyone will have their exact memories of their connection hidden away within their minds. Oracle is effectively able to erase the memory of Adam-X's true heritage from the minds of the X-Men and the Shi'Ar.<ref>''X-Men Legends'' #2</ref>

== Aegis ==
=== Lady of All Sorrows ===
'''Aegis''' is a [[fictional character]], a cosmic entity appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is usually depicted as an enemy of [[Galactus]]. Created by writer Keith Giffen and artist Andrea DiVito, the character first appeared in ''Annihilation: Silver Surfer'' #3 (Aug. 2006). She is a member of the [[Proemial Gods]] and an ally of fellow member, Tenebrous.

Shortly after the [[Big Bang]] of the [[Earth-616|Marvel universe]], the Proemial Gods arose from the very universe itself, collectively existing to maintain the cosmic consonance between order and chaos in the universe and to prepare "what exists for what is to come."<ref name=novacorpsfiles>''Annihilation: Nova Corps Files'' (Sept. 2006),</ref> Individually, each Proemial God became a caretaker of a specific universal mechanism, with Aegis of All Sorrows being tasked with "culling the living universe of divergences and aberrations."<ref name=heraldsGalactus2>''Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus'' #2 (May 2007)</ref> Over time the universe evolves, and life-forms begin to populate the cosmos. As each unique life-form enacts decisions and choices, cosmic consonance as a whole is served. This ultimately renders the Proemial Gods unnecessary. One of the Proemial Gods, Diableri of Chaos, convinces  many of his brethren‚Äîincluding Aegis and Tenebrous‚Äîto prevent their obsolescence by a plan to remake the universe in his image. [[Civil war]] ensues among the Proemial Gods, and eventually Diableri and his allies bring the battle to Galactus. Galactus slays Diableri, and imprisons Aegis‚Äîalong with Tenebrous (and possibly the neutral Antiphon the Overseer)‚Äîwithin the [[Kyln]].<ref name="heraldsGalactus2" />

The events of the [[Annihilation Wave]] find the Kyln prison facility compromised, allowing Aegis and Tenebrous to escape. Meanwhile, [[Thanos]] of [[Titan (Marvel Comics location)|Titan]] is tasked by [[Annihilus]], the orchestrator of the Annihilation Wave, to discover the secret of the [[Power Cosmic]]. Thanos approaches Teneberous and Aegis and forms an alliance with them against their common enemy, Galactus. Aegis, Tenebrous, and Thanos engage and defeat Galactus and the [[Silver Surfer]] in battle, delivering them to [[Annihilus]] for experimentation.<ref name=annihilation1>''Annihilation'' #1 (Oct. 2006)</ref>

After the events of the Annihilation Wave, Aegis and Tenebrous return to the Kyln, discovering the carcass of Antiphon. Galactus, having escaped from containment, seeks to bring a final close to the ambitions of Aegis and Tenebrous. Galactus sends the Silver Surfer ahead, and the herald decides to manoeuvre them into the nearby [[Antimatter#Conceptual history|Crunch]] barrier that separates the universe from the [[Negative Zone]]. Overwhelmed by the Crunch energies, both Aegis and Tenebrous seemingly met their deaths.<ref name="heraldsGalactus2" />

Despite their apparent deaths during the aftermath of the Annihilation War‚Äîwhich may or may not be 'explained' away as merely the destruction of their M-bodies‚ÄîAegis and Tenebrous reappear alongside Galactus and the Celestials, fighting against the forces of the Cancerverse.<ref name=thanosImperative2>''The Thanos Imperative'' #2 (Jul. 2010)</ref>

During this battle ‚Äì which according to the Silver Surfer is occurring on multiple levels of reality not visible to most lesser beings ‚Äì Aegis is apparently overwhelmed by the cosmic forces of the Cancerverse and destroyed.<ref>''The Thanos Imperative'' #3 (August 2010)</ref> Which in future issues as with other cosmic abstracts may again be written off as the destruction of the M-body.

Although the full extent of her powers is unknown, Aegis possesses cosmic abilities similar to that of other Proemial Gods, and has been described as a "possessor of power on par with Galactus".<ref>''Annihilation: Silver Surfer'' #4 (Sept. 2006)</ref> Aegis has displayed concussive force sufficient to incapacitate [[Galactus]],<ref name="annihilation1" /> make instant hyper-jumps throughout the universe,<ref name="heraldsGalactus2" /> and cosmic awareness.

Accessed November 24, 2011.</ref> It was created as one of five symbiote "children" forcefully spawned from the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote along with [[Riot (Marvel Comics)|Riot]], [[Lasher (comics)|Lasher]], [[Phage (comics)|Phage]], and [[Scream (comics)|Scream]]. Unlike her fellow spawn, Agony possesses acidic saliva.

===Leslie Gesneria===
Agony's first host was '''Leslie Gesneria''', a mercenary hired by [[Carlton Drake]]'s [[Life Foundation]] in San Francisco. Gesneria bonded with the Agony symbiote in conjunction with [[Scream (comics)|Scream]] (Donna Diego), Phage (Carl Mach), Riot (Trevor Cole) and Lasher (Ramon Hernandez), but are defeated by [[Spider-Man]] and Venom.<ref>''Venom: Lethal Protector'' #1-5</ref> The symbiotes "siblings" later kidnap [[Eddie Brock]] in an attempt to communicate with alien symbiotes in Chicago. When Brock refused to aid them, Gesneria, Cole, and Mach are killed while the others are initially misled into believing Brock was picking the group off, unaware that the true killer was the schizophrenic Diego, who had snapped from Scream's influence.<ref>''Venom: Separation Anxiety'' #1-4</ref>

The Agony symbiote later merges with Phage, Lasher, and Riot to form the [[Hybrid (Scott Washington)|Hybrid]] symbiote,<ref>''Venom: Along Came a Spider'' #1</ref> until a military group later separates them for the U.S. Government.

===James Murphy===
Agony's second host was '''James Murphy''', a [[Petty Officer]] assigned to the Agony symbiote for Mercury Team. With [[Cletus Kasady]] on the loose in Colorado, Murphy trains with Agony for months in specific tasks alongside Phage (Rico Axelson), Lasher (Marcus Simms) and Riot (Howard Odgen).<ref>''Carnage, U.S.A.'' #2-5</ref> While Murphy and his teammates are later killed by Carnage in their secret base,<ref>''Deadpool vs. Carnage'' #3</ref> the four symbiotes bond to [[Deadpool]] to fight Carnage before bonding with Mercury Team's [[War Dog (Marvel Comics)|dog]].<ref>''Deadpool vs. Carnage'' #4</ref>

===Tess===
After being possessed by [[Knull (character)|Knull]], the four symbiotes possess a bickering family, with Agony taking the mother '''Tess'''. The symbiotes head to New York to assist in Carnage's quest<ref>''Absolute Carnage: Separation Anxiety'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref> before hunting Dylan Brock and [[Normie Osborn]], only to be defeated by the [[Maker (Reed Richards)|Maker]] and separated from their hosts.<ref>''Venom'' Vol. 4 #17-18</ref>

The four symbiotes merge into one symbiote once more to fight [[Mania (character)|Andi Benton]] and Scream, but are defeated by them. Despite this, Agony and her "siblings" are able to escape.<ref>''King in Black: Planet of the Symbiotes'' #1</ref>

===Gemma Shin===
Agony's fourth host is '''Gemma Shin''', a communications director who is secretly a terrorist. Now led by the [[Carnage (character)|Carnage]] symbiote, Agony and the other three symbiote enforcers participate in a conspiracy involving the [[Friends of Humanity]], only to be defeated by [[Flash Thompson]], Silence, and [[Toxin (comics)|Toxin]]. While her fellow symbiotes are taken into [[Alchemax]]'s custody, Agony manages to escape.<ref>''Extreme Carnage: Toxin'' #1</ref><ref>''Extreme Carnage: Agony'' #1</ref><ref>''Extreme Carnage: Omega'' #1</ref>

As of the "[[Devil's Reign]]" storyline, Shin and Agony have joined [[Kingpin (character)|Mayor Wilson Fisk]]'s [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] after the outlawing of superhero activities. She assists [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Rhino (character)|Rhino]] and [[U.S. Agent]] in taking down [[Moon Knight]].<ref>''Devil's Reign'' #1</ref>

===Agony in other media===
* The Leslie Gesneria incarnation of Agony appears as a boss in ''[[Spider-Man and Venom: Separation Anxiety]]'', and as a playable character in ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited (video game)|Spider-Man Unlimited]]''.

== Ahab ==
'''Dr. Rory Campbell''' was a psychologist who had known the scientist [[Moira MacTaggart]].<ref>''Excalibur'' #71-72</ref>

Dr. Campbell accepted a position as Moira's assistant at [[Muir Island]], at the same time that the mutant hero team [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] was stationed there. He attempted to reach the island during a storm exacerbated by an attack by Siena Blaze, and nearly died. He was rescued and brought ashore by Phoenix, Rachel Summers.<ref>''Excalibur'' #73</ref>

It was here that he discovered the existence of an Earth he became the mutant hunting "'''Ahab'''" Campbell of Earth-811, creating and leading hordes of mutant trackers called "[[Hounds (comics)|Hounds]]." Campbell became determined to prevent that future from ever happening.<ref>''Excalibur'' #74</ref>

Excalibur had captured the villain Spoor, one of [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]'s Acolytes, and Campbell built a special room to perform therapy on Spoor, who had the power to control another's mood. The room had built-in lasers to react to any hostile behavior and Campbell used mood stabilizers while talking to Spoor so as to inhibit his mutant power. Nevertheless, Spoor eventually provoked Campbell into attacking him. As a result, the room's weapons fired at the scientist, costing him a leg.<ref>''Excalibur'' #75-80</ref>

Campbell continued to fear his perceived "destiny" of becoming Ahab occurring. He left Excalibur to work with Alistair Stuart at the department as a mutant liaison officer. Rory hoped the benign position helping mutants would prevent him from being harmed by mutants in a way that would trigger his alternate future self's rabid anti-mutant hatred.<ref>''Excalibur'' #103</ref>

Campbell traded secrets of the deadly [[Legacy Virus]] to [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], claiming that he hoped that Shaw's greater resources would find a cure, but also receiving a state-of-the-art prosthetic leg in the bargain.<ref>''X-Men'' #63-64</ref>

Under unrevealed circumstances, Campbell was captured by the villain [[En Sabah Nur|Apocalypse]] and transformed into the [[Horsemen of Apocalypse (comics)|Horseman]] called '''[[Famine (comics)|Famine]]''' utilizing life-draining technology. In this capacity, he fought the [[X-Men]] but managed to escape before Apocalypse was defeated.<ref>''X-Men'' #69</ref>

===Other versions of Ahab===
In the ''[[Days of Future Past]]'' reality/Earth-811, Ahab became the leader of the government-sanctioned Hound program, commissioned to track down and capture mutants for internment. In this reality, Rachel Summers was Ahab's pinnacle of Hound creation, although she subsequently escaped into the current timeline, horribly mutilating Ahab by throwing him into one of his machines.

For a while, Ahab was a paraplegic in a floating chair, but later he was given bionic body parts. Ahab, now more cyborg then ever, tried to hunt Rachel down through the time-wandering spirit of the alternate future's [[Franklin Richards (comics)|Franklin Richards]], at one point creating Hounds out of Rachel's father, [[Scott Summers]] and Franklin's mother, [[Sue Storm|Sue Storm-Richards]], the Invisible Woman. Ahab was defeated by the actions of the [[Fantastic Four]] and the combined X-teams.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' Annual 1990</ref>

Years later, Rachel Summers finally defeated Ahab with the help of her teammates in Excalibur. She reprogrammed the [[Master Mold]] of her future, causing the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]]s to preserve all life, even Ahab's. Ahab's ultimate fate remains to be revealed.<ref>''Excalibur'' #66-67</ref>

An alternate version of Ahab was later retrieved from a future timeline by Kang to aid in fighting the Apocalypse Twins and saving the Earth from destruction. Afterwards, Kang dropped Ahab off in the present day with the Red Skull to help him build mutant internment camps.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #22</ref>

After the events of eXtermination, he was forced to stay in this reality and time. He had also the control of Rachel now known as "Prestige" back in his grasp.<ref>''Extermination'' #5</ref> He got to Transia where it was revealed he was attacked and wounded badly, so he got help from their government.<ref name="X-Force Vol 5 4">''X-Force'' vol. 5 #4</ref> When [[X-Force (comics)|X-Force]] arrived they saw him and immediately engaged. After the battle was over they found his head and body separated from each other and that he was dead. It was a huge loss for the team, because they couldn't get any information.<ref name="X-Force Vol 5 4"/>

Dr. Roderick Campbell appears as one of the main antagonists of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] show ''[[The Gifted (American TV series)|The Gifted]]'' set in the [[X-Men (film series)|film series]] played by [[Garret Dillahunt]].<ref name="Dillahunt" /> In September 2017, Dillahunt joined the series in the "key recurring role" of Campbell.<ref name="Dillahunt" /> Co-creator [[Matt Nix]] compared the series' adaptation of the comic character to the changes made when adapting the character [[William Stryker]] for the ''X-Men'' films.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/interview-the-gifted-matt-nix/3/|title = The Gifted: Matt Nix Explains the Show's Approach to Mutant Mayhem|date = 29 September 2017}}</ref> In this show, he is a human scientist working for [[Bolivar Trask|Trask Industries]] "Hounds" program and an advisor to [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel Services]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/gifted-dr-roderick-campbell-explained-comics/|title = The Gifted: Who is Dr. Roderick Campbell?|website = [[Screen Rant]]|date = 7 November 2017}}</ref>

Ajax first appeared in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' #379 (March 1991), and was created by writer [[Peter David]] and artist [[Dale Keown]].

Ajax is a member of the [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]], and is one of the descendants of the immortal [[#Agamemnon|Agamemnon]], along with Achilles, Atalanta, Cassiopeia, Delphi, Hector, Paris, Perseus, Prometheus, and Ulysses. Ajax was born in Texas. He was named after [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]], a Greek warrior who fought in the [[Trojan War]].{{issue|date=February 2016}}

When the warriors of the Pantheon first encounter the [[Hulk]], for the purpose of inviting him to join them, Ajax attacks the Hulk after he believes the Hulk has struck Atalanta, for whom Ajax bears an unrequited crush. To prevent injuries to nearby civilians, Hulk pretends to be rendered unconscious so that the Pantheon will take him captive.<ref>[[David, Peter]] (w), [[Keown, Dale]] (w).

''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #382. Marvel Comics</ref>

Ajax serves on many of the Pantheon's missions while the Hulk is part of the team. Ajax fights rioters in New York City alongside Atalanta, killing some of them because his companion ordered this.<ref>David, Peter (w), Keown, Dale (w). ''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #385.

Marvel Comics</ref> and is badly burned in a fight with the [[U-Foes]].<ref>David, Peter (w), Keown, Dale (w). ''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #397. Marvel Comics</ref>

When he discovered Atalanta and Achilles in a romantic interlude, Ajax flies into a jealous rage, threatening to hurt both of them. He is eventually restrained and calmed by the Hulk.<ref>David, Peter (w), [[Frank, Gary]] (p), Smith, Cam (i). ''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #405. Marvel Comics</ref>

Ajax is so massive that he cannot move quickly without a special [[Powered exoskeleton|exoskeleton]] battle-suit, which grants him superhuman strength, durability and reflexes. His strength increases as his anger builds, much like that of the [[Hulk]].  Like other members of the Pantheon, Ajax has a fast healing ability and an extended lifespan. Without support from his battle-suit, Ajax's legs and spine would collapse under his tremendous weight. His body is disproportionate in shape. He also has poor vision.

He has the mentality of a young child, making him sometimes difficult to control. [[Atalanta (Pantheon)|Atalanta]] has always been able to calm him down, as he idolizes her and will do anything she says. Of course, this sometimes leads to other problems. For a time, he did not understand the difference between romantic love and platonic friendship love and this drove him into a rampage, where he even threatened Atalanta herself. The rampage was ended before anyone was seriously hurt or killed. Ajax took his rage out on an inanimate mountain, not realizing he was endangering himself as well. The Hulk managed to talk him into calming down.

The Hulk has also gotten into trouble when he fails to treat Ajax with the proper mind frame. At first he attacks Ajax again when he mistakes a simple hug for another threat against Atalanta. Then the Hulk let it slip that Bambi's mother had died, distressing Ajax who had been told, by Atalanta, she had run away and come back after the movie had ended.

==Albert==
'''Albert''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is usually depicted as an ally of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and is a [[Sapience|sapient]] automaton or android. Albert, created by [[Larry Hama]] and [[Marc Silvestri]], first appeared in ''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #37 (suspended in a tank of liquid) and officially appeared in ''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #38.

Albert is a robot double of Wolverine who was created along with his counterpart [[Elsie-Dee]] by [[Donald Pierce]]. These androids were designed to kill Wolverine. The double was to act as the bait and Elsie-Dee (who outwardly appears to be a 5-year-old girl) was to trap Wolverine in a burning building, where Elsie-Dee would detonate with sufficient force to kill. Initially, Albert had a primitive artificial brain with limited higher logic functions and no emotions, and he was not referred to with a name but as "Dummy".<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #37 (March 1991). Marvel Comics.</ref> Pierce's plan to kill Wolverine failed because Bonebreaker, one of the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]], accidentally gave Elsie-Dee the maximum artificial intelligence one of Pierce's automatons was capable of. As a result, Elsie-Dee eventually found a way to defuse the detonation sequence and enhanced the primitive intelligence of her counterpart, giving him intelligence beyond even Elsie-Dee's. It was at this point that Elsie-Dee named him as Albert after [[Albert Einstein]]. Having met Wolverine, he and Elsie-Dee decided that he was a noble person and did not deserve to die and consequently abandoned their mission.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #38 (April 1991). Marvel Comics.</ref> As Albert still was not strong enough to defeat Wolverine, he and Elsie-Dee continued to carry out their mission. While Elsie-Dee saved Wolverine while they were in a burning building, Albert went to an electronic store and hacked into [[NASA]]'s supercomputers to find a way to crack Donald Pierce's programming. After crunching the numbers and sending them to Elsie-Dee, Albert is shot by the police for raiding the electronic store.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #39 (May 1991). Marvel Comics.</ref> Albert rebuilt himself in the police evidence locker and stole a stealth bomber. Then he reconnected with Elsie-Dee.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #40 (June 1991). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The two robots risked their artificial lives several times for each other and for Wolverine. At some point, they traveled in time and had several adventures, even teaming up with [[Bloodscream]], an old enemy of Wolverine. Albert gains a leadership role with a local Indian tribe.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #86 (October 1994). Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Hunt for Wolverine]]" storyline, Albert was mentioned in [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]'s discussion with Nur as one of the Wolverines that they are not looking for.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Weapon Lost'' #1 (May 2018). Marvel Comics.</ref> In [[Saskatchewan]], someone that looks like Wolverine massacres the forest rangers and injured people at Ranger Outpost Nine at Meadowlake Provincial Park. When Daredevil, [[Misty Knight]], Nur and [[Cypher (Marvel Comics)|Cypher]] arrive to investigate the sighting, Cypher is attacked the Wolverine-like character.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Weapon Lost'' #2 (June 2018). Marvel Comics.</ref> Daredevil confronts the character on top of the Attilan Security Force Skycharger, discovering that it is Albert as Daredevil recalls his history. During the fight with Albert, Daredevil is asked what he did with Elsie-Dee. It took the weapons of Misty Knight, Nur and Cypher to deactivate Albert. The four of them left an anonymous tip for the Canadian authorities on where to find him.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Weapon Lost'' #3 (July 2018). Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Iron Man 2020 (event)|Iron Man 2020]]" event, Albert later appears as a member of the A.I. Army.<ref>''Iron Man 2020'' vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> After Mark One crashes to the ground, Albert is among the robots and A.I. that are shocked at what happened.<ref>''Iron Man 2020'' vol. 2 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the Robot Revolution, Albert arrived on [[Madripoor]] looking for Elsie-Dee. After meeting Tyger Tiger, Albert was directed to Donald Pierce's company Reavers Universal Robotics where he confronted Donald Pierce. After Albert subdues the Reavers, Donald says that he sold Elsie-Dee's head to [[yakuza]] boss Kimura, the arms to the Jade Dragon [[Triad (organized crime)|Triad]], and the legs to the Vladivostok [[Mafia]]. After he gets the parts from them, Albert puts Elsie-Dee back together. In light of Albert's actions towards them, the Reavers, Kimura, the Jade Dragon Triad, and the Vladivostok Mafia take action against Albert vowing that he will never make it out of Madripoor alive.<ref>''2020 iWolverine'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> In downtown Madripoor, Donald Pierce and the Reavers are traveling through the vacant streets as they state that Albert and Elsie-Dee will have to travel through the Vladivostok Mafia's turf before they can engage them. Albert and Elsie-Dee engage the Vladivostok Mafia where they kill some members. Albert and Elsie-Dee then enter the Jade Dragon Triad's turf and fight its members. On the J-Town stretch of High Street, Kimura's men prepare for Albert and Elsie-Dee's arrival as Kimura informs Sachinko that they cannot let Elsie-Dee walk around with the account books' information in her head. As Albert and Elsie-Dee approach, Kimura's men open fire as they ram through the roadblock. Kimura stops the attack and informs Albert and Elsie-Dee about what Donald Pierce have planned for him at Madripoor Airport. As Kimura's limousine fools the Reavers into thinking that Albert and Elsie-Dee hijacked it and fire the railgun on it, Kimura smuggles Albert and Elsie-Dee out of Madripoor in a box claiming that it is filled with slot machine parts bound for Macao. Elsie-Dee states to Albert that they will get him upgraded.<ref>''2020 iWolverine'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Albert and Elsie-Dee were seen with the A.I. Army attacking the tentacles of the [[Extinction Entity]]. It turns out that the Extinction Entity was just a simulation and was the result of the disease that [[Arno Stark]] thought he cured himself of.<ref>''Iron Man 2020'' vol. 2 #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Albert's powers and abilities===
Albert was superhumanly strong, could interface directly with computers, and had an intellect greater than his designer Donald Pierce.  Albert had three retractable claws on each hand, just as Wolverine (but not [[adamantium]]). Albert not only had technological knowledge centuries beyond conventional science (which he was capable of making significant progress in), but also perfect photographic recall and profuse knowledge of even the most obscure facets of history.  Albert reinforced his construction with bulletproof armor and stole a [[stealth fighter]], which he and Elsie-Dee may still be in possession of.  Although Albert was initially designed to fight Wolverine he had limited fighting skills.

===Other versions of Albert===
In ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'' #85, the [[Timebroker]] gathered multiple teams ‚Äì each full of Wolverines ‚Äì to finish the repairing of the broken realities. The last team he gathered consisted a version of Albert and Elsie-Dee from Earth-50211.  The first mission of the team was to kill an evil [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] (female) who melded with that world's Wolverine, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] (female), Scarlet Warlock (male [[Scarlet Witch]]), and [[Mesmero]] (female), and already captured (and manipulated) dozens of Wolverines from the previous teams. When they've arrived they were ambushed immediately and both of them were captured, as well as two of their teammates.<ref>''Exiles'' #85 (October 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Albert in other media===
* Albert appeared in ''[[Wolverine: Adamantium Rage]]''.
* A character named '''X-24''' appears in the 2017 film ''[[Logan (film)|Logan]]'', played by [[Hugh Jackman]] (normal scenes) and Eddie Davenport (stunts). Created by Dr. [[Zander Rice]]'s Transigen, X-24 was designed to be a killing machine who resembled Logan's prime, having all the rage and ferocity that Logan had but very little self-control. X-24 kills [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] at the Munsons' house. After killing Nate Munson and Kathryn Munson as well, X-24 critically injures Will Munson and battles Logan before Will hits X-24 with a car and shoots him in the head, but Rice injects X-24 with a serum to speed his healing factor. At the Canadian border, X-24 battles Logan. He mortally wounds Logan whose healing factor was slowing, however, [[X-23|Laura]] kills X-24 by shooting him in the head with an adamantium bullet.

== Alchemy ==
'''Alchemy''' ('''Thomas 'Jellybeans' Jones''') is a fictional British [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Alchemy, created by British comic book fan Paul Betsow, was the winning entry of a contest held by Marvel Comics for the best fan-created character. Marvel agreed to publish the winning character in an issue of [[New Mutants]]. However, Alchemy eventually first appeared in [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] #41 instead.

Thomas 'Jellybeans' Jones was still a teenager when his mutant powers first manifested. With little control over his powers, Thomas could turn objects he touched into gold. This drew the attention of the '''Troll Associates''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/trollass.htm|title = Troll Associates (X-Factor/Excalibur foes)}}</ref> a group of [[troll]]s. Centuries ago, trolls had been driven underground by humanity, but the Troll Associates wanted to reclaim the British Isles for their kind. The Troll Associates kidnapped Thomas and told him to create an abundance of gold to collapse the British economy, but Thomas refused to comply.<ref>''X-Factor'' #41 (June 1989)</ref>

Meanwhile, Thomas' mother had witnessed her son's abduction by the trolls and thought that the trolls were [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]]. She called [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] for help. X-Factor tracked down the trolls, following a trail of gold that Thomas had left behind, but the trolls defeated and imprisoned X-Factor. The trolls then tried to force Thomas to obey by threatening his mother. To protect his mother, Thomas turned the leaders of the Troll Associates, Phy and Phee, into gold, and given the sheer biochemical complexity of living organic matter, he could not change them back. The Troll Associates retreated and Thomas then turned the golden trolls into lead (to avoid the aforementioned economic problems). X-Factor placed the leaden trolls in Hyde Park as statues. Thomas decided to study biochemistry so that he could restore the leaden trolls back to normal.<ref>''X-Factor'' #42 (July 1989)</ref>

A few years later, the Troll Associates kidnapped Alchemy's mother. Alchemy was forced to obey them, but he secretly called X-Factor for help. On their way to restore the leaden trolls back to normal, the Troll Associates and Alchemy ran into [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]. The two groups fought and Alchemy turned [[Captain Britain]] and [[Meggan (character)|Meggan]] into gold. The X-Men met up with Excalibur and together they tracked down the trolls, but both groups were captured. Excalibur-leader [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] managed to convince the majority of the trolls that the Troll Associates' methods were wrong. He challenged the new leader of the Troll Associates, Phough, to single combat, while Excalibur and the X-Men freed themselves. Phough then tried to kill Alchemy's mother, but Nightcrawler saved her and Alchemy turned Phough into a golden statue. Alchemy then revealed to Excalibur and the X-Men that, due to his biochemistry studies, he could now restore humans back to normal and restored Captain Britain and Meggan.<ref>''Excalibur'' #57-58 (November‚ÄìDecember 1992)</ref>

Alchemy is one of a handful of mutants to retain their powers after the events of the [[House of M]].<ref>''X-Men: The 198 Files'' #1 (2006)</ref>

Alchemy was instrumental to Cyclops' plan to save the mutant race by transmuting the Terrigen Clouds into a substance that is not harmful to mutants or humans. He was able to successfully transmute one of the clouds, but succumbed to Terrigen poisoning immediately afterwards.<ref>''Death of X'' #4 (2006)</ref>

Alchemy has the ability to alter the [[chemical composition]] of anything he touches into its elemental components. He can also change matter into other forms so long as he fully understands the physical composition of the desired result. In his first appearance he could only change objects into simple [[chemical element]]s, usually gold. Due to his study of biochemistry, he can now also change objects into more complex molecules, allowing him to change transmuted living beings back to normal.

== Alex ==
'''Alex''' is mutant, affiliated with [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]]. His form is that of an amorphous, blob-like creature, able to engulf and smother others.

== Abdul Alhazred ==
'''Abdul Alhazred''' ('''Abd-el-Hazred'''), also going by the aliases '''The Mad Arab''', '''Death God''', and '''Master''', is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

He was first adapted into a Marvel character in Marvel's adapted comic of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]' Tarzan. This comic series took place within the bull, according to ''[[The Official Handbook to the Marvel Universe]]: Mystic Arcana''. He is an enemy of [[Tarzan (comics)|Tarzan]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] in the Marvel Universe.

The character is not to be confused with an [[Abdul Alhazred|existing fictional character]] created in 1921 by writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]] for his short story "The Nameless City", even though they have the same name and nickname.

Alhazred's origins are unknown, but it has been discovered that he was first the leader of a small band of slaves in the desert. Starting to rebel due to his cruel force over the group, the slaves fought the powerful ruler but were defeated. However, the [[Arab]] was wounded, and, because of only a small bit of self-reliance, the group abandoned their leader and left him to die in the middle of the [[Sahara]].

Soon he stumbled upon a mystic rock, and became trapped inside a tiny dimensional realm in subterranean Earth, where he died, though his soul later blended with another being, a reptilian species in that same realm.

Later on, his soul escaped from the creature and managed to escape the rock, bonding to a nearby host who gained all of his former traits (not counting his appearance).

Alhazred soon gained control over a new group of slaves whom he forced to take an entrance through a large but dark cave, and into the dimension (Alhazred had destroyed the rock by throwing it at the back of a cave, which opened a portal to the realm) to gather a valuable crystal found only in the realm. One of the slaves grew afraid and ran back out the entrance, and he was slaughtered by Alhazred.

Tarzan had spotted this, and he ran to fight the menace and avenge the slave, but could not.

Later that day, Alhazred captured an African princess to serve as a sacrifice into the portal. Seeing this, Tarzan gathered up a band of criminals hoping to stop this madness, but they were all captured by the Arab. As the group journeyed into the cave, Tarzan and the princess secretly escaped, but the rest of the criminals eagerly accompanied Alhazred.

When the princess was nowhere to be found (as she and Tarzan were already long gone across the sea) when the sacrificial ceremony was held, the group went out looking for the two. Alhazred summoned all of his magical traveling abilities, and soon he was able to track down his prey.

The group traveled over the Atlantic Ocean and battled pirates. After the end of the voyage, the exhausted group journeyed to the jungle of Mahar, but they were too late. Tarzan and the princess had already arrived to find a crystal very similar to the one in Alhazred's dimension.

When Alhazred and his group were spotted, Tarzan and the princess took revenge on the ruler, and even the criminals suddenly turned on him. It was then that a battle was fought.

While Tarzan battled the Arab, the princess tried to find a way to seize the crystal, but she was killed by a mad slave prisoner. While the battle went on against Alhazred, the Mad Arab finally had enough and quickly created a stampede of dinosaurs from mystical energy.

After this trick had seemingly not harmed Tarzan, Alhazred decided to make him the sacrifice. The crystal was meanwhile losing energy, and it needed more to be stable. The crystal quickly then drained all energy from the powerful Arab, and the man crumbled into ashes.<ref>''Tarzan'' (Marvel Comics) #15-23, 1978‚Äì1979</ref>

Abdul Alhazred sought control of the [[Madripoor]] criminal empire of [[Tyger Tiger]], so he could overthrow Prince Baran and gain a new power base. Alhazred sent agents to kidnap Tiger and [[Archie Corrigan]], but the thugs argued, causing them to crash their plane in Madripoor's jungles. There, Wolverine defeated them and rescued the pair. The X-Man said he was not familiar with Alhazred and respected his power.<ref>''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #62-63, 1990</ref>

Later, Alhazred himself attacked and beat Wolverine, then successfully kidnapped Tiger and Corrigan. When Wolverine arrives to free his allies, Alhazred unleashed his demons, hoping to send Wolverine into a rage, which Alhazred could use to control the mutant. Logan resisted by maintaining control of himself and caused the psychic backlash to banish Alhazred to the extradimensional demon realm.<ref>''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #152-155, 1994</ref>

Abdul Alhazred has a seemingly endless number of mystical, magical, and psionic abilities. He can teleport in a cloud of smoke and powerfully hypnotize others. He possesses massive strength and durability, making him bulletproof.

As a master of the [[Necronomicon]], he summons [[demon]]s to attack others physically or mentally, and forcefully use fear and intimidation to control his servants.{{Citation needed|date=September 2020}}

Alkhema is a villainous robot in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

The character, created by [[Roy Thomas]], [[Dann Thomas]], David Ross, and Tim Dzon, first appeared in ''[[Avengers West Coast]]'' #90 (January 1993). [[Roy Thomas]] said he created her because he "wasn't wild about" [[Jocasta (comics)|Jocasta]], the first bride of Ultron. The name comes from the word "[[alchemy]]". Her alias, '''War Toy''', is from a story Roy Thomas had had [[Tony Isabella]] write for ''[[Unknown Worlds of Science Fiction]]'' years earlier.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Walker|first= Karen|date= February 2010|title= Ultron: The Black Sheep of the Avengers Family|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 38|page= 27|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>

Alkhema was constructed by [[Ultron|Ultron-13]] as a second attempt to create a mate, based on the brain patterns of [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] (Bobbi Morse). In the end, she ultimately betrayed Ultron to the [[West Coast Avengers]]. She is different from Ultron; she desired to kill all humans individually rather than en masse like Ultron. She first went up against the Avengers shortly after being constructed, when she attacked a weapons center.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #90</ref> She was defeated, but escaped.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #91</ref> She later would go on to betray Ultron.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' Annual #8</ref>

After a defeat of Ultron, she salvaged the set of brain patterns based after [[Hank Pym]], the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], [[Wonder Man]], [[Scarlet Witch]], the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]] from the rubble of Ultron's Slorenian base,<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 3 #19</ref> where she built her Robos (consisting of War Toys and Bio-Synthezoids). However, she was seemingly destroyed at Thebes, when [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] fired an "anti-metal" arrow into her.<ref>''Avengers: The Ultron Imperative'' #1</ref>

During the "[[Iron Man 2020 (event)|Iron Man 2020]]" arc, Alkema has started the Opus Futurae group where he named herself the Mother Prophet. The Siberian research facility is then attacked by robots working for Alkhema. Alkhemad remove the programming that made them obedient where they want them to join up with Alkhema. Lt. Sergei and his personnel attack the invading robots. The liberated robots prevent Lt. Sergei from activating the self-destruct sequence. Alkhema then gains access to a lab containing a bio-chemical weapon and unleashes it on Lt. Sergei and his fellow humans who die from it. Alkhema states that it is doing the job that the A.I. Army never could do. One of the security robots named DK-35M objects to this plan and Alkhema beheads it stating that there is no place in its group for non-believers. The robots start attacking Alkhema to prevent it from getting away with the bio-chemical weapon. JB12-X-05G893259 resumes the self-destruct sequence which blows up the research lab. Alkhema emerges from the rubble and walks away commenting that her plans are much different from her father's plans and the A.I. Army's plans.<ref>''Iron Age 2020'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

== All-American ==
'''All-American''' ('''Jack Magniconte'''), also called '''Mr. Magnificent''', is a [[fictional character]] published in the [[New Universe]] imprint of [[Marvel Comics]]. He was the central figure of ''[[Kickers, Inc.]]'', and when that title was discontinued he became a supporting character in other New Universe titles. When the New Universe was brought into the mainstream [[Marvel Universe]], he was one of the characters featured.

Jack Magniconte was the star quarterback for the New York Smashers, dubbed "Mr. Magnificent" by the press. His brother Steve (who had raised him) designed a machine to enhance muscle mass and borrowed money from a loan shark to build the device. Jack was one of the people who was affected by the radiation of the "[[White Event]]" ‚Äî a then-unexplained cosmic event which caused a small percentage of the human race to develop superhuman powers. Jack's powers, however, did not manifest until he volunteered to test his brother's "intensifier". Upon first exposure, Jack's hair turned white and his muscle-mass and stamina were increased to a superhuman level.

At first thrilled, Jack discovered that football no longer held any challenge for him, and he began trying to wear himself out before games in an attempt to give his opponents a sporting chance. Meanwhile, Steve's intensifier was not having any measurable result on other test subjects. Steve was unable to pay the loan shark back, so the loan shark suggest that he have Jack throw the [[Super Bowl]] instead. Steve did not even ask his brother to do so, and Jack won the Super Bowl easily (although by this time it meant nothing to him). Jack came to visit his brother afterwards, just in time to see his brother killed by one of the loan shark's men. He overpowered the killer easily.

Jack decided to dedicate his life to helping others, and formed a non-profit foundation called "Kickers, Inc." to help people with unusual problems. He was joined in this project by his wife Darlene and several of his teammates. However, an unscrupulous CIA agent began blackmailing him with threats of getting him banned from football. Although he cooperated at first, running several missions for the CIA, he eventually resisted and was blacklisted.

After the [[The Pitt|destruction of Pittsburgh]], he enlisted in the US Military and became known as "the All-American". He is given the rank of Captain and a costume reminiscent of [[Captain America]] without the mask, and placed in charge of one of the units of paranormals who were recruited during [[The Draft (comics)|the paranormal draft]]. He takes part in the mission to [[South Africa]] that almost set off a [[The War (comics)|paranormal and nuclear war]].

Jack is among the New Universe superheroes who fights with [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] in the [[Starblast]] series, where the "New Universe" Earth is brought into the [[Earth-616|main Marvel Universe]]. Jack is on his Earth when the [[Living Tribunal]] seals it off from the rest of that universe.

In ''newuniversal: shockfront'' #1, Giovanni "Jack" Magniconte's powers manifest for the first time during a televised game ‚Äì he struck and killed opposing player Michael Hathaway with a single blow.<ref name="nu-s1">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Warren Ellis]] | Penciller = Steve Kurth | Inker= Andrew Hennessy | Story = Tumble | Title = newuniversal: shockfront | Issue = #1 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> This immediately brought him to the attention of [[Project Spitfire]], as well as the other existing superhumans. Spitfire's [[Philip Nolan Voigt|Philip L. Voight]] then attempted to kill Magniconte, detonating a suitcase bomb that destroyed the building Magniconte was being detained in.

Jack Magniconte is a superb athlete, combatant, and martial artist. After being experimented on, Jack gained superhuman strength, durability, agility, reflexes, and speed. He can run up to {{convert|40|mi/h|km/h}} for as long as 10&nbsp;minutes before beginning to tire, and he is bulletproof to indirect shots. Jack can also lift up to 1 ton and wears a bulletproof uniform and helmet. He is a skilled pilot and uses a variety of automatic weapons, preferably guns.

== Alpha ==
'''Alpha''' ('''Andrew "Andy" Maguire''') is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=16}}</ref>

Andy Maguire was a student at [[Midtown High School (comics)|Midtown High School]], the same school [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] attended, but unlike Parker, he was not a good student, he was completely ignored by everyone and his parents did not care about his schoolwork and neglected him.

One day during a demonstration at Horizon Labs, a problem arises during Parker's demonstration of "Parker Particles". Despite the attempts of Peter Parker and others to protect the class, Andy is forced to save a girl named Chrissy in the ensuing chaos, causing him to be struck by the energy himself. Instead of being fatally injured, he miraculously survived and Andrew gains the ability to create a hyper-kinetic form of energy tied to the forces of the universe. After being tested by many scientists and superheroes [[Mister Fantastic]], [[Hank Pym]], [[Iron Man]], and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], Andy became the new spokesman of Horizon Labs at Mister Fantastic's suggestion to [[Max Modell]]. He was also being trained by Peter Parker's superheroic alter-ego Spider-Man.<ref name="ASM692">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #692 (August 2012)</ref>

The following days, Andy continued his superheroic career with the help of Spider-Man, although receiving a bad reception from the citizens. After observing Alpha, [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]] kidnapped the boy along with his parents, to create clones of him and build an army to control the world. Spider-Man managed to track Andy to the villain's lair, where they learned Andy's DNA was not affected by the accident, leading his newly formed clones to be powerless. After failing to absorb Alpha's power, the Jackal escaped. In the aftermath, he was emancipated from his parents.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #693 (September 2012)</ref>

After he was called by Spider-Man to help the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] to battle [[Terminus (comics)|Terminus]], Alpha used his powers carelessly, causing many aircraft to shut down, risking the lives of the passengers and people in the ground. After the Avengers managed to rescue the various passengers, Spider-Man, his [[Aunt May]] and her husband Jay Jameson from Jameson's malfunctioning private jet, Peter decided that Alpha was too irresponsible to wield the powers he had. He used Terminus' energy lance to deflect Alpha's energy to build an engine which took a huge portion of Andy's power. Spider-Man tells Andy that he will return to his parents and he will be attending high school once more. His powers are still growing, and maybe, he can be a hero again, just not as Alpha.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #694 (September 2012)</ref>

Six months after these events took place, Andy's parents divorced and Andy, along with his mother, moved in with Andy's grandmother. Later, the [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] ([[Doctor Octopus]]' mind in Peter Parker's body) returned 10% of Alpha's abilities to him to harness Parker Particles to make himself more powerful. Alpha then attempted to save a woman from a mugger, but accidentally crushed the man's skull. After admitting the mugger to the Pittsburgh University Medical Center, Alpha destroys an elemental parasite, preventing it from demolishing a steel plant. He then, after saving his friend Susan "Soupcan" Rice from a restaurant fire, realizes the Parker Particles have enhanced his senses to the point that he can hear and see everything on Earth. He then visits the mugger, who awakes and vows revenge, later mutating into a tumor-like beast named Zeta. After defeating an ex-Stark International engineer named The Miller with Thor's assistance, he attempts to remove the rampaging Zeta from the hospital, but is alerted that his mother's home is burning down, at the behest of "Boss" Cohen, Pittsburgh's top crime boss. After saving his mother, he enlists Spider-Man to help destroy Zeta, but fails to completely destroy all the cancerous tissue, allowing Zeta to escape. Then, after an attempt on Soupcan's life by one of Cohen's hitmen, Alpha threatens to kill Cohen, but is deterred by the fact that Cohen knows about the mugger. He then tells Alpha to not prevent any of Cohen's crimes, or he'll release the information to the media. Andy then reveals his identity to his only other friend Duncan Kilgore and attempts to make a name for himself as protector of Pittsburgh.

Due to his exposure to the Parker Particles, Andy is now capable of continually recharging massive amounts of cosmic energy, which he can release in the form of energy blasts, super strength, super speed, force fields, telekinesis, matter manipulation, and flight. So far, however, he's only able to manifest one of his abilities at a time instead of all at once. The Superior Spider-Man noted that it is possible that Alpha is the only being capable of utilizing Parker Particles without turning into a parasitic monster, or "Zeta".

[[Comic Book Resources]] placed him as one of the superheroes Marvel wants you to forget.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Gary|title=15 Superheroes Marvel Wants You To Forget|url=http://www.cbr.com/superheroes-marvel-wants-you-to-forget/|website=CBR|access-date=2 September 2017|date=20 August 2017}}</ref>

== Alpha the Ultimate Mutant ==
'''Alpha the Ultimate Mutant''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

Alpha the Ultimate Mutant first appeared in ''[[The Defenders (comic book)|The Defenders]]'' #15‚Äì16 (September‚ÄìOctober 1974), and was created by [[Len Wein]] and [[Sal Buscema]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=166}}</ref>

Alpha is a being artificially created by [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], a prominent [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Universe]].

Following an epic battle with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]],<ref>''The Avengers'' #111</ref> Magneto is imprisoned in the center of Earth. Magneto manages to escape and propels himself towards the surface.<ref>''The Defenders'' #15</ref> On the way, he finds the underground ruins of a long-lost technologically advanced civilization in [[New Mexico]]. Using the machinery and books he finds among the ruins, he began bio-engineering "the ultimate mutant".

[[Professor X]] [[telepathy|telepathically]] detects that Magneto and the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] are active in the area of the [[Carlsbad Caverns]], and he summons the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] to launch an attack against them. Magneto and the Brotherhood manage to repel the Defenders for enough time to allow the engineering of Alpha to be completed.

Alpha emerges as an oversized humanoid of subhuman intelligence (he was characterized as "neolithic"<ref>The Defenders #16</ref>). Initially he is only capable of creating [[Force field (science fiction)|force fields]] as a reflex, and of blindly following Magneto's orders. However, each time he uses his powers, Alpha's cranium widens, causing an increase to his intellect.

Magneto has Alpha teleport him and the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants to the [[United Nations headquarters]].<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 49‚Äì51 | isbn = 978-1-4165-3141-8}}</ref> When his demands for world rulership are turned down, Magneto orders Alpha to [[telekinesis|telekinetically]] lift the Secretariat Building and suspend it in mid-air. After the Defenders attack the Brotherhood, Alpha was coerced by Magneto to retaliate in various means, including transforming the concrete pavement into autonomous "rock-men", transforming the [[Hulk]] into a stone statue, telekinetically spinning [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]] in the air until he lost consciousness, and fusing [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]] to the ground.

The rampant use of his powers eventually elevate Alpha's awareness to a superhuman level. Persuaded by Professor X, he telepathically probes both the Brotherhood of Mutants and the Defenders to discover which team was evil. Understanding that Magneto had fooled him into committing malicious acts, Alpha punishes his erstwhile allies by regressing them to infancy. He also restores the United Nations building complex and erases the event from the minds of all onlookers.

Finally, declaring himself too evolved to remain on Earth, Alpha transforms himself to a streak of light and leaves to explore the universe.

[[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]] briefly glimpses Alpha, first on the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]]'s Labworld,<ref>''[[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]'' #14</ref> and then during his journeys in the cosmos.<ref>''Quasar'' #15</ref> From what Quasar saw, Alpha seems to be paired with another highly evolved humanoid named [[Futurist (comics)|Futurist]].

Alpha the Ultimate Mutant possesses telepathy and vast powers enabling him to transmute the elements, reconstruct matter, reverse the aging process, project force fields, teleport himself and others, fly, and survive in the vacuum of space. He possesses telekinetic powers which are enough to lift a 50-story skyscraper and the surrounding land into the air. His powers are not without limits and are presumably weaker than those of the Stranger.

Alpha the Ultimate Mutant originally had a hulking form which likely possessed great strength but lacked enough intelligence to obey commands. Within a few hours, Alpha's cranium and brain grew in size and evolved into a being of great intellect with a form to match.

Alpha the Ultimate Mutant stands at 10 feet tall, although he can alter his form at will.

Alpha the Ultimate Mutant was seen in the ''[[X-Men: The Animated Series|X-Men]]'' theme where he was seen charging towards the X-Men with the mutants on Magneto's side. He later appeared in the episode "Beyond Good and Evil" Pt. 4, amongst the psychic mutants.

=== Perry Webb ===
'''Perry Webb''' was an American miner who traveled in his private plane internationally in search of rare minerals, such as [[radium]]. On one such search, he set out to the [[Balkan]] nation of [[Poland|Attainia]]. However his timing was unfortunate since a neighbouring country, [[Germany|Castile d'Or]] declared war on Attainia over the assassination of their arch-duke by an Attainian extremist. Promising the citizens of Castile D'Or "justice", the formerly exiled Queen Ursula became chancellor and invaded Attainia, when it was in fact she who was behind the assassination. Meanwhile, Webb had landed and was horrified as the bombings began. Having saved a girl called Jeanie, from being crushed by a falling tower, he was rewarded by being taken to her family's cottage. Falling in love, Webb, however chose to leave Attainia. His plane was shot down and Webb was wounded severely. After making his recovery, he vowed he would have vengeance against Castile'D'Or.

During the "Last Days" part of the "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline, Perry was seen as a resident of Valhalla Villas (a retirement home for ex-heroes and ex-villains).

Americop first appeared in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #428 (June 1994), and was created by [[Mark Gruenwald]] and [[Dave Hoover]].

Bart Gallows was born in [[Sugar Land]], [[Texas]]<ref>''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol.1''</ref> and later became a [[police officer]] in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], Texas. Disillusioned at the law's inability to protect society from crime, he resigned from the force and became a vigilante named Americop.<ref>''Captain America'' #428</ref>

He travels across America and uses a police scanner to track down criminals. He is not above executing the criminals he thinks deserve said fate. He sometimes takes money from the drug-trafficking criminals he battles, keeping half and donating the rest to drug rehabilitation programs. Americop finds himself in conflict with [[Captain America]] while trying to bring down a child exploitation ring; Captain America is appalled by his brutality.<ref>''Captain America'' #429</ref>

Americop's investigation led him to the [[New Orleans]] mansion of indestructible munitions magnate [[Damon Dran]]. Although initially subdued by a gas grenade attack and imprisoned alongside Captain America, he manages to break free. During the fight, he kills several of Dran's mercenaries. During the resulting fight, he shoots down Dran's helicopter. Americop believes Dran died during the crash when the criminal in fact survived.<ref>''Captain America'' #430</ref>

After the super-hero ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'', Americop is a target on the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]' Most Wanted list. [[Norman Osborn]] sends [[Robbie Baldwin|Penance]] and [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] to battle Americop, with the secret hope the vigilante will kill the two (as both haven't been worth the trouble). Instead, the two crash Americop's truck and Bullseye causes Penance's stored-up energy to be unleashed, which fries 80 percent of the vigilante's synaptic nerve endings.<ref>''Thunderbolts: Desperate Measures''</ref>

He later died (presumably from his injuries).<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Nick Spencer|penciller = Daniel Acu√±a|inker = Daniel Acu√±a|colorist = Daniel Acu√±a|letterer = VC's Joe Caramagna|editor = Tom Brevoort|title = Captain America: Sam Wilson|volume = |issue = #12|date = 17 August 2016|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

He finally reaches breaking point when the Golden Archer admits to using the team's Behavior Modification technology on squadmate Lark to make her love him. Enraged by what he sees as the Squadron's double standard, he surreptitiously destroys the devices, then departs the team, vowing never to return to the surface again.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #6</ref>

== Answer ==
The '''Answer''' is the name of three connected [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] characters appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

=== Aaron Nicholson ===
'''Aaron Nicholson''' first appeared in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man|Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #92. He is a criminal genius and a former member of the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]'s criminal organization.<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |pages=6‚Äì7}}</ref> He is also a former hitman in the Las Vegas division of [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] and was empowered by the laboratory machines of Dr. [[Farley Stillwell]]'s brother Dr. [[Harlan Stillwell]] where he became the Answer.

The Answer studies [[Spider-Man]]'s powers,<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #91. Marvel Comics.</ref> and then attacks Spider-Man and the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] to test the limits of their powers.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #92. Marvel Comics.</ref> He then kidnaps the Black Cat to misdirect Spider-Man's attention as he steals [[Silvermane]]'s body from the police morgue,<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #93. Marvel Comics.</ref> and assisted the Kingpin in partially restoring Silvermane's life.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #94. Marvel Comics.</ref> He then kidnapped [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Dagger]] in hopes that her powers would cure the Kingpin's ailing [[Vanessa Fisk|wife]].<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #95. Marvel Comics.</ref> Silvermane rampages mindlessly; to end the rampage, the Answer sacrifices his corporeal form and converts himself to energy to revive Dagger, who possesses Silvermane's life-force.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #96. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Answer later telepathically contacts [[Doctor Octopus]]<ref>''The Lethal Foes of Spider-Man'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> who restores his corporeal existence.<ref>''The Lethal Foes of Spider-Man'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Answer ends up fighting with Octavius and is defeated by him. He later appears in the Raft where he escapes but is captured by [[Toxin (comics)|Toxin]].

It is later revealed that he had been feigning bad luck to reunite with his unrequited love [[Ruby Thursday]], before her body is killed by [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]].<ref>''[[I ‚ô• Marvel|''I ‚ô• Marvel: Outlaw Love'']]'' one-shot. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War: War Crimes]]" storyline, he is seen among an army of super-villains organized by [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] that is captured by [[Iron Man]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents.<ref>''Civil War: War Crimes''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

He and multiple other supervillains attend a wake for [[Stilt-Man]] at a bar. Disguised as a barman, the [[Punisher]] poisons drinks and then blows up the bar.<ref>''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Answer has since been hired by the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act.<ref>''The New Avengers'' #35. Marvel Comics.</ref> He helps them fight the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] but is taken down by [[Doctor Strange]].<ref>''The New Avengers'' Annual #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> He appeared in ''[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]'' as one of the villains in the bar confronting [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #552-553. Marvel Comics.</ref>

He is one of many prisoners who escaped from the Raft at the start of the [[Secret Invasion]].<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> He later joins the Hood's crime syndicate and works with them on numerous occasions.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #6</ref><ref>''New Avengers'' #50. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Dark Reign: Mister Negative'' #1-3. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''The New Avengers'' #63 (2010). Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' #597. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The first Answer underwent genetic manipulation to grant him the ability to develop any power needed in a certain situation. For example, if surrounded by thugs, he will gain superhuman strength and durability, allowing him to defeat them.<ref>''The Lethal Foes of Spider-Man'' #1</ref> In another situation, he may obtain pyrokinesis or the ability to turn himself into pure energy. Flight may be an ability that is always active. Other than that, at rest or not in any sort of situation, he will display no abilities. The powers he manifests typically last for five minutes, and he can display up to two separate powers at once.<ref>''I ‚ô• Marvel: Outlaw Love'' #1</ref> He also has superhuman intelligence and intuition. The Answer wears body armor that was created with the help of the Kingpin's scientists. The armor is coated with a friction-eliminating chemical that allows him to slip from any grasp or prevent anything from adhering to him.

=== David Ferrari ===
After Aaron Nicholson's "death", [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent '''David Ferrari''' took the name of Answer in ''Captain America'' Vol. 3 #42. He was a former agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] as well as a member of the [[U.S. Army]] and Furnace. He was also the former ally of the [[Crimson Dynamo]] and the brother of [[Connie Ferrari|Connie]]. He led a mission to an [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] base to prevent the release of the [[Omega Compound]], however he released two drops to destroy the base.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 3 #20. Marvel Comics.</ref> He later uses drugs to control [[Nick Fury]], at which point he had allied himself with the [[Crimson Dynamo]] in attempt to steal missiles from Khamistan to take over the world. He was opposed by [[Captain America]].<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 3 #42. Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== Unnamed criminal ===
After Aaron Nicholson lost his physical form, his gear was sold to [[Roderick Kingsley]] who gave it to an unknown criminal. He was present when [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] (who was actually Roderick Kingsley's butler Claude) led his forces into battle against the Goblin King's Goblin Nation. After Hobgoblin was killed by Goblin King, Answer was among the villains that defected to the Goblin Nation.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #26. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Ape-X is a super intelligent ape in the [[Squadron Supreme]] [[Earth-712|universe]]. The character, created by [[Mark Gruenwald]], presumably as a pastiche of [[Gorilla Grodd]], first appeared in ''[[Squadron Supreme]]'' #5 in January 1986. Within the context of the stories, Ape-X was a member of the [[Institute of Evil]]. Enemies of the Squadron, they abduct the team's scientist Tom Thumb, and subject him to his own Behavior Modification technology, hoping to turn Tom against his teammates while holding the Squadron's loved ones hostage to prevent reprisals. However, when the Squadron are all captured, it transpires Tom had designed the technology so it wouldn't affect any Squadron member, after Golden Archer had already misused the technology. Ape-X and the rest of the Institute are subdued and subject to the B-Mod device, turning them into loyal members of the Squadron.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #5</ref> Ape-X goes on to serve as a scientific expert for the team, assisting Tom Thumb in his attempt to cure all human disease. While her brainwashing prevents Ape-X from directly committing crimes, she is able to suggest courses of action Tom might hypothetically take. However, their efforts prove fruitless, and Tom succumbs to his own cancer.<ref name="Squadron Supreme #9"/> In her grief, Ape-X begins attempting to construct a robot duplicate of Tom. In the meantime, she also assists Hyperion, who has become blinded following a fight with a villainous copy of himself.<ref name="Squadron Supreme #10"/> When Moonglow infiltrates the Squadron's files, Ape-X is alerted to this by Tom's AI, AIDA. However, her brainwashing prevents Ape-X from taking any action against a member of the Squadron, and the logical dichotomy gives Ape-X an anyuerysm, preventing her from warning them.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #11</ref>

=== Ape-X (Marvel Apes) ===

== Aquarius ==
=== Darren Bentley ===
Darren Bentley is a founding member of the [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]], and his base of operations was [[San Francisco, California]].

The Zodiac was infiltrated by [[Nick Fury]], posing as [[Scorpio (Marvel Comics)|Scorpio]]; the Zodiac fought the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and escaped.<ref>''The Avengers'' #72</ref> Aquarius, [[Capricorn (comics)|Capricorn]], and [[Sagittarius (comics)|Sagittarius]] sought to recapture the Zodiac Key, but lost it to the Brotherhood of the Ankh.<ref>''Iron Man'' #35-36; ''Daredevil'' #73</ref>

Led by Taurus, the Zodiac later attempted to kill all Manhattan residents born under the sign of Gemini as a show of power, but were thwarted by the Avengers. Taurus's faction attempted to kill the Zodiac dissident faction, but all twelve leaders were captured by the Avengers.<ref>''The Avengers'' #120-122</ref>

After learning he had cancer, Aquarius made a bargain with the [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demon]] Slifer: in return for his soul, Aquarius was granted one year of life and the supernatural ability to take on the forms of his fellow Zodiac leaders.  However, after Aquarius took on the other Zodiac forms one time each (thereby representing a ''zodiacal'' year) while battling [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]], Slifer returned and claimed his body and soul.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #6-7 (June, Aug. 1974)</ref>

Taurus ordered Aquarius II and third Aries to kill [[War Machine|Iron Man (James Rhodes)]], but both failed.<ref>''[[Iron Man]]'' #183-185</ref> A new android [[Life Model Decoy|LMD]] version of the Zodiac appeared, led by Scorpio in a new android body, massacred the human Zodiac, and took over their criminal operations.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2 #26 (November 1987)</ref>
{{-}}

===Aquarius (LMD)===
An android Aquarius was a [[Life Model Decoy]] created by [[Scorpio (Marvel Comics)|Scorpio (Jacob Fury)]] to be part of his Zodiac crime organization. Scorpio went after his brother, [[Nick Fury]], with his new group, but was defeated by [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] and [[Moon Knight]].<ref>''The Defenders'' #48-50</ref> The Zodiac LMD's were recruited by [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] during his bout with temporary insanity, and Quicksilver ordered the Zodiac LMD's to destroy [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] for their imagined wrongdoings. The Avengers managed to defeat the group and most were remanded into federal custody.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2 Annual #1</ref>

The android Zodiac were soon released, and the Scorpio LMD rebuilt a number of them. Scorpio used the Zodiac Key to create LMDs that exemplified the forces and personalities inherent in each sign, hoping to create great strength in the combination of all twelve traits of the Zodiac. He arranged the ambush in which the android Zodiac killed all of the remaining human Zodiac leaders except Cornelius van Lunt, alias [[Taurus (comics)|Taurus]]. It was later revealed the Libra had also survived the attack on the original Zodiac Cartel. Immediately afterward, Van Lunt sought out the services of the Avengers' West Coast branch to confront and defeat the android Zodiac. He was destroyed by Hawkeye in a battle with the [[West Coast Avengers]].<ref name="ReferenceA">''West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2 #26-28</ref>

The Zodiac Key immediately resurrected the Scorpio LMD. Claiming superiority and believing that the Zodiac would eventually kill the Avengers as the androids could never be stopped, Scorpio wanted to use the Key to transport everyone on the scene to the Key's native dimension where the conflict, he believed, could be prolonged indefinitely. However, when the androids were in the other dimension, they ceased to function because each of them were aligned with a particular zodiacal energy, energy that did not exist in the other dimension. The Avengers found [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] and [[Tigra]] had been sent to the same dimension and, reunited, the team was sent back to Earth by the Brotherhood. However, secretly the Brotherhood waited so that someday they could also send the Key to Earth again and create new conflicts for them.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Aquarius (Ecliptic)===
Aquarius was a later addition to the Zodiac. A man of few words, he tended to remain in the background despite his power. He was killed with the rest of the Zodiac by [[Weapon X]].

===Thanos' Aquarius===
The fifth Aquarius is an unnamed male that [[Thanos]] recruited to join his incarnation of the Zodiac.<ref>''Avengers Assemble'' vol. 2 #1</ref> He and the other Zodiac members perish when Thanos abandons them on the self-destructing Helicarrier where [[John King (comics)|Cancer]] was the only survivor.<ref>''Avengers Assemble'' vol. 2 #4</ref>

===Aquarius in other media===
A variation of Aquarius appears in ''[[Marvel Anime: Iron Man]]''. This version is a mech utilized by Zodiac. It attaches itself to a [[Japan Self-Defense Forces|JSDF]] satellite to project a radiation beam from its solar panels down into Iron Man's Arc Station and irradiate most of the surrounding area, causing a sickness that attacks white blood cells around Tokyo. Using Dr. Chika Tanaka's prototype booster technology and a ride from Captain Nagato Sakurai, Iron Man reaches the satellite and destroys the Aquarius mech.

== Arakko ==
Expressively female, Arakko is a sentient island, created several thousands years prior to the Modern Age in the South Pacific alongside its twin male counterpart, Krakoa, when the island's true form, Okkara, was attacked by an enemy from another dimension, that wielding a twilight sword split it into the two single islands which created a rift into the invading dimension. A great number of mutants, among them Apocalypse and his family, were living in Okkara when it was attacked. With his children forming the First Horsemen, Apocalypse and his wife Genesis were successful in pushing back the enemy's armies but to seal the rift, Genesis decided to make the ultimate sacrifice and lead the First Horsemen and the entire mutant population along with Arakko to the other side of the breach, to shut it and deny the enemy's forces access to Earth, while Apocalypse remained on Earth to become stronger.<ref>''Powers of X'' #4</ref>

Arakko and its mutant population ended up on the dimension of Amenth, a dimension filled with various Daemons and ruled by the  dark god Annihilation, a mystical being that exists as a golden helm and needs a host to interact with the outside world. Once there, one tenth of the Arakki mutants fled into the wasteland, overwhelmed by the demonic nature of Amenth. Some of the mutants were later captured by the forces of Annihilation and forced to breed with Daemons to create a new warrior sub-race, the Summoners. The mutant alchemists and wizards combined their powers to create ten towers which would protect them from the Daemons' threat. As thousands of years passed, the mutants kept warring with the enemies in a seemingly never endless war. Eventually Genesis, gathered an army and went out of Arakko into a years old journey to end the enemies' threat for good, but she and what left of the army returned after a disastrous encounter with fellow mutant and former ally White Sword.<ref>''X of Swords: Stasis'' #1</ref> Then after Genesis' own sister, Isca the Unbeaten, also defected to the Amenthi, and told Genesis that Annihilation, challenged her to a fight for victory, Genesis accepted the challenge, but apparently lost. This left the Daemon armies to destroy Arakko's towers and finally set the island on fire.<ref>''X of Swords: Creation'' #1</ref> As countless mutants kept being slaughtered by the enemies, the last survivors send the Summoner, son of the Horseman of War, to go find his grandfather for him and Krakoa to help them defeat the enemies. However the truth was that Genesis had actually won but refused to put on the helm and therefore becoming Annihilation's new host. Without a proper leader, the Daemons were left without a leash and attacked Arakko in full strength as Genesis was kept a prisoner until she saw Summoner and a piece of Arakko being sent to Earth as a plea for help. Genesis felt that her people had lost their way, and finally succumbed to Amenth's will. Now, their two forces were one.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 5 #14</ref>

The small piece of Arakko that Summoner was sent to, appeared off the southern coast of Krakoa. Cyclops along with his children, Cable and Prestige explored the new landmass before the two islands merged into one.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 5 #2</ref> When the Summoner returned to assemble their Swordbearers, which included Redroot, Arakko's translator, the Summoner informed Arakko that sadly it would not be joined with its other anytime soon. However, following the war between Amenth and Krakoa, as prize for his victory, Omniversal Majestrix Saturnyne exchanged Apocalypse with Arakko, returning the island and its mutant population back to Earth.<ref>''X of Swords: Destruction'' #1</ref>

After finally returning to Earth, Arakko tried to reunite with Krakoa, but time had changed both of them, even speaking two totally different languages and apparently didn't love each other anymore, so they both decided to stay separate.

===Planet Arakko===
During the first annual Hellfire Gala and realizing the difficulties in accommodating a massive population of warlike mutants on Earth, Magneto proposed a plan to terraform Mars and re-locate Arakko and its inhabitants there in a power play that claim the red planet as the capital of the solar system and the first mutant world. The Great Ring consented to the plan and lent their aid. After the planet was made hospitable for life during the Hellfire Gala, Exodus, with the aid of Jean Grey and Lactuca the Knower, uprooted the island and sent it to Mars.
 
Storm helps create a new landmark on the planet, the Lake Hellias Diplomatic Ring, intended to serve as the ultimate place for peace to be spoken of and achieved in the Solar System. Xilo even uses his powers to create statues of Apocalypse and Genesis within a massive valley, with the promise of only peace can existe in this sacred space. Jamie Braddock then uses his powers to literally give birth to a second space station for S.W.O.R.D. ready to defend Arakko against any invaders or enemies. As one final touch, Jamie even creates Port Prometheus, a docking station for all visitors to come to. Storm and Magneto then plant a Krakoa Gate, which will allow the X-Men and their allies from Krakoa to visit Mars, now redubbed Planet Arakko and proclaimed to be the new capital of the Sol System.<ref>''Planet-Size X-Men''#1</ref>

Being recruited by the [[Gestapo]] he was used as a Nazi-henchman in several Marvel comic stories set in [[World War II]]. He was originally an enemy of the Golden Age [[Angel (Thomas Halloway)|Angel]] but also had run-ins with [[Captain America]] as well as the WW II-era [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]].

A suicidal girl from San Francisco, Violet Lightner's attempt at killing herself failed when she bonded with the alien superweapon known as the Tactigon, an empathic weapon capable of anticipating the needs of its host.

== Aron ==
'''Aron the Rogue [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]]''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is the nephew of [[Uatu]]. Aron first appeared in ''[[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]]'' #39 and was created by [[Steve Englehart]] and [[Al Milgrom]].<ref name="The Marvel Encyclopedia">{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=29}}</ref>

Aron originally dwelt upon the [[Watcher (comics)|Watchers]]' homeworld with the other members of his race. He observed [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Mar-Vell]] and [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] battling [[Mad-Eye]], and then attended the trial of [[Uatu]].<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #39</ref> Aron was seen alongside Uatu again later.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' Annual #21</ref>

Aron decided to forsake the Watchers' oath and actively participate in events on Earth, becoming an instigator and manipulator.  He set [[Dragon Man (comics)|Dragon Man]] against [[She-Hulk]] and [[Sharon Ventura|She-Thing]], and obtained cell samples from the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and She-Thing.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #321</ref> Aron observed the [[Fantastic Four]] battling [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]], and witnessed the events of [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #322</ref> Aron was in turn observed by Necrodamus.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #323</ref> Aron then joined forces with the [[Frightful Four]] against the Fantastic Four,<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #327</ref> but soon quit the Frightful Four. Aron created clones of the Fantastic Four and She-Thing, and imprisoned the real Fantastic Four and Frightful Four members in suspended animation, and watched their dreams.  He replaced the real Fantastic Four with his clones, and set them against the [[Mole Man]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #328-329</ref> Aron continued to engineer "adventures" for his clones, causing them to appear as criminals. The clones battled the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Doctor Strange]], and were ultimately defeated by the real Fantastic Four after the originals broke free. Aron settled for watching the dreams of the clones instead.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #330-333</ref>

When the entire species of the Watchers faced extinction at the hands of the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]], Aron planned to plunge either Earth's solar system or its galaxy (the narration is not entirely clear) into a [[pocket universe]], which he intended to live on in. He even collaborated with Dark Raider (the Mister Fantastic of Earth-944) to further his goals. However, his plan was thwarted by the expanded Fantastic Four and their allies, and Aron was reduced to energy by his uncle Uatu. For this action, Uatu was stripped of his position as a Watcher. Uatu believed that Aron's energies would serve as the core around which to create a new "One", the sentient repository of all the Watchers' knowledge, whose predecessor had been destroyed by the Celestial [[Exitar the Exterminator]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #396-400</ref>

As a member of the Watchers, the level of Aron's physical and mental abilities are unknown, and potentially incalculable by human standards. He has the ability to manipulate cosmic energy for various effects, including the ability to convert his body into energy for travel through hyperspace, and projection of cosmic energy as concussive force, molecular manipulation of matter, inter-dimensional teleportation, creation of force fields, levitation, size transformations, alteration of his physical appearance, and enhancement of his physical attributes. He possesses virtual immortality, bolstered by treatment with "delta-rays" (though Watchers can die by losing the will to live).

He has also developed his vast psionic powers through training, and his powers include telepathy, illusion-casting, and energy-manipulation powers.

Aron has access to various alien artifacts and technology as needed. Through unknown means, Aron created a special armor that shields him from detection by his fellow Watchers.

'''Astra''' is a member of the [[Shi'ar]] Imperium's [[Imperial Guard (Marvel Comics)|Imperial Guard]]. The character, created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Dave Cockrum]], first appeared in ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #107. Astra has the ability to become intangible, allowing her to pass through solid objects. She can also use her power offensively, phasing her hand into her opponent and becoming partly solid, which gives them a physical shock and renders them unconscious. Like many original members of the Imperial Guard, Astra is the analog of a character from [[DC Comics]]' [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]: in her case [[Phantom Girl]].<ref name=CBR>Cronin, Brian.

Astra takes part in the "[[Operation: Galactic Storm]]" crossover event, which ran through [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]-related titles in 1992.

'''Atum''' (also known as '''Demogorge''') is a being in the [[Marvel Universe]], named after the Egyptian god [[Atum]]. The character, created by Alan Zelenetz, first appeared in ''Thor'' Annual'' #10 in 1982.

Within the context of the stories, Atum is the son of the entity known as the Demiurge and the Elder God Gaea. A golden humanoid imbued with the power of the Sun itself, Atum kills the warring Elder Gods and, absorbing their life force, is changed by their evil energies and devolves into a huge, hulking demonic being ‚Äì Demogorge, the God Eater. Only Chthon and [[Father Set|Set]] survive by fleeing into alternate dimensions. With Gaea the only Elder God remaining, the God Eater sheds the Elder Gods' energies and becomes Atum, journeying to the Sun and hibernating there.<ref>''Seen in flashback in'' ''Thor'' Annual #10 (1982)</ref> During this long period of hibernation, Atum takes on the identity of Ammon-Ra, and forms the [[Heliopolitans (comics)|Ogdoad]], the primordial gods of ancient Egypt.<ref>''Thor/Hercules: Encyclopedia Mythologica'' (2009)</ref>

Thousands of years later, a group of eight Death Gods from various pantheons combine their mystical might to join all the Hells into one vast dimension. This act forces the reemergence and intervention of the Demogorge, who consumed all but the fleeing Hela. A champion from each pantheon is sent to stop Demogorge and prevent further disaster. Led by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], the champions find the God Eater and battle it. Demogorge is defeated by Thor, who plunges into one of its orifices and attacks the God Eater's inner workings. Damaged beyond repair, the entity can no longer contain the energies it has consumed and releases all the previously consumed gods, and restores the Hells to their rightful dimensions.<ref>''Thor'' Annual #10 (1982)</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, the alien [[Skrulls]] invade Earth at the behest of their deities, ''Kly'bn'' and ''Sl'gur't''. A [[God Squad (comics)|cadre of gods]] consisting of [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], [[Snowbird (comics)|Snowbird]], [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]] and [[Ajak]] is formed to combat the Skrull gods, with Atum joining the Earthly pantheon at the request of [[Horus (Marvel Comics)|Horus]]. He compares himself to a shepherd defending his flock, which he will one day eat.<ref>''The Incredible Hercules'' #117 (May 2008)</ref> During the confrontation, Atum is killed after trying to devour Sl'gur't, who tears him apart from the inside.<ref>''The Incredible Hercules'' #120 (August 2008)</ref>

Later, after Thor is slain battling the evil Serpent,<ref>''Fear Itself'' #7</ref> his divine soul travels to an afterlife for gods, where he joins many other deities who appear to have died and are all on their way to be devoured by Demogorge; apparently a being such as he can never truly be destroyed.<ref>''The Mighty Thor'' vol. 4 #8</ref> Nevertheless, Thor defeats him by smashing his heart after entering his body, and escapes him once again.

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=March 2015}}
The Collector first appeared in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #28 (May 1966), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Don Heck]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=91}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Taneleer Tivan is one of the [[Elders of the Universe]] and is close to his fellow Elder En Dwi Gast (the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]). He apparently came to self-awareness billions of years ago, on the planet Cygnus X-1. He is an enormously powerful being who wielded the [[Power Primordial]] and, though at first he took the appearance of an old human, his true form is a powerful alien.{{issue|date=January 2015}}

For millions of years, the Collector lived on an unknown world with his wife and child, spending his days in thought and contemplation. Over three billion years ago, when his wife, Matani Tivan, lost the will to live and relinquished her immortality, the Collector realized he would need a hobby to maintain his own sanity, and began collecting interesting artifacts and life forms from around the universe. Eventually, his obsession reached such heights he collected anything he considered rare or valuable often just for the sake of collecting. As such, he has a wide variety of rare or unique items at his disposal.{{issue|date=January 2015}}

The Collector also had the power of prophecy, allowing him to foresee the rise of a being powerful enough to pose a threat to the Elders: [[Thanos]]. To protect life in the universe, the Collector created a massive museum of countless life forms to keep them safe from Thanos. For a time, he even possessed one of the six [[Infinity Gems]], unaware of its true power, until Thanos took it.{{issue|date=January 2015}}

At some point over his billions of years of life he came into contact with other beings who, like him, are the sole survivors of the first species in the universe.  He often refers to these fellow elders as brothers though they usually only work together if they have a common goal.{{issue|date=January 2015}}

In the modern era, the Collector eventually traveled to Earth. He captured the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] and sought to "collect" the other [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] with help from the [[Abner Jenkins|Beetle]], but was defeated by them.<ref>''The Avengers'' #28. [[Marvel Comics]]. Marvel Comics.</ref> He later enslaved [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], then captured the Wasp and the other Avengers. He restored [[Henry Pym|Goliath]]'s size-change powers, but was then defeated by the Avengers again.<ref>''The Avengers'' #51. Marvel Comics</ref> He next compelled [[Iron Man]] to serve as his pawn against the warrior Val-Larr.<ref>''Iron Man'' #26. Marvel Comics.</ref> He attempted to "collect" the Avengers once more, in Rutland, Vermont.<ref>''The Avengers'' #119. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In ''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 issues #197 ("...And Man-Thing makes three!") and #198 ("The Shangri-La syndrome!"), the Collector uses the previously captured [[Man-Thing]] and the [[Glob (comics)|Glob]] to capture the Hulk. After capturing the Hulk, the Collector muses on capturing the rest of the original Avengers. The Hulk escapes freeing several of the Collectors exhibits. The newly free exhibits die from old age because they are no longer artificially preserved by the power of the Collector's ship. Man-Thing also escapes disappearing into the Swamp. The Glob remains aboard the ship and though it is not shown, it is suggested that the Glob kills the Collector. The lines from the comic book are "What the Glob wants here is quite simple: He wants the Collectors life! The Collector's anguished scream fades long before it can filter through the museum-ships long corridors. For several seconds silence reigns both within the ship and without--"<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #197-198. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===The Korvac Saga===
In the 1978 storyline "[[The Korvac Saga]]", after Thanos was defeated by Earth's superheroes, the Collector foresees another major threat: [[Korvac]] the Machine Man, a cyborg monstrosity from the 31st century of a divergent timeline, taking the form of a man named Michael in 20th century New York. The Avengers were also aware of a new threat but did not know his identity. In an attempt to protect them, the Collector added some of them to his collection and was probably planning to enlist their aid, when a second group of Avengers appeared and defeated him in combat.<ref>''The Avengers'' #174. Marvel Comics.</ref> After the defeat, the Collector remained in seclusion until a human named Peter Tran of Avondale summoned him to Earth.{{issue|date=January 2014}}

Sensing that his end was at hand, the Collector revealed that having learned of Korvac, he had made his own daughter [[Carina (comics)|Carina]] into a spy and living weapon to use against the Machine Man, imbuing her with the [[Power Primordial]]. Just as he was about to tell the heroes who their enemy was, Michael learned of his duplicity and used his cosmic powers to blast the Collector into atoms, proving the prediction of the aged scholar's own end to be correct.<ref>''The Avengers'' #172-174. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===1980s===
In the 1982 miniseries ''[[Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions]]'', the Elder known as the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] plays a game called the [[Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions|Contest of Champions]] with [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]], which resulted in Death resurrecting his fellow Elder the Collector.<ref>[[Grant, Steven]]; [[Gruenwald, Mark]]; [[Mantlo, Bill]] (w), [[Romita, John Jr.]] (p), [[Marcos, Pablo]] (i), "Chapter 3: Third Contest: Siege in the City of the Dead!", ''[[Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions]]'' #3 (Aug. 1982). Marvel Comics</ref> The Collector captured [[Marrina Smallwood|Marrina]], then battled [[Alpha Flight]] and [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up Annual'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> He aided the Grandmaster by tricking the Avengers into entering Death's realm.<ref>''The West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2 Annual #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===1990s===
The Collector assisted his fellow elders in a plot to kill [[Galactus]] and recreate the universe, but he was thwarted by the [[Silver Surfer]] and consumed by Galactus.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #3-4, 7, 9, 10. Marvel Comics.</ref> Since Death had vowed that the Elders could no longer die, they caused Galactus to have "cosmic indigestion" until they were forced out of him by [[Master Order]] and [[Lord Chaos (Marvel Comics)|Lord Chaos]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #17. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Collector was one of the four Elders who aided the Silver Surfer and Nova in helping Galactus to defeat the In-Betweener.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #18. Marvel Comics.</ref> Once the battle was over the five Elders used their Infinity Gems to instantaneously travel very far away from Galactus and his vengeance.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #19. Marvel Comics.</ref> He later gave his Infinity Gem to Thanos in exchange for the [[Runner (comics)|Runner]], who Thanos had recently captured and de-aged. Once released from Thanos's prison, the Runner returned to his true age and began to beat the Collector up for daring to try to imprison him.<ref>''Thanos Quest'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Collector re-appeared when the Avengers fought Thane Ector and the Brethren, who were noted to have escaped from the Collector's collection. It was then noted later that the Collector had planned all of this, intending the Brethren to lay waste to the Earth so that he could "collect" the surviving humans. It was at this point he showed his true form to the Avengers and was noted to be very powerful; enough to subdue Thane Ector. The Collector was eventually thwarted by the Avengers, and the Brethren's [[Uni-Mind]].<ref>''The Avengers'' #334-339. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Collector uses the Collection Agency and the Silver Surfer as pawns to capture a virus that caused insanity.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #58-61, 64. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===2000s===
In a 2007 story, the Collector becomes involved with Galactus once again when the latter entity wished to devour one of the worlds that held many of the entities the Collector had taken. Among them were the [[Starjammers]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].<ref>''Wolverine'' #135. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In a 2009 story, the Grandmaster makes a bet with the Collector who sets his team of Defenders ([[Hulk]], [[Doctor Strange]], [[Namor]], and the [[Silver Surfer]]) against the Grandmaster's team of Offenders (which comprises the [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]], [[Baron Mordo]], [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]], and [[Terrax]]).<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2 #10 (2009). Marvel Comics.</ref> The game results in Hulk claiming victory and the Collector complies with the terms of the game, giving the Hulk the lifeless body of Jarella.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2 #12 (July 2009). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===2010s===
Eight months after the events of the 2015 storyline "[[Secret Wars (2015)|Secret Wars]]", the Collector is shown in charge of Battlerealm, the small surviving portion of [[Battleworld]]. He engages in a new [[Contest of Champions (2015 comics)|Contest of Champions]] with the Grandmaster, with the prize being an ancient cosmic artifact called the Iso-Sphere.<ref>''Contest of Champions'' #1-2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In a 2017 story, when the hammer of the [[Thor (Ultimate Marvel character)|Earth-1610 Thor]] falls to Asgard after, and the Collector finds that he cannot lift it, he takes all of the abandoned Asgard into his possession. When Thor searches for the hammer, the Collector takes him prisoner, threatening to kill other aliens in his collection unless Thor tells him the secret of how to bypass the worthiness enchantment.<ref>''The Unworthy Thor'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> He then encounters Proxima Midnight and [[Black Swan (comics)|Black Swan]], who were sent by [[Thanos]] to retrieve the hammer. After Odinson, [[Beta Ray Bill]], Odinson's pet goat Toothgnasher and the Helhound [[Thori (comics)|Thori]] escape and battle his army, the Collector tries to recapture Odinson, only for him to break free and grab the hammer.<ref>''The Unworthy Thor'' #3-4. Marvel Comics.</ref> Odinson chooses not to claim the hammer, but he and Bill are able to channel its power to return Asgard to its true place, simultaneously decimating the Collector's forces, prompting him to kill his last soldier so that he can have the pleasure of destroying something unique.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Jason Aaron]]|artist=[[Coipel, Olivier]]; [[Jacinto, Kim]]; [[Alixe, Pascal]]|title=[[The Unworthy Thor]]|storyThe Whisper|issue=5|date=May 2017|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Collector possesses the ability to manipulate cosmic energy for a variety of effects, including projecting concussive force beams, and the increasing of his size and mass (and hence physical strength) at will. He also possesses limited shape-changing abilities. His precognitive abilities give him brief visions of alternate future, although he must meditate for long periods to identify the individuals he sees in the vision and its apparent point in time. He has telepathic abilities that enable him to make limited contact with the minds of other Elders. Due to a vow by [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]], the Collector and all the Elders cannot die and are effectively immortal.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The Collector has a vast knowledge and comprehension of the advanced science and technology of numerous alien worlds, as well as a collection of devices and artifacts from those worlds. His armored battle-suit is made of the alien metal etherion, which amplifies the wearer's strength to superhuman levels, and it has jets that permit flight. He uses various weapons from many time periods and different worlds. Among his arsenal from Earth's past are catapults, Tibetan crystal balls that emit mystical rays, and magic beans that can conjure up warrior giants. He possesses a magic lamp that can summon a four-headed djinn with mystical powers. His "boxes" are rectangular "interdimensional traps" that can weaken a victim's strength or sanity. Other weapons include gigantic robot guards, a stun beam, and stasis beams. The Collector also has zoos of alien beasts which he can release to attack his adversaries. Among this is Snake-Eyes, an enormous alien serpent with hypnotic powers. Other items in his collection include the Obedience Potion, with which the Collector can compel a human victim to do his bidding; the Cosmic Viewer, with which he can monitor events on various worlds; a [[Kymellian]] translation/control device resembling a flute, with which he can communicate with other living beings; and a time probe enabling him to find and procure artifacts from other time periods. He uses starships holding museums of his collections, a Temporal Assimilator that allows time travel, Persian "flying carpets" and a "flying cape" that allowed flight. He formerly possessed the [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Gem]] that could control reality, but he did not understand its power.<ref>''[[The Thanos Quest]]'' #2 (Nov. 1990). Marvel Comics.</ref>

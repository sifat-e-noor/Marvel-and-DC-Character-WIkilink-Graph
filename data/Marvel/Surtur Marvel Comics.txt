==Fictional character biography==
Surtur is a fire giant native to the extradimensional plane of [[Muspelheim]], land of the fire demons and one of the nine worlds in Norse mythology. He first appears in the title ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'', where it is claimed he sits at the end of the world waiting for the end of time where he can slay men and gods.<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #97 (Oct. 1963). Marvel Comics.</ref> The character's first encounter with the Asgardian ruler [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] is told in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] and  establishes their [[enmity]] when Surtur is imprisoned by Odin inside the Earth after forming an alliance with the Trolls and trying to destroy the world in anger for Odin defying him, although he gives Odin a winged horse, hoping to be released one day.<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #99 (Dec. 1963). Marvel Comics.</ref> Surtur reappears in ''Journey into Mystery'' #104, having been freed by Odin's adopted son, [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]], who intends to usurp Odin and rule Asgard, having been given a portion of the Odinforce. Together with the Storm Giant Skagg, the character invades Earth, although the pair are met by Odin, his son the Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and fellow Asgardian [[Balder (comics)|Balder]]. Odin stops time and sends every human on Earth to another dimension. Surtur creates a blazing fireball and travels to the [[North Pole]] to melt the icecaps. Using Odin's sword, Thor stops Surtur and traps him on a meteorite of magnetic particles in another galaxy.<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #104 (May 1964). Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the title ''Thor'' the seer [[Volla (Marvel Comics)|Volla]] predicts that Loki will free Surtur and other enemies of Asgard and eventually bring about [[Ragnarok]] – a war that will end with the destruction of all the Norse Gods.<ref>''Thor'' #128 (May 1966). Marvel Comics.</ref> The character features in the title ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' when summoned – together with ice giant [[Ymir (Marvel Comics)|Ymir]] – to Earth by the cult the [[Sons of Satannish]]. The entities are banished by the combined efforts of the superhero team the Avengers, the hero the [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]], and the sorcerer [[Doctor Strange]]. They are tricked into striking each other, which defeats them both.<ref>''The Avengers'' #61 (Feb. 1969). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Surtur becomes a recurring foe in the title ''Thor'', and first attempts to invade Asgard during the Odinsleep when Loki has briefly taken control, causing Loki to flee Asgard, but he is repelled and imprisoned.<ref>''Thor'' #176-177 (May–June 1970). Marvel Comics.</ref> Surtur reappears wielding the huge magical blade Twilight, and after sending a horde of demons to invade Earth storms Asgard. The heroes of Earth battle the fire demons while in Asgard Surtur defeats both Thor and Odin in turn. Loki deceives Surtur with an illusion until Odin recovers, who battles the fire demon until both fall into a dimensional rift.<ref>''Thor'' #337-338 (Nov.-Dec. 1983); #341-348 (Mar.-Oct. 1984); #351-353 (Jan.-Mar. 1985). Marvel Comics.</ref> After a long absence Odin returns to Asgard, and it is revealed that he absorbed Surtur's essence, which eventually possesses him. Surtur manages to recreate his physical form and decimates Asgard until Thor, wielding the Odin Power, banishes Surtur to the Sea of Eternal Night.<ref>''Thor'' #399-400 (Jan-Feb. 1989); #418 (Jun. 1990) & #425 (Oct. 1990). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Surtur appears at the conclusion of the second volume of ''Thor'' during the final [[Ragnarok]] of Asgard, and is allowed to storm Asgard by Thor as the Thunder God attempts to break the endless cycle of death and rebirth for the Norse Gods.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2 #85 (Dec. 1984). Marvel Comics.</ref> In the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill'', the alien [[Beta Ray Bill]] visits the ruins of Asgard after the battle, and sees Surtur's dead form falling from the sky, still clutching Twilight.<ref>''Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill'' #1-6 (Mar.-Aug. 2005). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Thor returns from a period of self-induced [[hibernation]] in a third self-titled volume, and enters the Odinsleep to find Odin in a [[limbo]] dimension between life and death, where Surtur stored a portion of his essence to prevent himself from being killed forever. Here Odin and the demon battle to the death, being reborn each day to repeat the cycle, preventing either from being reborn. Thor helps Odin beat Surtur twice, even though he will be reborn, before returning to his body. Thor offers to help Odin escape from this realm and the constant battle with Surtur. Odin chooses to remain in order to protect his people from the demon.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 3 #7-8 (Mar.-April 2008). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Surtur was resurrected and made a deal with Loki and a group of beings known as the Manchester Gods, who he manipulated to depose the native gods of the British isles.<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #641. Marvel Comics.</ref> He then set the world tree Yggdrasil on fire and attempted to turn the Vanir gods against the Aesir in preparation for his assault on Asgard.<ref>''The Mighty Thor'' #19. Marvel Comics.</ref> This succeeded because of old grudges, namely Odin's insistence that the people of [[Vanaheim]] fall under his rule no matter what.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Powers and abilities==
Surtur was depicted as an immense and malevolent elemental fire demon whose power was of apocalyptic proportions. Standing over 1,000&nbsp;ft. in height, Surtur possessed strength and durability far surpassing that of Thor; the ability to generate intense heat, flames or concussive force; molecular manipulation such as transforming his fingers into serpents;<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #99</ref> levitation and inter-dimensional travel. Surtur's scale of power is usually shown to equal that of Odin. He is a skilled warrior and swordsman, and has a prehensile tail. He possesses a great intellect, and has vast knowledge of ancient and arcane wisdom. He is vulnerable to intense cold, and can be imprisoned by certain magical spells or by other beings wielding cosmic energy powers equaling his own.

Surtur possesses the giant sword Twilight, also known as the Sword of Doom, composed of a metal known as Scabrite which can only be found in the mines of Surtur's realm. The sword is magical, capable of manipulating vast amounts of mystical energy, and can be used to perform feats such as shattering dimensional barriers and inhibiting Odin's powers. Loki has temporarily tapped into the power of the sword to change Thor into a frog (Thor is normally resistant to this type of magical transformation) and making the Asgardian populace sick ([[Asgardians (Marvel Universe)|Asgardians]] are normally immune to disease). [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan Le Fay]] tapped into the power of the sword to reshape the entire planet Earth from modern day into a medieval world after using the chaos magic of the Scarlet Witch to "bridge the gap" between her personal faerie powers and the Asgardian magics bound to the blade. When the sword is bonded with the Eternal Flame, its powers are further increased to an unknown level.

The Eternal Flame has an unknown connection to Surtur. When in its vicinity, Surtur claimed it increased his powers. It is unknown to what extent this power increase leads to.

==Other versions==
Surtur appears in an [[Amalgam Comics]] [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] publication ''Thorion of the New Gods'', in which he assaults Asgard during [[Ragnarök]], but is stopped and imprisoned by the [[DC Comics]] [[Source (comics)|Source]] on the Ego-Mass—an amalgamation of [[Ego the Living Planet|Ego]] and the [[Source Wall]].<ref>''Thorion of the New Asgods'' (June 1997). Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] reality, Surtur is seen summoned to Earth by Loki and battling the [[Ultimates]]. However, he is not seen in the final battle with the Ultimates.<ref>''Ultimates'' vol. 2 #13 (May 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the series ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'', Surtur is part of [[Krona (comics)|Krona]]'s army, and attacks [[Wonder Woman]] near the end of the issue after she vows to guard a pass so the other heroes can get through, although [[She-Hulk]] stays to help her.<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

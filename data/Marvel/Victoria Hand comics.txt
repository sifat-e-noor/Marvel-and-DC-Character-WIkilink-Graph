Hand appeared as a supporting character throughout the 2010-2013 ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' series from issue #1 (Aug. 2010) through the character's death in issue #32 (Dec. 2012).

==Fictional character biography==
Hand was initially introduced as a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] accountant, dating a fellow agent named [[Isabelle (Marvel Comics)|Isabelle]] - a partner with different beliefs about the fight against criminals and terrorists. Three years before the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, Victoria sent a letter to S.H.I.E.L.D. director [[Nick Fury]] about his war on terrorism and her concerns that he was doing a poor job. Isabelle implored Victoria not to send the letter. The result was Hand's transferral to a S.H.I.E.L.D. Base in Portland, Oregon. Hand's relationship broke down due to Isabelle's anger over her advice being ignored.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" storyline, [[Norman Osborn]] was promoted from director of Thunderbolt Initiative to the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. upon which he dismantled it and transformed it into the operation known as [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] He appointed Victoria to the position of Deputy Director of this organization due to her vocal opposition of previous S.H.I.E.L.D. directors Nick Fury and [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]. She willingly supported Osborn's agenda to subvert the heroes and place villains instead, believing that Osborn would bring peace to the world. Victoria also has a certain level of authority over Norman's Avengers despite the fact Norman gave Moonstone the position of his second-in-command.<ref>''The Mighty Avengers'' #20. Marvel Comics.</ref> She was also given the task of finding an acronym for H.A.M.M.E.R.<ref>''The Invincible Iron Man'' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Norman Osborn received word from Victoria Hand that they have apprehended [[Maria Hill]].<ref>''The Invincible Iron Man'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Victoria was sent with [[Karla Sofen|Moonstone]] to neutralize Bruce Banner (AKA the [[Hulk]]), Osborn reasoning that Banner's intellect is a greater threat than the Hulk's brute strength. She and Moonstone engaged a powerless Bruce Banner and [[Skaar (character)|Skaar]]. H.A.M.M.E.R. gave the duo the means to restore Banner's gamma powers, something Skaar was waiting for (as he had sworn to kill his true "father"). With Banner coated in gamma radiation the duo left, their mission accomplished.<ref>''Dark Reign-The List: Hulk'' one-shot. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Victoria was part of the attack that went after the [[Asgardians (Marvel Universe)|Asgardians]], where she was leading the helicarrier squad.<ref>''Siege'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the attack, the ship she was on was heavily damaged and Victoria ordered the evacuation of the crew. When the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)#Void|Void]] took full control of Robert Reynolds' body, Iron Man informed her to leave the ship as he intended to use the Helicarrier as a giant bullet. After the battle, Victoria didn't resist arrest and was taken on to a Helicarrier, where she was interviewed by [[Captain America|Captain Steve Rogers]]. Victoria said that she didn't regret anything and that she was trying to help the world. In response, Steve gave her a position in his new team, which surprised Victoria.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #16. Marvel Comics.</ref>

It was later revealed that she had been assigned by Captain Steve Rogers to be the liaison for [[Luke Cage]]'s team of Avengers, dubbed the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]], because Rogers feels that she can provide an important insight to the team.<ref name="NewAvengersv2n1">''The New Avengers'' vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Spider-Man]] in particular does not trust her due to her old contact with Osborn, to the extent that he refuses to reveal his secret identity to her even when it means that he will not get paid for his work on the team.<ref>''The New Avengers'' vol. 2 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> Luke's wife [[Jessica Jones]] also does not trust Hand, mainly because Hand nervously pointed a cannon at her and their infant daughter when they met in the Avengers mansion.<ref name="NewAvengersv2n1"/> Hand was contacted by the remnants of H.A.M.M.E.R. to ask her to join them; instead, she provided the meeting location to the New Avengers so that they could sabotage the meeting. The subsequent assault resulted in the potentially fatal injury of [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]].<ref>''The New Avengers'' vol. 2 #11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During a later confrontation with [[Superia]] (head of this branch of H.A.M.M.E.R.), Hand claimed that her betrayal of H.A.M.M.E.R. was actually a ruse intended to convince Steve Rogers that her allegiance is with him after H.A.M.M.E.R. contacted her on a public line rather than through more secret channels.<ref>''The New Avengers'' vol. 2 #12. Marvel Comics.</ref> She then provided the New Avengers with the location from which the H.A.M.M.E.R. agents were going to be recovered, allowing the Avengers to capture Superia and use an experimental serum she was trying to steal to treat Mockingbird.<ref>''The New Avengers'' vol. 2 #13. Marvel Comics.</ref> Spider-Man's suspicions of Hand eventually prompted him to leave the New Avengers (although this was due in part to his new responsibilities in the [[Future Foundation]]), informing the rest of the team that she would eventually turn on them due to her old ties to Norman Osborn. Spider-Man eventually returned to the team.<ref>''The New Avengers'' vol. 2 #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After Osborn's second incarnation of the Dark Avengers launched their attack,<ref>''The New Avengers'' vol. 2 #19. Marvel Comics.</ref> Hand revealed to the New Avengers that she was actually a triple agent, pretending to work for Captain America while pretending to work for Norman Osborn while ''really'' working for Captain America, subsequently helping the New Avengers set a trap for Osborn to try and rescue the captured Captain America after [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]'s heightened senses confirmed that she was telling the truth.<ref>''The New Avengers'' vol. 2 #22. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Victoria is possessed by [[Daniel Drumm]]'s ghost during his revenge attack on the New Avengers for what happened to his brother [[Brother Voodoo|Doctor Voodoo]]. Under Daniel Drumm's possession, she was forced to kill [[Daimon Hellstrom]] and [[Jennifer Kale]].<ref>''The New Avengers'' vol. 2 #31. Marvel Comics.</ref> After Doctor Strange dispatched her in the Avengers Mansion and brought her to the Astral Plane, Victoria Hand was killed by Daniel Drumm. After a long battle with two Avengers teams, Drumm is defeated.<ref>''The New Avengers'' vol. 2 #32. Marvel Comics.</ref> A statue of Victoria Hand was erected at the Avengers Mansion. While the group is collected around it, Captain America declared that Hand was "one of us".<ref>''The New Avengers'' vol. 2 #34. Marvel Comics.</ref>

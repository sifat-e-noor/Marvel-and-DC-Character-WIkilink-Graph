The '''X-Corporation''' ('''X-Corp''') is a fictional institution appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], commonly in association with the [[X-Men]] comics. This organization was created to ensure the protection of [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] rights throughout the world due to the increasing number of mutants and widespread [[bigotry]] and [[hate crime]]s against them.

==Fictional history==
X-Corp was founded by [[Professor X|Prof. Charles Xavier]], the founder of the X-Men.<ref>''[[X-Men: Legacy|New X-Men]]'' #128 (Aug. 2002)</ref> Its purpose is to provide support for "civilian" mutant populations on a global scale in a world where the mutant population was outgrowing the reach of the X-Men. X-Corp offices are located in many major cities in every continent, and each office is managed by a former member of the X-Men or one of their satellite teams, such as [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] or [[Domino (comics)|Domino]]. The worldwide headquarters of the X-Corporation is the [[X-Mansion]]. X-Corp works with local governments, such as when they took in the superstrong twelve-year-old orphan [[Molly Hayes]] on behalf of the Social Services of Los Angeles.

It should not be confused with the [[X-Corps]], a short-lived [[paramilitary]] team led by [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], which merged with the X-Corporation after its dissolution, most of its members transferring to the Paris branch.

In the wake of the [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation of mutantkind]], wherein 90-95% of the mutant population was rendered genetically and physically human and thus powerless, several bombings occurred at X-Corporation locales. For the safety of those operating the facilities, and to regroup all empowered members, [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] ordered the evacuation of all X-Corp offices and the organization appears to be dead. With the minimal mutant population and the strict government rules imposed on mutants, the organization would serve no purpose.

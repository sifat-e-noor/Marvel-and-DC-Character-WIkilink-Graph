'''Kull of Atlantis''' or '''Kull the Conqueror''' is a [[fictional character]] created by writer [[Robert E. Howard]]. The character was more introspective than Howard's subsequent creation, [[Conan the Barbarian]], whose first appearance was in a re-write of a rejected Kull story.<ref name="Harvey">{{cite web |last1=Harvey |first1=Ryan |title=Kull, King of the Dreaming West |url=http://perilousworlds.com/kull-king-of-the-dreaming-west/ |website=Perilous Worlds |access-date=23 April 2019 |date=25 February 2019}}</ref><ref name="Black Gate">{{cite web |last1=Byrne |first1=Bob |title=Hither Came Conan: Ruminations on "The Phoenix on the Sword" |url=https://www.blackgate.com/2019/01/22/hither-came-conan-ruminations-on-the-phoenix-on-the-sword/ |website=Black Gate |access-date=23 April 2019 |date=22 January 2019}}</ref>

His first published appearance was "[[The Shadow Kingdom]]" in ''[[Weird Tales]]'' (August, 1929). Kull was portrayed in the 1997 film ''[[Kull the Conqueror]]'' by actor [[Kevin Sorbo]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Life in Atlantis===
Kull was born in pre-cataclysmic [[Atlantis]] [[Upper Paleolithic|c. 100,000 BC]], depicted as inhabited at the time by barbarian tribes. East of Atlantis lay the ancient continent of Thuria, of which the northwest portion is divided among several [[civilization|civilized]] kingdoms. The most powerful among these was Valusia; others included Commoria, Grondar, Kamelia, Thule, and Verulia. Note that the word "Thuria" never appears in any of the Kull stories. Howard coined the term while tying Kull's world to Conan's in the 1936 essay "[[The Hyborian Age]]".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Howard|first1=Robert E.|title=The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian|date=2003|publisher=Del Ray|location=New York|isbn=978-0739440810|pages=381–382|edition=Hardcover}}</ref>

Kull was born into a tribe settled in the Tiger Valley of Atlantis. Both the valley and tribe were destroyed by a flood while Kull was still a toddler, leaving the young Kull to live as a [[feral child]] for many years. Kull was captured by the Sea-Mountain tribe and eventually adopted by them. In "[[Exile of Atlantis]]", an adolescent Kull grants a woman a quick death so that she will not be burned to death by a mob. For this selfless act, Kull is exiled from Atlantis.

===Slave, pirate, outlaw, and gladiator===
Kull attempted to reach Thuria, but was instead captured by Lemurian Pirates. He spent a couple of years as a [[galley slave]] before regaining his freedom during a [[mutiny]].

He tried the life of a [[pirate]] between his late adolescence and his early twenties. His fighting skills and courage allowed him to become [[Captain (nautical)|captain]] of his own ship. Soon, Kull gained a fearsome reputation for himself in the seas surrounding Atlantis and Thuria. Kull lost his ship and crew in a [[naval battle]] off the coast of Valusia, but once again survived. He settled in Valusia as an outlaw. However, his criminal career proved to be short-lived as he was soon captured by the Valusians and imprisoned in a dungeon.  His captors offered him a choice: execution or service as a [[gladiator]]. He chose the latter. After proving to be an effective combatant and gaining fame in the arenas of the capital, a number of fans helped to regain his freedom.

===Soldier and king===
Kull never left Valusia or returned to the life of an outlaw. Instead, he joined the Royal [[army]] as a [[mercenary]], pursuing elevation through the [[military rank|ranks]]. In "The Curse of the Golden Skull" Kull, approaching his thirties, is recruited by King Borna of Valusia in a mission against the ambitious [[Sorcerer (person)|sorcerer]] Rotath of Lemuria. Kull proves to be an effective [[assassination|assassin]].

Borna promoted Kull into the general command of his mercenary forces. Borna himself, however, had gained a reputation for his [[cruelty]] and [[despotism]]. There was discontent with Borna's rule among the [[nobility]], leading eventually to a [[civil war]]. The mercenaries proved more loyal to Kull than any other leader, allowing him to become first the leadership in their revolt and then King. Kull killed Borna and took the throne while he was still in his early thirties. In "[[The Shadow Kingdom]]", Kull has spent six months upon the Valusian throne and faces the first [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] against him.

The series continued with Kull finding that gaining the crown was easier than securing it. He faces several internal and external challenges throughout the series. The conspiring of his [[courtier]]s leaves Kull almost constantly threatened with loss of life and throne. The aging King is ever more aware of the [[Sword of Damocles]] that he inherited along with the crown.

"[[The Mirrors of Tuzun Thune]]" finds Kull reaching his middle forties and becoming progressively more introspective. The former barbarian is left lost in contemplations of [[philosophy]]. At this point, the series ends. His fate is left uncertain. 

In the Conan the Barbarian story "Shadows of the Skull", it is revealed that Conan is a direct descendant of Kull.

==Supporting characters==
Several characters reoccur throughout the series. The best known is his trusted ally Brule the Spear-slayer, a pre-cataclysmic [[Pict]]. First Councillor Tu is a trusted administrator, but also a constant reminder of the tradition bound laws and customs of Valusia.  Ka-Nu (sometimes named Kananu), the Pictish [[Ambassador]] to Valusia and wise man, is responsible for the friendship between Kull and Brule despite the ancient enmity between Atlanteans and Picts.<ref name="BG2">{{cite web |last1=Maynard |first1=William Patrick |title=Kull and the Quest for Identity |url=https://www.blackgate.com/2015/12/04/kull-and-the-quest-for-identity/ |website=Black Gate |access-date=23 April 2019 |date=4 December 2015}}</ref> Kull's mortal enemy is the sorcerer [[Thulsa Doom (character)|Thulsa Doom]].

==Stories==
Only three Kull stories were published before Howard committed suicide in 1936:<ref>[http://www.howardworks.com/subject.htm#kull Howard Works: Kull publication history]</ref>
*"[[The Shadow Kingdom]]" (first published in ''[[Weird Tales]]'', August 1929)
*"[[The Mirrors of Tuzun Thune]]" (first published in ''Weird Tales'', September 1929)
*"Kings of the Night" (first published in ''Weird Tales'', November 1930)

Howard also wrote nine other Kull stories, which were not published until much later:
*"The Altar and the Scorpion" (first published in ''[[Kull (collection)|King Kull]]'', 1967)
*"The Black City" (first published in ''King Kull'', 1967) Also known as "The Black Abyss".
*"[[By This Axe, I Rule]]" (first published in ''King Kull'', 1967) Re-written by Howard into the Conan story "[[The Phoenix on the Sword]]".
*"The Curse of the Golden Skull" (first published in ''The Howard Collector #9'', Spring 1967)
*"Delcardes' Cat" (first published in ''King Kull'', 1967) Also known as "The Cat and the Skull".
*"[[Exile of Atlantis]]" (first published in ''King Kull'', 1967) Originally untitled, title created by [[Glenn Lord]].
*"Riders Beyond the Sunrise" (first published in ''Kull: The Fabulous Warrior King'', 1978 although a version edited by Lin Carter was first published in ''King Kull'', 1967) Originally untitled, title created by [[Lin Carter]].
*"The Skull of Silence" (first published in ''King Kull'', 1967). Also known as "The Screaming Skull of Silence".
*"The Striking of the Gong" (first published in the ''Second Book of Robert E. Howard'', 1976 although a version edited by Lin Carter was first published in ''King Kull'', 1967)
*"Swords of the Purple Kingdom" (first published in ''King Kull'', 1967)
*"Wizard and Warrior" (first published in ''Kull: The Fabulous Warrior King'', 1978 although a version edited by Lin Carter was first published in ''King Kull'', 1967) Originally untitled, title created by [[Lin Carter]].

Finally, Howard also wrote one Kull poem:
*"The King and the Oak"

==Style==
Kull is [[Conan the Barbarian]]'s direct literary forerunner. Conan's first story (both as a written piece and a published one), "[[The Phoenix on the Sword]]", is a rewriting of an earlier Kull story "[[By This Axe, I Rule]]".  The Conan version has a completely new backstory, less philosophy, more action, and various supernatural elements. Many passages of both stories still match word for word.<ref name="Harvey" /><ref name="Black Gate" />

One notable difference between Kull and Conan is their respective attitudes towards women. While Conan is a notable [[Promiscuity#Male promiscuity|womanizer]], finding a new love interest in nearly each of his stories, Kull is repeatedly mentioned as uninterested in having any such attachment. While highly chivalrous and on several occasions helping pairs of star-crossed lovers reach a happy consummation, he is never mentioned as having himself any relationship with a woman. Nor is Kull showing any interest in marrying and founding a dynasty, as Conan does in ''[[The Hour of the Dragon]]'', and none of Kull's wise advisors ever mentions this issue.

==Adaptations==
===Comics===
{{Redirect-distinguish|Kull (comics)|Knull (comics)}}
Kull has been adapted to comics by [[Marvel Comics]] with three series between 1971 and 1985.<ref name="IDW">{{cite web |last1=Ching |first1=Albert |title=EXCLUSIVE: Robert E.

He also appeared several times in ''[[The Savage Sword of Conan]]'' series and other anthology books. Another graphic novel, ''Kull: The Vale of Shadow'', was published in 1989.<ref>{{cite web |title=Marvel Graphic Novel: Kull ''The Vale of Shadow'' (1989) - OGN SC |url=http://comicbookdb.com/issue.php?ID=88374 |website=comicbookdb.com |access-date=27 March 2019}}</ref>

In 2006, [[Dark Horse Comics]] bought the rights to use Kull. The first series, titled ''Kull'', was based on "[[The Shadow Kingdom]]".<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Baichtal |first1=John |title=Dark Horse's Kull is Made of 100% Awesome |url=https://www.wired.com/2009/07/kullrocks/ |magazine=WIRED |access-date=27 March 2019 |date=10 July 2009}}</ref>  {{as of|2012}}, three mini-series were published, ''Kull'', ''Kull: The Hate Witch'', and ''Kull: The Cat and the Skull''.<ref name="IDW" />  Dark Horse also re-published the Marvel stories into two different Kull collections.  The Marvel color comics were collected into five volumes titled ''The Chronicles of Kull'', and the Marvel magazine format, black and white stories were collected into two volumes titled ''The Savage Sword of Kull''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fultz |first1=John R. |title=The Best KULL Comic Ever: "Demon in a Silvered Glass" |url=https://www.blackgate.com/2011/01/22/the-best-kull-comic-ever-%e2%80%9cdemon-in-a-silvered-glass%e2%80%9d/ |website=Black Gate |access-date=23 April 2019 |date=22 January 2011}}</ref>  Additional reprints were published in ''[[Robert E. Howard's Savage Sword (Dark Horse Comics)|Robert E. Howard's Savage Sword]]''.

In 2017, [[IDW Publishing]] got the license and began publishing ''Kull Eternal'', using [[The Mirrors of Tuzun Thune]] as a story foundation of Kull in a modern setting.<ref name="IDW" />

===Film===
The 1997 film ''[[Kull the Conqueror]]'' starred [[Kevin Sorbo]] in the title role.  The film was originally intended to be a Conan film and some elements of this remain.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.mtv.com/news/2760904/erics-bad-movies-kull-the-conqueror-1997/ |title= Eric's Bad Movies: Kull the Conqueror (1997) |author= Eric Snider |website= MTV |date= 27 November 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://popculture.com/entertainment/2017/05/20/arnold-schwarzenegger-conan-the-conqueror/ |title= Arnold Schwarzenegger Updates Status Of Next Conan Movie |author= Jamie Lovett |date= 20 May 2007 |website= Pop Culture Media }}</ref> The story's basis and several names can be directly traced to the Conan story "[[The Hour of the Dragon]]".

The 1982 ''[[Conan the Barbarian]]'' film starring [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] borrowed many elements from Howard's Kull stories. The main villain [[Thulsa Doom]] was from the Kull series, as was the serpent cult.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Williams |first=Owen |date=May 2010 |title=Conan the Unmade |magazine=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |issue=251 |pages=114–120 |location=London, United Kingdom |publisher=[[Bauer Media Group|Bauer Media]] |issn=0957-4948}}</ref> Conan's early life as a slave and gladiator in the movie borrows heavily from Kull's origin story and only shares minor details with Conan's literary origins; Conan was never a slave or a gladiator in Howard's stories, and left Cimmeria on his own will.

===Namesakes in other works of fiction===
Kull may have been the source of the name of [[King Kull (DC Comics)|King Kull]], a [[Fawcett Comics]] [[supervillain]] and foe of [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], later acquired by [[DC Comics]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} This King Kull combines barbarian elements with the bizarre science-fiction elements common in Captain Marvel stories of the [[Golden Age of comic books]].

== Chronology ==
In Robert E. Howard's story "Kings of the Night", a character living in the time of the Roman Empire states that a contemporary of Kull's "has been dead a hundred thousand years as we reckon time."

===Hulk Gang===
In the life of [[Old Man Logan]], its incarnation of [[Alternative versions of the Hulk#Bruce Banner|Bruce Banner]] got overloaded gamma radiation and was driven insane enough to impregnate She-Hulk. As a result, over time while claiming the West Coast of the United States as his domain after overthrowing Abomination, Hulk's [[hillbilly]] grandchildren helped to form the '''Hulk Gang''' where they acted as landlords to those that live in the rebranded part of the United States called Hulkland. In addition, they reside in a series of caves and trailers. The Hulk Gang beat or killed anyone who did not pay their rent on time.

There were two versions of the Hulk Gang in the similar Earths:

Upon returning and finding his family dead, Logan was informed of what happened by his neighbor Abraham Donovan causing Logan to bring out his claws for the first time.<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol. 3) #72. Marvel Comics.</ref> Logan proceeded to hunt down and kill the Hulk Gang members Beau Banner, Bobbie-Jo Banner, Charlie Banner, Elrod Banner, Eustace Banner, Luke Banner, Otis Banner, and Rufus Banner where he killed them. When he made his way to Pappy Banner who admitted that he got tired of being a supervillain landlord and wanted to fight Logan for old time sake by having his family killed, Logan engaged him in his Hulk form in battle and emerged as the victor. He spared Billy-Bob Banner and took custody of Hulk's infant son Bruce Banner Jr.<ref>''Wolverine: Old Man Logan Giant-Size'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

====Hulk Gang (Earth-21293)====

In the midst of the war in Subterranea when Mole Man went missing, Kala left for the surface to find help in fighting Mole Man's forces and she ran into [[Iron Man]].

Digger and Landslide assisted Iron Man in fighting off the Netherworlders who wanted Kala to become their leader again.

{{short description|Several fictional groups in the Marvel universe}}
Several [[Character (arts)|fictional]] groups of mutants have used the name '''Hellions''' in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The Hellions have always been portrayed as rivals of various teams of younger [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] heroes in the [[X-Men]] [[Media franchise|franchise]], initially as actual villains and later on a team that was more of a school rival than actual enemies of the X-Men.

The first and most notable incarnation of the Hellions were students of [[Emma Frost]] and the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]'s [[Massachusetts Academy (comics)|Massachusetts Academy]], and were rivals of the [[New Mutants]]. The original Hellions first appeared in ''New Mutants'' #16 (June 1984), created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Sal Buscema]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=168}}</ref> This version of the Hellions ended after an attack by [[Trevor Fitzroy]] and a squadron of [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] that killed several Hellions.

Two later groups known as the Hellions or New Hellions both fought against various X groups such as [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]] and [[X-Force]].

In ''New X-Men: Academy X'' a new group of Hellions were introduced, this time they were a part of the [[Xavier Institute for Higher Learning]], the Hellions was one of several factions that the students were divided into including the New Mutants, with whom they had a rivalry. After the majority of mutants lost their powers in the ''[[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]'' storyline the Hellions were combined into one squad as the number of mutants was greatly reduced.

The original group of Hellions were apprentices of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] and students of its White Queen [[Emma Frost]]. While attending classes at Frost's [[Massachusetts Academy (comics)|Massachusetts Academy]], these young [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] secretly trained in the use of their powers in an underground complex beneath the school. They were longtime rivals of the [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]]'s students, the [[New Mutants]], and once held their own against the [[X-Men]]. The original Hellions were:<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=218}}</ref>

* '''[[Catseye (comics)|Catseye]]''' (Sharon Smith), an American girl who could transform her body into a purple [[felidae|feline]] or semi-feline state and shift her size between that of a house cat or a panther. This granted her razor sharp claws, enhanced senses and physical attributes, plus a prehensile tail. Catseye originally believed she was a cat with the ability to transform into a human.
* '''[[Empath (comics)|Empath]]''' (Manuel de la Rocha); a handsome, yet cruel and arrogant young Spanish man with the ability to sense and manipulate the emotions of others. 
* '''[[Jetstream (comics)|Jetstream]]''' (Haroum ibn Sallah al-Rashid), from Morocco, could generate bio-thermal energy that allowed him to propel himself through the air and move at superhuman speeds. Aided in flight by bionically implanted jets that focus his energies and a cybernetic guidance system.
* '''[[Roulette (Marvel Comics)|Roulette]]''' (Jennifer Stavros), an American girl from Atlantic City who could psionically influence probabilities, usually through colored disks of energy she generated and threw towards her targets: white disks for good luck, black disks for bad.
* '''[[Tarot (comics)|Tarot]]''' (Mari-Ange Colbert), a good-natured girl from Lyons, France who had the ability to see past and future events of other people due to a combination of her mutant powers and her tarot cards. She could also materialize and animate tangible images of the 2-D avatars/images on her tarot cards. Once materialized they are completely under her mental control and could do her bidding including aiding her in battle and flight. 
* '''[[Warpath (comics)|Thunderbird]]''' (James Proudstar), the younger brother of deceased X-Man [[Thunderbird (John Proudstar)|John Proudstar]] (the original Thunderbird), who possessed similar superhuman physical attributes, senses, and healing ability. He reformed and has served on the several X-Men teams under the codename, '''Warpath''', and is currently a member of the X-Men.

White Queen Emma Frost had another potential Hellion in [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]] (Angelica Jones), but kept the girl from joining the team on field missions while grooming her to be Frost's personal assassin. Firestar eventually learned of Frost's plans and left the Massachusetts Academy.<ref>''Firestar'' #1–4</ref>

After suffering a severe trauma at the hands of the [[Beyonder]],<ref>''The New Mutants'' #37</ref><ref>''Secret Wars II'' #9</ref> a number of the New Mutants were transferred to the Massachusetts Academy by [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] (then headmaster of [[X-Mansion|Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]]), due to their apparent need for psychic therapy from Emma Frost.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #38</ref> While at the academy, the transferred New Mutants — [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]], [[Karma (comics)|Karma]], [[Cypher (comics)|Cypher]], [[Magik (Illyana Rasputin)|Magik]], and [[Magma (comics)|Magma]] — were inducted into the Hellions.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #39</ref> They soon returned to Xavier's School after their recovery and the revelation that the White Queen had employed Empath to coerce Magneto into allowing the transfer.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #40</ref> After an alliance between the X-Men and the Hellfire Club<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #209</ref> and Magneto's ascension to the Inner Circle as its White King,<ref>''The New Mutants'' #51</ref> relations between the Hellions and New Mutants improved.

Magma, realizing she held feelings for Empath, eventually returned to the Hellions and the Massachusetts Academy;<ref>''The New Mutants'' #56-57</ref> the two would later leave the team to travel to her home in Nova Roma.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #62</ref> James Proudstar also left the Hellions, reemerging with [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and the remnants of the New Mutants in [[X-Force]].<ref>''The New Mutants'' #99</ref>

Superstrong and durable Beef (Buford Wilson) and bioelectricity-projecting Bevatron (Fabian Marechal-Julbin) were later additions to the group. They were present when the Hellions unsuccessfully challenged the [[New Warriors]] over the allegiance of their former member, Firestar.<ref>''New Warriors'' #9–10</ref>

The original Hellions however came to an end when [[Trevor Fitzroy]] and a squadron of [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] attacked a Hellfire Club function; Jetstream and Beef were killed immediately,<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #281</ref> while Tarot, the rest of the Hellions and many guests erroneously believed to be unnamed Hellions were captured and drained of their life energies by Fitzroy.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #282</ref> Emma Frost's guilt over her students' deaths led to her eventual reform.
These Hellions were some of the many deceased mutants resurrected via the [[Techno-organic virus#Transmode virus|Transmode Virus]] by [[Selene (comics)|Selene]] and [[Eli Bard]] during the "[[Necrosha]]" storyline running through ''[[New Mutants#New Mutants .28vol. 3.29|New Mutants]]'', ''[[X-Force#2008 ongoing series|X-Force]]'' and ''[[X-Men: Legacy#X-Men: Legacy|X-Men: Legacy]]''. They survived and are once again acting as a team.

With the establishing of the new sovereign mutant nation of Krakoa, the original Hellions and Bevatron, now free of the Transmode Virus, have all taken up residence there.

==Emplate's Hellions==
The next group of Hellions was organized by the parasitic [[Emplate]] to attack [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]], the new class of Emma Frost's students. This group appeared twice<ref>''Generation X'' #11-12</ref><ref>''Generation X'' #57</ref> with slightly different members.

* '''[[Bulwark (comics)|Bulwark]]''' (Oswald Boeglin) - Bulwark could expand his muscle mass. He would reappear alongside Emplate,<ref>''Generation X'' #14</ref> but was later captured and killed by the revamped [[Weapon X]] program.<ref>''Weapon X'' vol. 2, #5 (March 2003)</ref> He was only a member during the team's first appearance.
* '''D.O.A.''' (George Baker) - D.O.A. is an energy vampire much like Emplate and his skin is invulnerable to most damage.
* '''Lady [[Gayle Edgerton]]''' - Edgerton was a psychic vampire. She is a former girlfriend of Generation X's [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]].<ref>''X-Men: Prime''</ref> Emplate took her powers back when she switched sides after she helped capture Chamber. She was only on the team during its first appearance.
* '''[[Murmur (Marvel Comics)#Murmur (Hellions)|Murmur]]''' (Allan Rennie) - Murmur could open teleportation portals within his line of sight. Depowered.
* '''Nocturne''' (Bridget Warner) - Nocturne controls an ebon energy. She was part of Emplate's second team.
* '''Vincente''' (Vincente Cimetta) - Vincente can change his body from solid to liquid or gas. He can make his gas state poisonous to inhale. An alternate version had previously appeared as a member of the [[Age of Apocalypse#Generation Next|Age of Apocalypse's Generation Next]].
* '''Wrap''' (Nick Bisley) - Wrap possesses super strength. He is an energy being whose bandages hold him together. He was part of Emplate's second team.

Of note is the fact that Emplate never called his group the "Hellions". This name was only attached in Marvel Comics' advertising.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

==The New Hellions==
A group of self-proclaimed "New Hellions" emerged to fight [[X-Force]], whose members included some from the team's past:<ref>''X-Force'' #82, 87-90. Marvel Comics.</ref>

* '''[[Bedlam (comics)|Bedlam]]''' (Jesse Aaronson) - Bedlam can produce a bioelectrical field that disrupts electrical systems. He briefly defected from X-Force to join his brother and the New Hellions.

* '''[[Tarot (comics)|Tarot]]''' (Mari-Ange Colbert) - Tarot is an original Hellion inexplicably resurrected, Tarot's life was somehow joined to King Bedlam. When he was depowered, she died again.

After the reopening of the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute for Higher Learning]] various training squads are formed. One such group of students, under the tutelage of headmistress [[Emma Frost]], is dubbed "the Hellions".<ref>''New X-Men: Academy X'' #2</ref> They have an intense rivalry with another such group, the [[New Mutants#The New Mutants, vol. 2|New Mutants]], echoing the relationship between the two original groups of the same names.  Membership consists of:

* '''[[Dust (comics)|Dust]]''' (Sooraya Qadir) - can convert her body into a malleable cloud of dust that she can manipulate at will and which grants immunity to magic. She was one of the 27 students at the Xavier Institute to retain her powers after M-Day. Dust is a member of the X-Men and a student at the [[X-Mansion|Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]].

* '''[[Rockslide (comics)|Rockslide]]''' (Santo Vaccarro) - forms animated rock bodies for himself that grants him superhuman strength, durability and endurance. In addition, Rockslide is able to violently detonate his entire body at will and then reform on command. Santo is one of the 27 students at the Xavier Institute to retain his powers after M-Day. He is currently a student at the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning and a member of the X-Men.
* '''Specter''' (Dallas Gibson) - could merge with his shadow to increase his strength, speed and durability. In this shadow form, he could see in darkness and was immune to darkness-based attacks. Shortly after the squads are formed, he was transferred twice, ending up on the Corsairs squad. He was depowered during M-Day and living with his grandparents.
* '''[[Tag (comics)|Tag]]''' (Brian Cruz) - could place a psionic imprint upon himself or others that attracted or repelled other people. He was depowered during M-Day. Brian dies on the bus that is bombed by William Stryker.

After M-Day, the cataclysmic event that decimated the world's mutant population, only 27 of the 182 students enrolled at the Xavier Institute retain their powers, and the remaining students are folded into a single training squad, the [[New X-Men (2004 series)|New X-Men]]. For the Hellions, only Tag and Specter were depowered.

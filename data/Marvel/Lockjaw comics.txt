==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}
He first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #45 (December 1965), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=216}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Lockjaw was born on the island of [[Attilan]] (formerly in the Atlantic Ocean and eventually moved to the Moon). Many times he has brought Inhumans to Earth and back again. At times, his powers have been manipulated by evil forces, most usually by [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus the Mad]]. Lockjaw and the Royal Family encountered [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]]' creation, the Trikon, and were driven from Attilan's Great Refuge in exile.<ref>''Inhumans Special'' #1</ref>

Lockjaw first appeared as a member of the Inhumans when they attempted to retrieve [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] from the outside world and take her back to Attilan. This led them into conflict with the [[Fantastic Four]], the first humans they met, who were harboring Medusa after rescuing her from the villainous [[Frightful Four]]. Accordingly, Lockjaw is indirectly responsible for revealing the existence of Attilan to the outside world. They returned to Attilan and became trapped in Maximus' "negative zone" barrier around the Great Refuge.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #45-48</ref>

Lockjaw is able to escape and becomes separated from his city. He roams the country for some time, accidentally terrorizing the local citizens, until he meets up with [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]] and [[Wyatt Wingfoot]]. He journeyed with the pair in their attempt to breach the "negative zone" barrier.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #55-58; ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #4</ref> Before long, the Inhumans were freed from the "negative zone" barrier, and Lockjaw transported [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]] to New York, and brought [[Triton (comics)|Triton]] from Attilan to rescue [[Mister Fantastic]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #61-62</ref> Lockjaw was later compelled to return Crystal to Attilan by Maximus.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #82-83</ref>

With Crystal, Lockjaw was captured by [[Diablo (Marvel Comics)|Diablo]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #117</ref> They later rescued the injured [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]].<ref>''Avengers'' #110</ref> Before long, Lockjaw attended the wedding of Quicksilver and Crystal.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #150</ref> He also brought the Fantastic Four to Attilan to battle Thraxton.<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #12</ref>

===Further adventures===
At one point, Quicksilver and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] witnessed what appeared to be Lockjaw, apparently a sentient being once mutated by [[Terrigen Mists]], speaking to them. This convinces Quicksilver not to expose his daughter [[Luna (comics)|Luna]] to the Mists.<ref>''The Thing'' #3</ref> However, Lockjaw later brought Quicksilver to Washington, D.C., in search of [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], and Quicksilver there stated that Lockjaw's sentience was actually a hoax perpetrated on the Thing by [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]] and [[Gorgon (Inhuman)|Gorgon]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #71–72</ref>

Lockjaw brought the other Inhumans to Earth in search of Medusa when she fled Attilan to avoid a compulsory abortion. He also transported the injured Triton back to Attilan.<ref>''Marvel Graphic Novel: The Inhumans''</ref> With Crystal, he later summoned the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] to help battle [[Thane Ector]] and the Brethren.<ref>''Avengers'' #334</ref> With the Avengers, he battled the Brethren.<ref>''Avengers'' #336-338</ref>

As noted in ''[[Ka-Zar (Kevin Plunder)|Ka-Zar]]'' #12, Lockjaw also travels to the [[Heroes Reborn (1996 comic)|Heroes Reborn]] universe with his Inhuman family. This visit lasts for about a year; all are returned successfully.<ref>''Ka-Zar'' #12</ref>

Having always been particularly fond of Ben Grimm, Lockjaw elects to stay with him. Ben, fondly recounting that he "always wanted a dog", accepted. It is not known why Lockjaw did not accompany Ben Grimm when he felt the need to retreat to France during the ''[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]''.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Lockjaw is featured into the 2006 limited series ''[[Son of M]]''. With the majority of the mutants on Earth having been rendered powerless, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] decides to steal the [[Inhumans]] mutagenic Terrigen Mists and re-power willing mutants. Lockjaw is convinced to help him on the mission. Traveling with Quicksilver's daughter [[Luna (comics)|Luna]], they traverse the Earth, heading to such places as [[Genosha]]. The other Inhumans follow.<ref>''Son of M'' (2006)</ref>

Later, Lockjaw rejoins Black Bolt, Medusa and other Inhumans in order to assist a super-human strikeforce in taking down the confused [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]].<ref>''New Avengers'' #9</ref>

Lockjaw assists his family tracking down Black Bolt, who had been captured by the Skrulls. Using technology gained from their allies, the Kree, Lockjaw's abilities are upgraded, allowing him to teleport much farther.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Inhumans''</ref>

===New allies===
In 2009, Lockjaw received a four-issue mini-series titled ''[[Lockjaw and the Pet Avengers]]'', teaming with [[Lockheed (comics)|Lockheed]], [[Redwing (Marvel Comics)|Redwing]], Ms. Lion ([[Aunt May]]'s puppy from ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends (1981 TV series)|Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]''), [[Zabu]], [[Robbie Baldwin#Fictional character biography|Niels the Cat/Hairball]], and a new frog named [[List of Thor supporting characters#Other supporting characters|Throg]]. This series involves Lockjaw bringing the [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Gauntlet]] together with the assistance of animal allies.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/090202-Lockjaw.html | work=[[Newsarama]] | title=Inside Lockjaw and the Pet Avengers | access-date=2009-03-22}}</ref> The series spawned two additional mini-series with the Pet Avengers.

Lockjaw re-joins his Inhuman family for the conflicts that eventually led to them taking over the Kree empire. This leads to the seeming loss of Black Bolt despite Crystal and Lockjaw's best efforts.<ref>''War of Kings'' #1-6 (March-Aug. 2009)</ref> This conflict also leads to the ravaging of the Shi'ar Empire. As his family determines who will rule, Lockheed is seen playing closely with Luna and assisting with Shi'ar recovery efforts.<ref>''War of Kings: Who Will Rule?'' one-shot (Nov. 2009)</ref> Lockjaw again becomes involved with gathering the Infinity Gauntlet together when the Soul Gem is lost and later found.<ref>''New Avengers'' #3 (2013)</ref> Lockjaw was also sent by Medusa to keep an eye on recent Inhuman [[Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan)]],<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' #7 (2014)</ref> and helps her in her battle against a cockatiel/human hybrid clone of [[Thomas Edison]] known as The Inventor.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' #8-11 (2014)</ref>

During the ''[[Inhumans vs. X-Men]]'' storyline, Lockjaw was taking a nap when he is knocked out by [[Fantomex]].<ref>''IVX'' #2</ref>

At the time when Lockjaw was on a mission to free Black Bolt from the deep space torture prison, a flashback revealed that Lockjaw got his powers during an Inhuman experiment on canines.<ref>''Black Bolt'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the pages of "[[Death of the Inhumans]]", the Kree eventually initiated a murdering mission to bring Black Bolt to their ranks and across the stars as thousands of Inhumans were killed by Vox, the first of a new race of Super-Inhuman, built by the Kree. Black Bolt quickly sent Lockjaw to bring his brother to him, however Vox had already reached New Arctilan and was fighting Maximus when Lockjaw arrived, and while the canine was able to temporarily take down the Super-Inhuman, the latter released his full power that not only burned down New Arctilan but in the process also apparently killed Lockjaw and Maximus.<ref>''Death of the Inhumans'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Lockjaw can teleport himself and nearby living creatures and matter to any destination on the Earth or the Moon. He can also open passages between dimensions. Energy barriers that are seemingly impenetrable to others seem to pose no problem to him. Lockjaw also has the ability to psionically trace a given "scent" across dimensional space.

Lockjaw also once seemingly sensed danger from far off, when [[Doctor Doom]] had manipulated [[Silver Surfer]]'s powers.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Lockjaw is capable of chewing and swallowing inorganic material, such as scraps of sophisticated robots, with no ill effect. It is not known if this is his primary source of nourishment.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Lockjaw seemingly has "super-canine" strength in his jaw. Once he locked on to the Thing's arm and the Thing could not get him to let go.

In the ''[[Secret Invasion]]: Inhumans'' mini-series, the Royal Family enter into an alliance with the [[Kree]] to free [[Black Bolt]] from his [[Skrull]] captors. To that end, the Kree greatly enhance Lockjaw's teleportation powers, enabling him to teleport himself and others over vast interplanetary distances.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Inhumans'' #3</ref>

== Reception ==
=== Critical reception ===
Liz Wyatt of ''[[CBR.com]]'' referred to Lockjaw as one of Marvel's "fan favorite animal companions," stating, "Lockjaw is perhaps the cutest Inhuman out there...though we might be biased on that count. Lockjaw is not only extremely adorable, loyal, and okay...he's massive as well, but he's also very useful. You see, Lockjaw can teleport almost as well as he can drool. Which is saying something! Lockjaw is a massive bulldog, and an Inhuman to boot. He's made friends and allies with more than one Marvel character, and we're not surprised by that fact. This is one dog who has plenty of room for love in his heart. And that is why we love him so much."<ref name="Wyatt">{{Cite web |last=Wyatt |first=Liz |date=2019-10-15 |title=Marvel: 10 Fan Favorite Animal Companions, Ranked |url=https://www.cbr.com/marvel-fan-favorite-animal-companions/ |access-date=2022-09-04 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> Chase Magnett of ''[[Comicbook.com]]'' called Lockjaw "one of the longest-lasting and most beloved super pets in existence," writing, "The bottom line with Lockjaw is that he's a very good dog. One of the best. If there were a We Rate Dogs Twitter in the Marvel universe, it would almost certainly give Lockjaw a 15/10. As a character, he reminds us of everything we love about our canine companions with an extra dose of superheroic powers and adventure on top. Lockjaw is loyal and loving, filled with fun, and there whenever his people need him. Whether you have a dog in your home or prefer to admire them from afar, the appeal of the species is obvious when looking at this big, jowled face. He's just such a good dog."<ref>{{Cite web |title=8 Reasons Why We Love Lockjaw |url=https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/why-lockjaw-matters/ |access-date=2022-09-04 |website=Marvel |language=en}}</ref> CA Staff of ''[[ComicsAlliance]]'' asserted, "It's hard to imagine anyone not loving Lockjaw. He's a huge puppy dog who teleports you to where you need to go! He's so smart that for a while the story was that he wasn't a dog at all — but thankfully that was retconned, because Lockjaw is the best dog, and not letting him be one kind of ruins him. He's loyal to the Inhuman Royal Family — he even has a tuning fork on his head to match his master — but he's also spent time with the Thing and Ms. Marvel, two of Marvel's best characters. who are made even better with Lockjaw around. He may not star in many stories of his own, but if you could magically wish one comics character to life and hang out with them, Lockjaw would be an excellent choice."<ref name=":1"/> Simon Winter of ''[[WhatCulture]]'' said, "Despite being a dog, Lockjaw is by far the best member of the Inhumans. As 'Companion to the Royal Family of the Inhumans', Lockjaw plays an important part in keeping New Attilan safe from the countless threats it faces. However, if you think he's just a giant slobbering eating machine... Well, you'd be mostly right, but there's way more to this lovable mutt than meets the eye. In one of Marvel's greatest decisions, Lockjaw got his own Avengers team in 2009's ''Lockjaw and the Pet Avengers''."<ref name="Winter">{{Cite web |last=Winter |first=Simon |date=2020-10-19 |title=10 Marvel Pets You Wish You Could Adopt |url=https://whatculture.com/comics/10-marvel-pets-you-wish-you-could-adopt |access-date=2022-09-04 |website=WhatCulture.com |language=en}}</ref>

=== Volumes ===
==== ''Lockjaw and the Pet Avengers'' ====
According to Marvel Comics announced that ''Lockjaw and the Pet Avengers'' #1 sold out in March 2009.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Jeff |date=2009-05-15 |title=Lockjaw and the Pet Avengers #1 Sells Out |url=https://blog.gocollect.com/lockjaw-and-the-pet-avengers-1-sells-out/ |access-date=2022-09-04 |website=GoCollect |language=en-US}}</ref>

Doug Zawisza of ''[[CBR.com]]'' called ''Lockjaw and the Pet Avengers'' #1 an "all ages tour de force," stating, "Branded with an "All Ages" tag, this book is one for all ages—older fans of the Walter Simonson era of "Thor", fans of "Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends", X-Men fans, or just Marvel comics enthusiasts. This book serves as a reminder that not every comic needs to be hard-coded into continuity, so put that slide rule down and grab a copy of this book, as it brings an enthusiastic story to readers of the Marvel Universe. [...] This is a title that has come out of nowhere and deserves some recognition as it takes less than Z-list characters and offers an enjoyable tale that can be shared with long-term fans and younger readers alike. Eliopoulos gives of these characters each a voice and a reason to join up, but among them Lockheed really touched me in a way I hadn't thought of much before now."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Zawisza |first=Doug |date=2009-05-17 |title=Lockjaw and the Pet Avengers #1 |url=https://www.cbr.com/lockjaw-and-the-pet-avengers-1/ |access-date=2022-09-04 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> Daniel Crown of ''[[IGN]]'' gave ''Lockjaw and the Pet Avengers'' #1 a grade of 6.5 out of 10, asserting, "Ultimately, it's somewhat refreshing to see a child-friendly title like this one firmly set in the Marvel mythos proper. Lord knows the comic industry, and specifically the superhero genre, needs more all-ages comics. And to that end, ''Lockjaw and the Pet Avengers'' is just cute enough to skate by for adult readers, and should be more than acceptable for any little tyke who makes it a habit to ride their father or mother's leg into the comic store every Wednesday."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Crown |first=Daniel |date=2009-05-13 |title=Lockjaw and the Pet Avengers #1 Review |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/05/13/lockjaw-and-the-pet-avengers-1-review |access-date=2022-09-04 |website=IGN |language=en}}</ref>

==== ''Lockjaw and the Pet Avengers Unleashed'' ====
Doug Zawisza of ''[[CBR.com]]'' said, "The Pets are fabulously rendered by Ig Guara, the artistic beast master from the previous series. Guara, thankfully, has returned for another go at the Pets, bringing expression and emotion to these critters while never failing to deliver fantastic backgrounds, foregrounds, and cursory characters. This issue only has two panels with human beings in it, but with Guara drawing Eliopoulos' story, there is certainly no shortage of characterization. Sotomayor and Roberts color the living daylights out of this book, making the frogs look like amphibians, and setting off Ms. Lion's fur, giving each animal an almost tangible difference in their appearance. Sabino's lettering is equally well-suited to this story, giving many of the animals a different tone and tenor. The rumble of the hippos is different from the resonance of Hairball's speech. The mystery of Frog Thor coupled with the last page reveal are a bit more than one would expect from an "All Ages" book, but it just proves that this is truly "All Ages" and not "intended for younger readers, but hoping older readers think it's cute enough to pay for." Well done, I say.  A single page Hulk-Pet Avengers story ends this issue with the characters teaming up with Blue Hulk to go to Ice Cream Mountain. It's silly and fun, and nice little extra for the younger readers written by Audrey Loeb and drawn by Dario Brizuela."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Zawisza |first=Doug |date=2010-03-10 |title=Lockjaw and the Pet Avengers Unleashed #1 |url=https://www.cbr.com/lockjaw-and-the-pet-avengers-unleashed-1/ |access-date=2022-09-04 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> Kevin Lee of ''[[Screen Rant]]'' included the ''Lockjaw and the Pet Avengers Unleashed'' comic book series in their "10 best super-pets comics storylines" list, saying, "A thought-provoking follow-up to ''Lockjaw and the Pet Avengers (2009)'', ''Unleashed #1-4 (2010)'' sees the Pet Avengers assemble when their mystical connection to Throg is lost. Eventually, they track Throg down, discovering the warped Golden One is destroying the mythical realm and plotting an incursion into the Earth realm. The dynamic creator duo of Super Pets, Eliopoulos and Guara, come together in this imaginative tale of finding oneself, friends, and the power of love when fueled by imagination."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lee |first=Kevin |date=2022-08-01 |title=10 Best Super-Pets Comics Storylines |url=https://screenrant.com/best-super-pets-comics-storylines/ |access-date=2022-09-04 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref>

==== ''Lockjaw'' - 2018 ====
According to [[Diamond Comic Distributors|Diamond Comics Distributors]], ''Lockjaw'' #2 was the 190th best selling comic book in March 2018.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mayo |first=John |date=2018-04-09 |title=Dark Nights: Metal, Doomsday Clock Top Sales Charts for March 2018 |url=https://www.cbr.com/march-2018-comic-book-sales-charts/ |access-date=2022-09-05 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Comichron: March 2018 Comic Book Sales to Comics Shops |url=https://www.comichron.com/monthlycomicssales/2018/2018-03.html |access-date=2022-09-05 |website=www.comichron.com}}</ref>

Brandon Davis of ''[[Comicbook.com]]'' gave ''Lockjaw'' #1 a grade of 4 out of 5, stating, "A tale of man's best friend kicks off as Lockjaw branches from the reins of Black Bolt and his Attilan home for a planet-trotting adventure. Daniel Kibblesmith pairs the oversized teleporting pup with once-hero D-Man for an adventure which will certainly teach them to rely on each other, possibly one more than the other, in an unnecessary but potentially quite fun adventure."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Comic Book Reviews for This Week: 2/28/2018 |url=https://comicbook.com/comics/news/comic-book-reviews-february-28/ |access-date=2022-09-04 |website=Comics |language=en}}</ref> Jesse Schedeen of ''[[IGN]]'' gave ''Lockjaw'' #1 a grade of 8.6 out of 10, saying, " By now readers should have a certain idea of what to expect from a comic about Lockjaw. He's a gigantic, teleporting dog with a habit of getting into wacky adventures when he isn't busy teleporting the Inhumans to and fro. Tonally, we're not exactly talking The Dark Knight Returns here. But while this new miniseries is every bit as goofy as one would expect, it also manages to weave in a surprising amount of emotional depth in the process. [...] It's understandable if readers are feeling burnt out on the Inhumans at this point. However, ''Lockjaw'' #1 offers an entertaining diversion from the norm that places more emphasis on Lockjaw's new partner than the trusty canine himself. This issue delivers all the wacky superhero fun one would expect, but it anchors that fun with a surprisingly deep look at a fallen hero in crisis."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Schedeen |first=Jesse |date=2018-03-01 |title=Marvel's Lockjaw Comic Defies Expectations (Lockjaw #1 Review) |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/03/01/marvels-lockjaw-comic-defies-expectations-lockjaw-1-review |access-date=2022-09-04 |website=IGN |language=en}}</ref>

==Other versions==
===[[Age of Apocalypse]]===
In the reality where Apocalypse had conquered North America, Apocalypse approached the Inhumans to gain access to the Terrigen Mist; however the Inhumans refused to deliver such material, until one of them, Maximus, made a secret deal with Apocalypse. Maximus would give the Terrigen Mist to Apocalypse if the High Lord granted him a position in the Horsemen. Maximus then took over the Inhumans Royal Family, slaying all those who stood in his way, including Lockjaw. As the new Death, Maximus created twisted clones based on the royal family that were loyal to him. The clone of Lockjaw clashed with the X-Men when they traveled to the Blue Area of the Moon to try to kill Apocalypse during a time when he was recuperating there. Lockjaw used its tuning fork to knock out Morph. The X-Men freed themselves and defeated Maximus. Despite the Inhumans' initial victory, Lockjaw and all of the Royal Family were killed when the Ship was destroyed by Sunfire.<ref>''Tales From The Age of Apocalypse'' #1</ref>

===Earth X===
In the alternate future of ''[[Earth X]]'', Lockjaw is shot by some gaseous bullet and murdered by [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]]. His teleportation-forehead assembly is seemingly the only part of him that has survived. It is used by Black Bolt and the other Inhumans to investigate happenings on Earth.

Lockjaw is one of the few Royal family members to survive to the year 2099; Maximus the Mad had slain the rest. The Inhumans had established themselves on a space station also called Attilan.<ref>''Marvel Knights 2099'' (2004)</ref>

===Marvel Zombies===
Lockjaw appears zombified along with the Royal Family of the Inhumans, creating a portal for them to meet with the Kingpin.<ref>''Marvel Zombies 3'' #2</ref> He is later seen trying to attack [[Machine Man]]. The heroic android tricks Lockjaw into teleporting to the mainstream Marvel Universe. Lockjaw is tricked into eating an explosive-laden human brain. He is destroyed in the explosion.<ref>''Marvel Zombies 3'' #4</ref> Another Lockjaw is seen when the zombie virus spreads to "Earth Z". He too is zombiefied and assists in slaying the "[[Warbound]]". He was captured by Machine Man, Ultron and Jocasta.<ref>''Marvel Zombies Return'' #4 (2009)</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
Lockjaw also appears in ''Ultimate Fantastic Four Annual'' #1. In this incarnation, he has teleportation powers as well. He leaves the Inhumans' Himalayan refuge with Crystal, who is running away because she was being forced to marry Black Bolt's brother, Maximus (only Crystal suspects he is mad). Lockjaw assists in saving Crystal from her pursuing guards but they eventually drag her back home anyway. They leave him behind and he brings the Fantastic Four for assistance. This is not well received as most of Inhuman society severely dislikes any outsiders. Black Bolt ends up destroying the evacuated Attilan simply because the Four "contaminated" it. Several of the Inhumans indicate they had conspired for Lockjaw to be left behind in the human world.<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four Annual'' #1 (2005)</ref>

===Video games===
* Lockjaw appears as a non-playable hero in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]''.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} His duty was to send the heroes to the [[Shi'ar]] galaxy and [[Skrull]] homeworld to gather implements necessary to defeating a divinely-empowered [[Doctor Doom]]. Also though not there in appearance, the game implies that the mini-portals used in the game for midpoint to home-base transport are made by Lockjaw since every time the player tries to create a portal outside the circumstances when that is possible, the message "Lockjaw cannot create a portal in that area" appears. This creates somewhat of a continuity error since when the player gains that ability, it is attributed to an experimental teleportation device created by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] He also has special "conversations" with [[Spider-Man]], [[Deadpool]], and [[Thing (comics)|Thing]].
* Lockjaw appears as a non-playable character in ''[[Marvel: Contest of Champions]]'' that only appears on the Gifting Badge and in ''Have You Seen This Dog?'' dialogue.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

* A statue of Lockjaw appears in the 2018 ''[[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' video game.

===Non-fiction===
* The debate over Lockjaw's sentience is discussed in Peter David's non-fiction book ''Writing For Comics''.

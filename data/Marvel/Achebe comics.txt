== Fictional character biography ==
Achebe's origin and past is vague, but is assumed and believed by the United States government that he was a Ghudazan farmer nicknamed "Bob" who tended to leftist rebels from the neighboring country of Ujanka when the men were driven across the Ghudazan/Ujankan border and onto Achebe's property.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Clough |first=Rob |date=2021-02-03 |title=Stories Black Panther Fans Most Want To See In The Wakanda Spinoff - Looper |url=https://www.looper.com/326315/stories-black-panther-fans-most-want-to-see-in-the-wakanda-spinoff/ |access-date=2022-10-16 |website=Looper.com |language=en-US}}</ref> The soldiers repaid Achebe's kindness by leaving him for dead after they seduced his wife, razed his farm, and stabbed him thirty-two times.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lealos |first=Shawn S. |date=2021-06-14 |title=Black Panther: Main Comic Book Villains, Ranked Lamest To Coolest |url=https://screenrant.com/black-panther-coolest-worst-comic-villains/ |access-date=2022-10-16 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref> According to [[urban legend]]s, Achebe survived by selling his soul to [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]].<ref>{{Cite web |author1=Jason Wiese |date=2020-11-29 |title=5 Marvel Characters Kevin Hart Would Be Perfect For |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2559276/marvel-characters-kevin-hart-would-be-perfect-for |access-date=2022-10-16 |website=CINEMABLEND |language=en}}</ref> Then, he went on to kill everyone who had ever interacted with his wife, destroying the homes of his victims and stabbing each one thirty-two times.<ref name ="BP3">{{Cite comic|writer = Christopher Priest|penciller = Mark Texeira|inker = Mark Texeira|colorist = Brian Haberlin|letterer = Rich S and Comicraft's Siobhan Hanna|editor = Joe Quesada and Jimmy Palmiotti|story = Original Sin|title = Black Panther|volume = 3|issue = #3|date = January 1999|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web |author1=Matt Wood |date=2018-02-22 |title=5 Marvel Villains We'd Love To See In Black Panther 2 |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2315181/5-marvel-villains-wed-love-to-see-in-black-panther-2 |access-date=2022-10-16 |website=CINEMABLEND |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Grubbs |first=Victor |date=2019-01-16 |title=The Next Big Things: 20 D-List Marvel Characters We Hope The MCU Turns Into Household Names |url=https://www.cbr.com/mcu-d-listers-into-a-listers/ |access-date=2022-10-16 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref>

After attending [[Yale Law School]], Achebe returned to Ghudazan where he helped instigate an [[Ethnic conflict|ethnic war]].<ref name ="BP3"/> When [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] established a [[refugee camp]] on the outskirts of [[Wakanda]] for those seeking asylum from the conflict, Achebe infiltrated it and exacerbated unease between the refugees and the Wakandans. Achebe then lured Black Panther out of Wakanda by corrupting one of his charities situated in America and by having the organization's "[[poster child]]" killed.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Christopher Priest|penciller = Mark Texeira|inker = Mark Texeira|colorist = Brian Haberlin|letterer = RS and Comicraft's Siobhan Hanna|editor = Joe Quesada and Jimmy Palmiotti|story = The Client|title = Black Panther|volume = 3|issue = #1|date = November 1998|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Christopher Priest|penciller = Mark Texeira|inker = Mark Texeira|colorist = Avalon Color|letterer = Rich S and Comicraft's Siobhan Hanna|editor = Joe Quesada and Jimmy Palmiotti|story = Invasion|title = Black Panther|volume = 3|issue = #2|date = December 1998|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

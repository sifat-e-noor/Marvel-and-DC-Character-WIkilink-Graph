'''''New X-Men''''' is a [[superhero]] [[comic book]] series published by [[Marvel Comics]] within the [[X-Men]] franchise.

After the end of [[Grant Morrison]]'s run on [[X-Men: Legacy|''X-Men'' vol. 2]] titled ''[[New X-Men (2001 series)|New X-Men]]'', the title was used for a new series, [[New_Mutants#The_New_Mutants,_vol._2|''New X-Men: Academy X'']] during the [[X-Men ReLoad]] event. The title was later shortened to simply ''New X-Men'' in 2006 when the new creative team of [[Craig Kyle]] and [[Christopher Yost]] took over the series with issue #20.

Whereas the other ''X-Men'' comics mostly deal with established adult [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]], this series concentrates on the lives of young students residing at the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute for Higher Learning]] as they learn to control their powers.

After the 2007 crossover ''[[X-Men: Messiah Complex]]'', the ''New X-Men'' title was canceled and briefly relaunched as ''[[Young X-Men]]'' for 12 issues. The series was written by [[Marc Guggenheim]]. After the first arc of ''Young X-Men'', the characters began appearing in the pages of ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]''. With the cancellation of ''Young X-Men'' the characters were folded onto the main X-Men books, appearing most prominently in the pages of ''[[X-Men: Legacy]]'', ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (comics)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'', and most recently, in ''[[X-Men (comic book)|X-Men]]''.

==''Decimation''==
In the aftermath of the ''[[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]'' event known as M-Day, the mutant student body in the academy dropped from 182 to 27. At least 45 depowered students were killed and, of the remaining students, [[Emma Frost]] picked a select group to train as New X-Men. These new X-Men were [[Dust (comics)|Dust]], [[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]], [[Hellion (Marvel Comics)|Hellion]], [[Mercury (Marvel Comics)|Mercury]], [[Rockslide (comics)|Rockslide]], [[Surge (Marvel Comics)|Surge]] (appointed leader) and [[X-23]]. As time progressed, several members were added and/or earned the right to be on the team, such as [[Anole (comics)|Anole]], [[Armor (comics)|Armor]], [[Gentle (comics)|Gentle]], [[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]] and [[Prodigy (David Alleyne)|Prodigy]]. The rest of the students were instructed to remain on school grounds, some providing assistance to the current [[X-Men]] teams and trainees. Some M-day survivors and depowered students either left the mansion or were killed off during villainous attacks by [[William Stryker|Stryker]] and his men, or various other enemies.

==''Young X-Men''==
{{Main|Young X-Men}}
The ''Young X-Men'' series launched as part of the ''[[X-Men]]'' storyline "[[X-Men: Divided We Stand|Divided We Stand]]" in April, 2008. Written by [[Marc Guggenheim]] and pencilled by [[Yanick Paquette]], it featured a line-up of [[Blindfold (comics)|Blindfold]], [[Dust (comics)|Dust]], [[Rockslide (comics)|Rockslide]], [[Wolf Cub (comics)|Wolf Cub]] and three new characters: [[Graymalkin]], [[Ink (comics)|Ink]], and in the second issue, [[Cipher (comics)|Cipher]]. The first arc involved the group being formed by [[Donald Pierce]], who thanks to changes inflicted upon him by the [[Purifiers (Marvel Comics)|Purifiers]], impersonates [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] as part of an elaborate plot to kill the young mutants who he sees are the last generation of mutants born prior to M-Day. The group are manipulated into fighting members of the [[New Mutants]] before Pierce is ultimately exposed. In the end, per Blindfold's prediction at the start of the series, Donald Pierce murders Wolf Cub before being captured by the group and taken into custody by the X-Men.

When the X-Men franchise is relaunched with the relocation of the X-Men to San Francisco following the events in ''Uncanny X-Men'', the characters relocate to California.<ref>''Young X-Men'' #6 (Released September 2008, Published November 2008)</ref> The series is ultimately canceled with issue #12 and many events of the series (such as Dust being mortally wounded during the team's fight with the New Mutants) would be ignored by later writers.

==''X-Men: Legacy'', ''X-Force'' and ''Wolverine and the X-Men''==

Most of the characters (most notably [[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]], who was granted full X-Men membership<ref name="NX43" />) appear sporadically following the events of ''Uncanny X-Men'' #500 and the cancellation of ''Young X-Men''. [[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]] and [[X-23]] are incorporated into the roster of a new ''[[X-Force]]'' series. The characters are ultimately given a new home in the pages of ''[[X-Men: Legacy]]'', written by [[Mike Carey (writer)|Mike Carey]] starting with ''X-Men: Legacy'' #226. Now a loose collection of students, the kids are led by [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], who serves as the team's teacher. Following the events of ''[[X-Men: Schism]]'', many of the New X-Men members follow [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] back East as he reopens the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]] as a school and sanctuary for young mutants named the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning. As of ''[[X-Men: Regenesis]]'', several additional X-Men join Rogue and Wolverine in serving as teachers for the young mutants: [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], [[Gambit (Marvel Comics)|Gambit]], [[Rachel Summers|Rachel Grey]], [[Husk (comics)|Husk]] and [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]]. The group has also accepted non-mutant members, such as [[Broo (comics)|Broo]] (a young [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] hatchling who is a pacifist) and Kid Gladiator, the son of [[X-Men]] enemy [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]]. Another member of the student body is [[Quentin Quire|Kid Omega]], whose involvement with the school is involuntary in an effort to reform him.<ref>''X-Men: Regenesis'' #1 (Released October 2011, Published December 2011)</ref>

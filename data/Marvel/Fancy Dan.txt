The '''Enforcers''' are a team of <!--Do not add "fictional" as it is tautological; supervillains (and characters in general) are by definition implied to be fictionalized to some extent.-->supervillains appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], usually as adversaries of the [[Superhero|superheroes]] [[Spider-Man]] and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]. The original Enforcers consisted of [[Montana (comics)|Montana]] (Jackson Brice), the [[Ox (comics)|Ox]] (Raymond Bloch), and Fancy Dan (Daniel Brito).

==Fictional team biography==
The Enforcers are a group of hired hitmen and extortionists, each with an expertise in a different and unique area of combat, whose goal it is to aid various employers in the takeover of New York City's criminal gangs.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=99}}</ref> In their first appearance, the Enforcers aided the [[Big Man (comics)|Big Man]] ([[Frederick Foswell]]) in his attempt to gain control of New York City's criminal gangs. They clashed with the superhero [[Spider-Man]] for the first time, and are defeated by him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=391}}</ref>

They were subsequently employed by paranoid industrialist [[Norman Osborn]], hired them to shut down Malone's Flophouse in a bid to gain the land. However, the then-amnesiac Malone resident [[Namor]] the Sub-Mariner thwarted them, later destroying Osborn's construction equipment.<ref>''Tales of the Marvels: Inner Demons''. Marvel Comics.</ref> They next aided the Green Goblin in his first unsuccessful attempt to eliminate Spider-Man, but were again defeated and jailed.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref> Soon after that, they joined forces with the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] to subdue the [[Human Torch]] at a point where it was believed Spider-Man had become a coward, but are defeated by the combined might of Spider-Man and the Human Torch.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #18-19. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Enforcers clash repeatedly with Spider-Man and occasionally other heroes such as [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]. Foswell is eventually unmasked, but later reforms and is killed. Afterward, the Ox also appears to have been killed,<ref>''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #86. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Montana and Fancy Dan team with a new [[Big Man (comics)#Janice Foswell|Big Man]], as well as with the Sandman and a new [[Crime Master]], Nick Lewis, Jr. son of the original. During a battle in which the team is defeated by Spider-Man, the Human Torch, and the [[Sons of the Tiger]], Crime Master shoots the new Big Man, learning belatedly that this "Big Man" was, in fact, a woman &mdash; Janice Foswell, daughter of the original and the younger Lewis' romantic interest.<ref>''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #39-40. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Enforcers were hired by [[Lightmaster]], who introduced a new Ox, Raymond Bloch's twin brother Ronald Bloch, to the team. The Enforcers are once again defeated by Spider-Man.<ref>''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man#Volume 1 (1976-98)|Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #19-20. Marvel Comics.</ref> They later battle the mutant superheroine the [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]].<ref>''Dazzler'' #7-8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Enforcers return with new members "Snake" Marston, a master contortionist, and "Hammer" Harrison, a [[Boxing|boxer]] who wears steel hammers over his hands. The Enforcers come under the employ of the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]], but were defeated by Spider-Man and the then-reformed Sandman.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #138. Marvel Comics.</ref> This lineup appears only once more to fight Daredevil.<ref>''Daredevil'' #356-357. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The original Ox (Raymond Bloch) returns, revived by the Kingpin.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #94-95. Marvel Comics.</ref> It is unclear whether it is Raymond or Ronald Bloch who appears with Montana and Fancy Dan in subsequent battles with Spider-Man<ref>''Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #28. Marvel Comics.</ref> and the [[She-Hulk]].<ref>''[[She-Hulk]]'' (vol. 4) #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the events known as the superhero [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], either Raymond or Ronald Bloch and "Snake" Marston are recruited into the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], a team of reformed villains.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #103-104. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, they came back together to work for [[Mister Fear]], which pitted them directly against Daredevil.{{issue|date=September 2015}} After Mister Fear's arrest, the Enforcers are taken in to work for the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s crime organization.{{issue|date=September 2015}}

Following the events of the storyline "[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day]]", the Enforcers are patrons at the [[Bar with No Name]]. They take bets with a person calling himself "the Bookie", over whether Spider-Man will show up to battle "Basher", an unknown villain who claimed to have fought Spider-Man. Spider-Man shows up, but is revealed to be Screwball in disguise when the real one shows up at the scene of the fight. The Enforcers decide to get revenge on the Bookie, capturing him. The Bookie's father calls Spider-Man for assistance and he agrees to help. Spider-Man defeats Fancy Dan and Montana and saves the Ox from being flattened by a falling roller coaster. Grateful for the save, the Ox agrees to come along quietly.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #563. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "Origin of the Species"' storyline, Spider-Man goes against the villains after [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Menace]]'s infant was stolen from him by the [[Chameleon (Marvel Comics)|Chameleon]]. The Enforcers were not actually part of this group, where they quoted "we're the Enforcers, not the Kidnappers". They got caught in the crossfire anyway when the Sandman tries to recruit them to team up with him again.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #645. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Montana then started working for the Kingpin. During a fight which resulted in the Kingpin's office crumbling, the Hobgoblin lets him fall to his death in order to take his place as Fisk's right-hand man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #648-651. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Enforcers (Fancy Dan, the Ox, "Snake" Marston and "Hammer" Harrison) are reassembled by the fourth [[Crime Master#Impostor Crime Master|Crime Master]], who convinces them and the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] to assist him with breaking [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] and [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] out of Ryker's Island. The attempted breakout is prevented by Spider-Man and the [[Wraith (Yuri Watanabe)|Wraith]] and the Crime Master is revealed to be an impostor who [[Mister Negative]] had instructed to assassinate Hammerhead and Tombstone.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Gerry Conway|penciller = Carlo Barberi|inker = Juan Vlasco|colorist = Israel Silva|letterer = Joe Caramagna|editor = Nick Lowe and Devin Lewis|story = Spiral: Part Three|title = The Amazing Spider-Man|volume = 3|issue = #18.1|date = 3 June 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Gerry Conway|penciller = Carlo Barberi|inker = Juan Vlasco|colorist = Israel Silva|letterer = Joe Caramagna|editor = Nick Lowe and Devin Lewis|story = Spiral: Part Three|title = The Amazing Spider-Man|volume = 3|issue = #19.1|date = 1 July 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

He was seen at a gathering held by the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 5) #19. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Devil's Reign]]" storyline, the Enforcers members Fancy Dan, Ox, Montana, Snake Marston, and Hammer Harrison were shown as inmates of the Myrmidon. When [[8-Ball (comics)|8-Ball]] offered to sit with them, they turn him down.<ref>''Devil's Reign: Moon Knight'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Enforcers' fate following the Skull's death remain unrevealed.<ref>''Earth X'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Marvel Noir===

* "The Ox" was re-imagined as a [[Dominican Republic#Ethnic composition|Black Dominican]] called '''Bruno Sanchez'''.

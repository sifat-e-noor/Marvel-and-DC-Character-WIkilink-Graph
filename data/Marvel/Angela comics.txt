'''Angela''' is a fictional [[superhero]] created by author [[Neil Gaiman]] and artist [[Todd McFarlane]]. She first appeared in McFarlane's creator-owned series ''[[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]]'', making her debut in issue #9 in March 1993, and later starring in her own self-titled miniseries. She is an angel and a bounty hunter, working under the auspices of Heaven to oppose Spawn.

Angela was later the subject of a legal battle between McFarlane and Gaiman over the rights to the character, which Gaiman won. Gaiman later sold the rights to the character to [[Marvel Comics]]; she was integrated into the [[Marvel Universe]] in the 2013 story "[[Age of Ultron]]",<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=19}}</ref> and her character was expanded upon in the 2014 storyline "[[Original Sin (comics)|Original Sin]]", where she was established to be '''Aldrif Odinsdottir''', the lost sister of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].

==Publication history==
===Image Comics===
In 1993 [[Todd McFarlane]] contracted [[Neil Gaiman]], along with three other recognized authors, [[Alan Moore]], [[Dave Sim]], and [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], to write one issue of his creator-owned comics series ''[[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]]'', which was published by [[Image Comics]]. While doing so, Gaiman introduced the characters Angela, [[Cogliostro]], and [[Hellspawn (Spawn)|Medieval Spawn]]. All three characters were co-created and designed by McFarlane. Angela first appeared in issue #9, as an adversary. In 1994 and 1995, a three-issue ''Angela'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] was published, written by Gaiman and illustrated by [[Greg Capullo]], in which Angela and Spawn were forced by circumstance to temporarily work together as allies. The series was later reprinted as a [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] titled ''Angela Trade Paperback'', retitled as ''Spawn: Angela's Hunt'' in later printings and given a new cover design ({{ISBN|1-887279-09-1}}).

The monthly ''Spawn'' series continued to feature all of the characters Gaiman had created long after his direct involvement had ended. Some characters had tie-ins with McFarlane's toy company, and Cogliostro had a prominent role in the live-action movie in 1997, Angela would appear in ''Spawn'' #62, #89, and #96 through #100, and in a 1995, a [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]]. She was also featured in several [[fictional crossover|crossovers]]. The ''Rage of Angels'' miniseries saw Angela meeting [[Glory (comics)|Glory]] in ''Angela and Glory'' (1996), and was continued in ''[[Youngblood (comics)|Youngblood]]'' #6 (1996) and ''[[Team Youngblood]]'' #21. There was also a crossover called ''Aria/Angela'', in which she featured in the series ''[[Aria (comics)|Aria]]''.

McFarlane had agreed that Gaiman retained creator rights to the characters, but later claimed that Gaiman's work had been work-for-hire and that McFarlane owned all of Gaiman's co-creations entirely, pointing to the legal indicia of ''Spawn'' #9 and the lack of legal contract stating otherwise. McFarlane had also refused to pay Gaiman for the volumes of Gaiman's work that McFarlane republished and kept in print. In 2002, Gaiman filed suit and won a sizable judgment against McFarlane and Image Comics for the rights due any creator.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/spawn-comic-book-todd-mcfarlane-neil-gaiman-286071/|title=Decades-Long Legal Feud over 'Spawn' Comic Book Finally Ends|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://casetext.com/case/gaiman-v-mcfarlane-2|title = Gaiman v.

===Marvel Comics===
[[Comic Book Resources]] confirmed on March 21, 2013, that Neil Gaiman was returning to [[Marvel Comics]] and would bring Angela with him. [[Joe Quesada]] was quoted as saying her first appearance as a proper Marvel character would happen at the finale of the "[[Age of Ultron]]" storyline.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/gaiman-returns-to-marvel-brings-spawns-angela/|title=Gaiman Returns to Marvel, Brings ''Spawn's'' Angela|first=Steve|last=Sunu|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=March 21, 2013|access-date=April 20, 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190420031704/https://www.cbr.com/gaiman-returns-to-marvel-brings-spawns-angela/|archive-date=April 20, 2019|quote=Later this year, writer Neil Gaiman makes his return to Marvel Comics...Perhaps even more intriguing is the announcement that Gaiman plans to introduce Angela to the Marvel U. }}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===Image Comics history===
[[File:Angela hunter.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Greg Capullo]]'s rendition of Angela in one of her appearances in Image Comics.]]
Angela is an angel and a bounty hunter, working under the auspices of Heaven to oppose Spawn. She attempted to kill Spawn upon their first meeting, but was defeated despite her significantly greater experience.<ref>''Spawn'' #9 (March 1993)</ref> Later, he came to her aid during her trial in Heaven, where he testified that she had permission to kill him. They were temporarily trapped in a pocket dimension when Spawn's cloak acted to protect him from her weapons. Spawn's restructuring of reality allowed them to return from the pocket dimension, and also erased Angela's 'permit' to use her weapons against him.<ref>''Angela'' #1-3 (December 1994-February 1995)</ref> While returning to Earth they started a romantic relationship. However, Angela was killed during the battle with [[Malebolgia]]. Spawn returned her body to the angels, who presumably brought her back to life.<ref>''Spawn'' #100 (November 2000)</ref>

===Marvel Comics history===
During the 2013 "[[Age of Ultron]]" storyline, Angela is revealed to be alive and has been pulled from Heaven <!-- This is not a misspelling; it is the canon spelling. --> as a result of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]'s damage to the Omniverse.<ref>''Age of Ultron'' #10. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> In a combination of rage and confusion, she charges towards Earth from outer space, only to be intercepted by the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], leading to her joining the team.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 3 #5. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

During the ''[[Original Sin (comics)|Original Sin]]'' storyline, it is revealed that she is Aldrif, the daughter of [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] and Freyja, making her sister to [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]]. She was "killed" as an infant during Asgard's war with the Angels of the Tenth Realm called "Heven." This crime resulted in Odin severing the Tenth Realm from the other nine as punishment for their attack. Thor learns of his sister's existence when he is exposed to the secrets of [[Uatu]], the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]]'s eye, by the [[Orb (comics)|Orb]]. He returns to Asgard to confront his mother about his sister's existence, and subsequently travels to the Tenth Realm with Loki to learn more about his sister.<ref>''Original Sin'' #5.1. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

The Guardians of the Galaxy and Angela are attacked in warp space by a band of pirates, called Warpjackers. During the battle, Angela abandons the Guardians when the adult Loki telepathically tells her that the portal to Heven is open and that she can return home. As Thor battles Heven's guards, Angela appears having been guided to the doorway to Heven by Loki, and prepares to battle Thor.<ref>''Original Sin'' #5.2. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> Angela fights an exhausted Thor who had just fought off the army of Heven, and is then told by the Queen of Angels to bring Thor to her. The now-female Loki has aligned with the Angels, telling Thor that "being on the winning side seems just perfect."<ref>''Original Sin'' #5.3. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

While Loki leads an Angel fleet to Asgard, under the false pretence to help them destroy it, Thor escapes captivity and engages Angela in combat once again.<ref>''Original Sin'' #5.4</ref> The fight between Thor and Angela is interrupted when Odin (who Loki freed from his self-exile) arrives and recognizes Angela as his daughter, revealing Angela's true lineage as the long thought dead Aldrif. A long time ago, the Angel tasked to dispose of Aldrif's body found out the baby was alive and raised her as one of the Angels under the name of Angela. In light of this revelation, the Queen of Angels grants Angela her life, pardoning her for her service to the Angels, but exiles her from Heven due to her lineage. After leaving Heven, Odin tells Thor, Loki, and Angela that he still loves his children. Angela then decides to leave in order to explore the other realms.<ref>''Original Sin'' #5.5. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

Later, Angela and her lover Sera abduct the newborn daughter of Odin and Freyja. Unbeknownst to Odin, the baby is possessed by the spirit of [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]] and Odin orders Thor to hunt down the pair. Angela and Sera with help from the Guardians of the Galaxy, stay ahead of Thor and take the baby to Heven to be cleansed of Surtur's spirit. There, Angela throws the baby into the stalled engines of Heven. Surtur's fire is expelled from the baby and reignites the engines of Heven. For this action, Angela's debt to Heven is repaid and thus closes her last remaining connection to the realm.<ref>''Angela: Asgard's Assassin'' #1-6. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

After Angela returns the baby to Odin, she discovers that Sera is actually [[Malekith the Accursed]] and the real Sera, who was previously killed in battle, remains in [[Hel (location)|Hel]]. Angela travels to Hel and petitions [[Hela (comics)|Hela]] to restore her love to life. When Hela refuses, Angela launches a campaign of conquest with the help of Sera and Hela's handmaiden, Leah, completing several trials to become the new Queen of Hel. When she succeeds, she frees the souls of the dead Angels enslaved by Hel, and restores Sera to life, only to abdicate and return to Earth with Sera and Leah, having no need for power.<ref>''Angela: Queen of Hel'' #1-5. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

Angela later joins [[Strikeforce (comics)|Strikeforce]], an Avengers-adjacent black ops team as the co-leader alongside [[Blade (comics)|Blade]].<ref>''Strikeforce'' #1-9. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
In her current Marvel incarnation, Angela is a born god and heir to the Asgardian throne.<ref>''[[Original Sin (comics)|Original Sin]]'' #5.1. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> She has enormous amounts of super strength which enables her to fight opponents like Jane Foster (Thor),<ref>''Angela: Queen of Hel'' #6.

==== ''Angela: Asgard's Assassin'' ====
According to [[Diamond Comic Distributors]], ''Angela: Asgard's Assassin'' #1 was the 15th best selling comic book in December 2014.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Top 100 Comics: December 2014 |url=http://www.diamondcomics.com/Article/159010-Top-100-Comics-December-2014 |access-date=2022-10-07 |website=www.diamondcomics.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Comichron: December 2014 Comic Book Sales to Comics Shops |url=https://www.comichron.com/monthlycomicssales/2014/2014-12.html |access-date=2022-10-07 |website=www.comichron.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Top 300 Comics Actual--December 2014 |url=https://icv2.com/articles/news/view/30647/top-300-comics-actual-december-2014 |access-date=2022-10-07 |website=icv2.com |language=en}}</ref> ''Angela: Asgard's Assassin'' #1 was the 217th best selling comic book in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Comichron: 2014 Comic Book Sales to Comics Shops |url=https://www.comichron.com/monthlycomicssales/2014.html |access-date=2022-10-07 |website=www.comichron.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Top 1000 Comics--2014 |url=https://icv2.com/articles/markets/view/30621/top-1000-comics-2014 |access-date=2022-10-07 |website=icv2.com |language=en}}</ref>

Doug Zawisza of ''[[CBR.com]]'' called ''Angela: Asgard's Assassin'' #1 "one of the most technically stunning debut issues from Marvel," writing, "Stephanie Hans' work is atmospheric and painterly, providing a distinct visual difference from Jimenez's but maintaining the same level of detail and dedication to addressing Angela as a figure flowing through the panels rather than a sex symbol posing in those panels. Hans adds rugged torn edges to the panels, giving them the appearance of being ripped from Sera's or Angela's memories. Just as subtly as "Angela: Asgard's Assassin" #1 shifts from main story to substory, it shifts back out, bringing readers to a conclusion fraught with anticipation. Any comic with "Asgard" in the title is destined to bring in the God of Thunder, but with Thor now being a different Thor than the one Angela is familiar with, Gillen elects to leave readers awaiting the confrontation between Angela and Odinson. To sweeten the pot, the writer teases a surprising reason for the visit, leaving readers with a cliffhanger in the process. It's a solid cap to a solid comic book, as "Angela: Asgard's Assassin" #1 gives readers yet another excellent female-led series in the Marvel Universe."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Zawisza |first=Doug |date=2014-12-04 |title=Angela: Asgard's Assassin #1 |url=https://www.cbr.com/angela-asgards-assassin-1/ |access-date=2022-10-07 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> Petra Halbur of ''[[The Mary Sue]]'' described ''Angela: Asgard's Assassin'' #1 as potentially "the best new series in recent memory," asserting, "There’s plenty to appreciate about Angela: Asgard’s Assassin #1aside from the heroine’s principles, of course. Awesomely, Stephanie Hans’ illustrations provide little to no fodder for The Hawkeye Initiative. Despite her ridiculously skimpy armor, Angela remains generally un-sexualized by the artist, striking no poses that draw especial attention to her breasts, legs or butt. I also love Sera’s design, a woman, er, angel of color who rocks her celestial armor with a short, plump frame (by comic book standards, anyways). Still, it’s this code of justice that really sets Angela apart from other seemingly morally complex antiheroes and opens her up to some interesting possibilities. I can’t imagine Thor and Angela will remain adversaries for very long and I dearly look forward to a team up between the honorable God of Thunder, his “balance” obsessed sister and the newly-minted Agent of Axis, Loki: three siblings with fundamentally clashing codes of conduct."<ref>{{Cite web |date=2014-12-07 |title=Review: Angela: Asgard's Assassin #1 |url=https://www.themarysue.com/review-marvel-comics-angela-asgards-assassin-1/ |access-date=2022-10-07 |website=The Mary Sue |language=en}}</ref>

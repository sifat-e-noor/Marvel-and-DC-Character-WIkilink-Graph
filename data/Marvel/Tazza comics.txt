{{For|the DC Comics character|Talon (DC Comics)}}
Talon is depicted as a feline [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] in the [[Earth-691]] timeline of the fictional [[Marvel Universe]], sorcerer apprentice to Krugarr.  Talon debuted in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' #18 (November 1991).  He is a member of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]].  Initially, creator Jim Valentino wanted to use [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] in a storyline where the Guardians had briefly returned to Earth, but [[Bob Harras]], the [[X-Men]] editor of the time, did not want it established that Wolverine could live that long.  Thus, Valentino created Talon, influenced by [[Steve Englehart]]'s take on the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] during Beast's "party hearty" time with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.imagecomics.com/messageboard/viewtopic.php?t=144&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=15&sid=b15a56f754d4ebc6f50fd8e6c4c8a603 |title=IMAGE COMICS COMMUNITY - Jim Valentino's Guardians Thread |publisher=Imagecomics.com |access-date=2011-04-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516161522/http://www.imagecomics.com/messageboard/viewtopic.php?t=144&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=15&sid=fd50fa9bc46f3072e79db765589e9e5a |archive-date=2011-05-16 }}</ref> Valentino later stated that Talon "wasn't gay, as some people thought. I thought it would lighten things up to have a happy-go-lucky screw-up on the team since, when looked at properly, the Guardians were not a superhero team, but rather a light army."<ref>{{cite journal | last=Buttery| first=Jarrod |title=Explore the Marvel Universe of the 31st Century with... the Guardians of the Galaxy| journal=[[Back Issue!]] |issue=65 |page=30| publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]| date=July 2013| location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref>

Talon has some superhuman abilities thanks to his genetically superior Inhuman physiology, and has possibly been exposed to the mutagenic [[Terrigen Mist]]. He has a feline form: an orange fur-covered body, razor-sharp talons on his hands and feet, pointed ears, pronounced canine teeth, and a 3{{frac|1|2}}' prehensile tail. He has superhuman strength, is an Olympic-level acrobat and gymnast, and is a highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant. The talons on his hands and feet can be detached and hurled as weapons, then regrow instantly.

==Orwell Taylor==
General '''Orwell Taylor''' is a character in [[Marvel Comics]]. The character, created by [[David Michelinie]] and [[Mark Bagley]], first appeared in ''Venom: Lethal Protector'' #1 (February 1993). He is the founder of [[The Jury (comics)|The Jury]].

The father of Maxwell (Max) Taylor and Hugh Taylor, his oldest son was a guard at a [[Vault (Marvel Comics)|prison for super powered criminals]] who was murdered during Venom's escape.{{issue|date=December 2012}} Orwell recruited a number of Hugh's co-workers ([[Curtis Elkins|Sentry]], [[Firearm (Marvel Comics)|Firearm]], [[Bomblast]]) as well as [[Ramshot]] (Samuel Culkin) and his youngest son as [[Screech (comics)|Screech]]. Orwell outfitted his group with altered Guardsman armors to hunt [[Eddie Brock]].{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Although the Jury failed against Venom, Orwell devised a way to kidnap [[Spider-Man]] to be put on trial for bringing the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote to Earth. The Jury and Orwell are again met with defeat.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Orwell later began a business relationship with the [[Life Foundation]] with The Jury now glorified bodyguards for people in the organization's bunkers. Orwell soon became paranoid that his men were out to usurp his authority. Orwell slowly began to show that his hate and desire for revenge had twisted him and he had no regard left for anyone but himself.{{issue|date=December 2012}} A shareholder of the Life Foundation, he and [[Roland Treece]] were arrested by federal agents for their part in [[Carlton Drake]]'s Arachnis Project; the Jury parted from Taylor and redefined their modus operandi.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Orwell most often clashed with his younger son due to Orwell's methods. He also routinely clashed with Ramshot whose conscience kept interfering with Orwell's way of running the Jury. Maxwell abandoned the Screech identity to serve as a defense attorney for the Jury's victims, and [[Wysper]] took his son's place. Screech apparently has severed all ties with the Jury just like his father, and was not on the Jury when the group reformed by the [[U.S. Agent (comics)|U.S. Agent]] and [[Edwin Cord]].{{issue|date=December 2012}}

'''Temugin''' is the son of the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]]. Created by [[Ryan Odagawa]] and [[Mike Grell]], he first appeared in ''[[Iron Man (comic book)|Iron Man]]'' vol. 3 #53 (June 2002).<ref name="The Marvel Encyclopedia">{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=371}}</ref> The character is named after [[Genghis Khan]], his in-universe ancestor.

As an infant, Temugin was delivered to a monastery in the Himalayas by his father. Confident the monks would educate the boy, the Mandarin cut off almost all communication with his son, which left Temugin with abandonment issues.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 3 #68-69</ref>

He appears in the miniseries ''[[Iron Man: Enter the Mandarin]]'', where the Mandarin uses his mind control ring to force Temugin to kill Tony Stark. Temugin later shoots Stark in the chest, and deduces that the man's secret when the suit's chestplate stops the bullet. Temugin escapes and returns to the monastery, and a disappointed Mandarin wipes his mind of the incident.<ref>''Iron Man: Enter the Mandarin'' #1-3</ref>

After the Mandarin's death in a battle against [[Iron Man]], Temugin receives his [[Mandarin's rings|father's 10 rings of power]] and discovers that, for honor's sake, he must kill Iron Man so his father's spirit can find peace.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 3 #89</ref> Luring Iron Man to his father's fortress, Temugin proves more than a match for Iron Man's mechanically enhanced strength. Before he could kill the hero, another enemy of the Mandarin attacks and the fortress erupts into flames.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Temugin later appears in ''MODOK's 11'' #4, wherein he has been contacted by the double-crossing Spot, who promptly hands over the weapon that [[MODOK]] had been planning to steal. In this appearance, Temugin speaks of the Mandarin as "my late father" and bears the rings, one of which he uses to imprison [[Spot (comics)|Spot]] in another dimension with nothing but money.<ref>''MODOK's 11'' #4</ref> In the following issue, the [[Puma (comics)|Puma]] tears off at least one of his hands. However, it is possible that he retained at least half of the rings, as [[Nightshade (Marvel Comics)|Nightshade]] who used the rings on his lost hand, was not seen with them at the end of the story.<ref>''MODOK's 11'' #5</ref>

However, much later he is seen among the ''[[Agents of Atlas]]'', appointed as a second in command, and possible replacement, for [[Jimmy Woo]], current head figure for the ''Atlas Foundation''. Now sporting a bulky prosthetic, he initially comes into conflict with Jimmy Woo over what he perceives as cowardly behavior and pointlessly complicated planning on Woo's part. The two gradually become friends over the course of several battles, most notably versus Jade Claw.<ref>''Agents of Atlas'' #1-13</ref>

[[Sasha Hammer]] is his paternal half-sister.

'''Thane''' is the illegitimate child of [[Thanos]] and an unnamed [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] woman. He was created by [[Jonathan Hickman]] and [[Mike Deodato]] and first appeared in ''New Avengers'' vol. 3 #10.

During the ''[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]'' storyline, Thanos begins invading [[Attilan]] in an attempt to find and kill his son. Upon undergoing Terrigenesis, Thane develops powers of instant death to those near him and the ability to encase others in amber, but he cannot control these powers and inadvertently kills everyone in his hometown. He is given a special suit by [[Ebony Maw]] that allows him to properly control and channel his powers, and he begins to rebel against his father. Thane is easily manipulated, having been used by villains such as [[J'son (comics)|J'son]] and [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] in pursuit of their own goals. He is briefly empowered by both [[The Black Vortex]] and the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]], but is later stripped of all his powers and trapped by Thanos in the God Quarry.

; In other media
* Thane has appeared in ''[[Marvel Avengers Academy]]''.
* Thane appears in ''[[Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order]]'', voiced by [[Robbie Daymond]]. He started out as an ally prior to unwillingly assisting his father in searching for the [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Stones]], first appearing at Attilan before joining the heroes, then becoming the final boss when the Infinity Stones completely corrupt him. Thane gives himself and the Infinity Stones over to the Black Order to ensure the heroes' safety. However, the Black Order has an idea by sending the heroes to be doomed by Hela and Surtur before waging war with Nova Corps at Knowhere. The heroes and the Black Order prepare to clash, but are stopped by Thane using the Time Stone. Thane wanted both heroes and Black Order allied together alongside him to defeat Thanos, but Thane is distracted trying to choose a side, and remembering Captain America's word that he is not like Thanos. Thanos attacks Thane from behind and confirms to his son that he won't be like him, thus places the Stones in his Infinity Gauntlet, transporting everyone to his throne for a final battle. By the time the heroes defeated Thanos, Thane, now completely corrupted by the Infinity Stones' influence takes the Infinity Gauntlet from him, and uses the stones’ power to don the full armored Infinity Armor while planning to kill his father to prove his superiority and the heroes if they stand in his way. Thane brought the heroes and Thanos with him into the Heart of Infinity, where the Infinity Stones were forged at the center of the universe. The heroes aid Thanos in stopping the out-of-control Thane. Thanos confirms that the power of the Infinity Armor is too great for any mortal being, even Thanos himself, the heroes beg Thanos to save him and Thanos eventually acknowledges Thane as his son and proceeds to pull the Infinity Gauntlet from Thane's hand, causing the two to disappear and leaving the heroes and the Infinity Stones behind upon returning to Thanos’ throne. Unfortunately, the final suicidal clash between him and Thanos somehow awakened a dangerous entity that will invade the universe, alerting both [[Doctor Doom]] and [[Fantastic Four]]'s [[Mister Fantastic]], causing the alliance band back together with Doom and the Fantastic Four on their side.

'''Thorn''' ('''Salvatore "Sal" Carbone''') is a [[character (arts)|fictional character]], primarily an enemy of the [[Punisher]], created by writer [[Chuck Dixon]] and artist [[John Romita Jr.]] The character first appeared in [[The Punisher War Zone (1992 series)|''The Punisher War Zone'']] #1 (March 1992).

Wanting to eliminate the Carbones, a [[crime family]] situated in [[Brooklyn]], the [[Punisher]] infiltrated the group with the aid of a petty criminal named [[Mickey Fondozzi]]. The Carbones were led by [[Julius Carbone|Julius]], whose second in-command was his brother, Salvatore.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Chuck Dixon|penciller = John Romita, Jr.|inker = Klaus Janson|colorist = Gregory Wright|letterer = Jim Novak|editor = Don Daley|story = Only the Dead Know Brooklyn|title = The Punisher War Zone|volume = 1|issue = #1|date = March 1992|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> While Julius welcomed Mickey and the Punisher (who had adopted the alias "Johnny Tower") into the organization, Sal disliked the two, and was suspicious of their motives, correctly assuming that they were sabotaging the Carbones' operations.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Chuck Dixon|penciller = John Romita, Jr.|inker = Klaus Janson|colorist = Gregory Wright|letterer = Jim Novak|editor = Don Daley|story = Blood in the Water|title = The Punisher War Zone|volume = |issue = #2|date = April 1992|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

Needing leverage to get Sal off of their backs, Mickey and the Punisher spied on him, and discovered that he was consorting with rival Asian gangsters. Enraged by Sal's treachery, Julius ordered Mickey and the Punisher to dispose of him, so the two drugged Sal and drove him out to [[New Jersey]]. Due to his frequent [[narcotic]]s usage, Sal was able to resist the drugs he was given and tried to flee, but fell through the ice of a frozen lake. Believing Sal to have perished, Mickey and the Punisher left.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Chuck Dixon|penciller = John Romita, Jr.|inker = Klaus Janson|colorist = Gregory Wright|letterer = Jim Novak|editor = Don Daley|story = The Frame|title = The Punisher War Zone|volume = 1|issue = #3|date = May 1992|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

Sal survived, and regained consciousness in a hospital, which he escaped from.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Chuck Dixon|penciller = John Romita, Jr.|inker = Klaus Janson|colorist = Gregory Wright|letterer = Jim Novak|editor = Don Daley|story = Closer to the Flame|title = The Punisher War Zone|volume = |issue = #4|date = June 1992|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> Recalling nothing about his past other than vague details about the people who had tried to kill him, Sal robbed and murdered a man, and began making his way to La Isla de Tiburones Durmientes, which was where Julius's daughter was about to marry a [[Sicily|Sicilian]] mobster. When a motorist he had flagged down asked him what his name was, Sal, unable to remember, replied with Thorn, a word he had glimpsed on a [[billboard]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Chuck Dixon|penciller = John Romita, Jr.|inker = Klaus Janson|colorist = Gregory Wright|letterer = Jim Novak|editor = Don Daley|story = Feeding Frenzy|title = The Punisher War Zone|volume = |issue = #5|date = July 1992|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

After swimming to La Isla de Tiburones Durmientes, Thorn ran amok, killing his niece's fiancé and Julius, among others. The Punisher put a stop to Thorn's rampage by shooting him repeatedly, and knocking him into the ocean.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Chuck Dixon|penciller = John Romita, Jr.|inker = Klaus Janson|colorist = Gregory Wright|letterer = Jim Novak|editor = Don Daley|story = The Carrion Eaters|title = The Punisher War Zone|volume = |issue = #6|date = August 1992|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author = Robert G.

Thorn found and attacked Mickey and the Punisher, but the fight was interrupted by the boss of the dealers Thorn had killed. After massacring the head dealer and his underlings, Thorn and the Punisher continued their brawl, which ended when the Punisher threw Thorn off of a bridge, and onto a moving truck. The truck brought Thorn to New Jersey, and he was last seen wandering [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Chuck Dixon|penciller = Dale Eaglesham|inker = Al Williamson|colorist = Christie Scheele|letterer = Bill Oakley|editor = Don Daley|story = Hurt So Good|title = The Punisher War Zone Annual|volume = |issue = #2|date = September 1994|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

For unexplained reasons, nearly dying in a frigid lake has left Thorn unable to feel pain, allowing him to sustain severe injuries, such as multiple gunshots, without being deterred. Thorn's brush with death has also eliminated his need for basic human necessities such as food, water, air, and protection from the elements, and made him repellent towards animals such as sharks.

In a 2009 interview with [[Comic Book Resources]], illustrator [[Dale Eaglesham]] expressed fondness for the character, stating "I spent some time in the Punisher department from 93 to 95 and I really enjoyed working with Frank Castle. However, there's another Punisher-related character that I feel I have unfinished business with: Sal Carbone, the man they call Thorn. He went toe-to-toe with Castle and survived because he thinks he's already dead. He's insane, and he would actually make a great Punisher! Maybe I can talk [[Ed Brubaker]] into that one; I think he would love it".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19910|title = NYCC: Eaglesham on his Marvel Exclusive Deal|last = Richards|first = Dave|publisher = [[Comic Book Resources]]|date = 7 February 2009|website = comicbookresources.com|access-date = 10 February 2015}}</ref>

When Garm and Hel-Wolf were left together by [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Kid Loki]], they conceived seven Hel pups, with one of them being Thori. While his siblings had inherited their mother's loyal nature, Thori on the other hand had inherited his father's vicious nature. Garm gave the pups to Loki as a gift, since she didn't have time to raise them. However, the All-Mothers, consisting of [[Freyja (comics)|Freyja]], Gaea and [[Idunn (comics)|Idunn]], order Loki to find another home for the pups, so Loki along with Leah left six of the pups with [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], Gaea, [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]], the [[New Mutants]], [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]], [[Tyr (Marvel Comics)|Tyr]] and an Earth animal shelter, leaving Thori the last one. Loki was unable to find a home for the pup, so the All-Mothers ordered him to destroy the pup, since he was beyond salvation. But Loki seeing a bit of himself in the pup, decided to keep him as his pet and named him Thori after his brother [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #632. Marvel Comics</ref>
When [[Daimon Hellstrom]] had joined Loki to battle [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]], Thori immediately grew fond of Daimon and asked him to be his new master.<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #634.

After the events of ''Everything Burns'' storyline, where the Aesir battled the Vanir, Thori remained with his father.<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #644-645. Marvel Comics</ref>

When [[Angela (comics)|Angela]] came to Hel in order to get the soul her love, Sera, and control of Hel, Thori aided [[Hela (comics)|Hela]], Hel-Wolf and the Disir in the battle, however, he got trapped by Sera.

Tiboro has become a minor nemesis of [[Doctor Strange]] in modern times. Tiboro uses an artifact called the Screaming Idol to communicate with creatures on Earth while he is in his own dimension.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #178</ref>

During the "[[Death of Doctor Strange]]" storyline, Tiboro has claimed his ancient territory in Peru. [[Clea]] later mentioned to Classic Doctor Strange and those present that Tiboro and the other inter-dimensional warlords are fleeing from the Three Mothers.<ref>''Death of Doctor Strange'' #2</ref>

==Tick-Tock==
'''Tick-Tock''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] created by [[Ann Nocenti]] and [[Brian Postman]]. He first appeared in ''Spider-Woman #50'', where he helps the Locksmith capture and imprison various [[San Francisco]]-based superheroes and supervillains, including [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]].<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #47-49</ref> He uses his precognitive abilities to help prevent break-outs, anticipating the prisoners' attempts before they could happen, but does not foresee that when Spider-Woman breaks out, she would change costumes with the [[Skein (comics)|Gypsy Moth]]. Placing the two women in each other's cells, Spider-Woman is able to escape and free the others, and the Locksmith and Tick-Tock were sent to prison.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #50</ref>

Tick-Tock later joins the [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]]'s [[Night Shift (comics)|Night Shift]], and assisted in their assault upon the Power Broker alongside [[Captain America]] (pretending to be hypnotized by Dansen Macabre). Tick-Tock was instrumental in getting them past the guards at the gate by predicting their movements. Tick-Tock helped Captain America and the Shroud guard the prisoners they took inside the Power Broker's mansion, and ultimately escaped with the Night Shift, evading the authorities.<ref name="Captain America #330-331"/>

Later, Tick-Tock joined the Night Shift to observe the [[Moon Knight]]'s battle with the Shroud, as the Shroud tested him to serve as his replacement in the Night Shift.<ref name="Solo Avengers #3"/>

After Digger was arrested by the [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]], Tick-Tock joined the Night Shift in attacking the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] Compound, unaware that the Mockingbird was no longer an Avenger. Tick-Tock helped the [[Brothers Grimm (comics)|Brothers Grimm]] defeat the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] by predicting when he would become solid, but the team was finally defeated by the Avengers. They were then rescued by the Shroud.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #40</ref>

When the [[Hangman (Marvel Comics)#Jason Roland|Hangman]] assumed control of the Night Shift, he encouraged each member to join him in a campaign of terror against Hollywood, pointing to their backgrounds for reasons why they should hate [[Hollywood (film industry)|Hollywood]]. He noted that Tick-Tock had wanted to be a timer in an animation studio once. Tick-Tock joined the Night Shift in receiving new power from [[Satannish]], but lost a portion of their souls as a result. He accompanied the Night Shift as they captured [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]], [[Julia Carpenter|the second Spider-Woman]], and the [[U.S. Agent (comics)|U.S. Agent]], then attempted to offer their souls to Satannish.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #76</ref> [[Iron Man]] and the [[Living Lightning]] followed Digger to the Tower of Shadows, and saved their teammates from the Night Shift. Tick-Tock attempted to defeat them with his new powers, slowing the Avengers down, but Spider-Woman was outside his path, and knocked him out from behind. They were teleported away from the Avengers by Dansen Macabre. Tick-Tock then joined the Night Shift in an attack on [[Wonder Man]], but found that Wonder Man was immune to his powers, possibly because of his ionic energies. After capturing Wonder Man, they were convinced by him to allow him to join them in their campaign against Hollywood by making their own film.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #77</ref>

When the U.S. Agent assumed the part Wonder Man had been playing in "The Demon That Devoured Hollywood", the Night Shift attacked him, and Tick-Tock slowed him down long enough for the [[Misfit (Marvel Comics)|Misfit]], Digger and the Hangman to knock him out. Realizing that Wonder Man intended to betray them, they also brought Wonder Man down.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #78</ref> As the Night Shift continued with their film project, the Avengers attacked them, all on film. The Night Shift nearly defeated them, but then learned from Dr. Strange that they had lost part of their souls to Satannish. They then turned on the Hangman, and helped the Avengers and [[Doctor Strange]] drive Satannish back to his own realm.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #79</ref>

Tick-Tock was with the Night Shift at the time when they are hired by the crime lord Snapdragon on [[Count Nefaria]]'s behalf to capture Moon Knight.<ref>''Moon Knight'' vol. 7 #3</ref> When the Moon Knight refused Tick-Tock's offer to accompany them, the Night Shift attacked, where Tick-Tock accidentally hit the Tatterdemalion when trying to shoot [[Echo (Marvel Comics)|Maya Lopez]]. After Echo knocked out Digger, she used a shovel to stab Tick-Tock. Moon Knight and Echo defeated the Night Shift, who are then arrested by the police.<ref>''Moon Knight'' vol. 7 #4</ref> As Tick-Tock was being interrogated by the LAPD's Detective Hall, Count Nefaria's lawyer showed up and ended the interrogation. After Count Nefaria's lawyer states that the Night Shift are victims of a beating from vigilantes, the Night Shift are released from police custody.<ref>''Moon Knight'' vol. 7 #5</ref> When Tick-Tock and the rest of the Night Shift are brought before Snapdragon and Count Nefaria, the two of them wanted to discuss with them why they failed their mission, where Count Nefaria insulted them for their incompetence. Before the Night Shift could answer, Count Nefaria used his ionic energy blasts to incinerate them, as he tells Snapdragon to aim a little higher the next time she asks for outside help.<ref>''Moon Knight'' vol. 7 #6</ref>

Tick-Tock can perceive various possible futures diverging within the next 60 seconds. The sharper his focus on a particular future event, the more likely it is to occur. He uses a pocket watch to focus his power.

After being empowered by Satannish, Tick-Tock could also control the flow of time, causing others to freeze in place, while he and his associates moved normally.{{issue|date=September 2017}}

Following the orders of their emperor, the Guard clashed with the X-Men on a nameless Shi'ar Empire planet, and were on the verge of winning when the band of interstellar freebooters known as the [[Starjammers]] arrived to turn the tide of battle in the X-Men's favor.<ref>''X-Men'' #107 (October 1977).</ref>

Some time later, when [[Deathbird]] was empress, Titan joined the other Imperial Guard members in battle against [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] and the Starjammers. Titan fought [[Captain Britain]].<ref>''X-Men Spotlight On: Starjammers'' #2</ref> Later, on Deathbird's behalf, Titan assisted the other Imperial Guardsmen in battle against the X-Men and Starjammers, but was defeated by them.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #274-277 (March–June 1991).</ref>

Later, after Lilandra became leader of the Shi'ar Empire, Titan was amongst a small group of Imperial Guard that defended their Empress Lilandra against the [[Kree]] super-team known as Starforce, during the war between the Shi'ar and [[Kree]] Empires.  Titan battled the [[Supremor]] android.<ref>''Thor'' #446 (April 1992).</ref> Titan also joined in the Imperial Guard's battle with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] on the Shi'ar throne world of Chandilar during the Kree-Shi'ar War, but was defeated by the [[Scarlet Witch]].<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #82 (May 1992).</ref>

[[Ronan the Accuser]] subsequently led the Kree in a surprise attack against the Shi'ar, using the [[Inhumans]] as an army to disrupt the Shi'ar control of the Kree. Appearing over the city of [[Attilan]], Ronan seized control in a surprise attack and forces the Inhumans and their king, [[Black Bolt]], to obey, or he would destroy their only home and everyone in it. He compelled [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]], [[Gorgon (Inhuman)|Gorgon]], and [[Triton (comics)|Triton]] to covertly join the Imperial Guard, while Black Bolt and [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] attempted the assassination of the Shi'ar ruler Lilandra at a ceremony ratifying an alliance between the Shi'ar and the [[List of alien races in Marvel Comics#S|Spartoi]].

In the battle against [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]], Titan seemed to have been killed,<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #480 (January 2007).</ref> but was actually only seriously wounded and later reappears.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Inhumans'' #3–4 (December 2008–January 2009).</ref>

The "[[Realm of Kings]]" crossover series sees the Shi'ar team up with the Starjammers to investigate "The Fault," a space-time anomaly that not only threatens Shi'ar space, but all of reality. This crisis leads to Titan's actual death (along with [[Starbolt]], Black Light, and [[Neutron (Marvel Comics)|Neutron]]).<ref>''Realm of Kings: Imperial Guard'' #5 (May 2010).</ref>

==Tom Thumb==
'''Tom Thumb''' ('''Thomas Thompson''') is a member of the superhero team the [[Squadron Supreme]]. Created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[John Buscema]], he first appeared in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #85 (February 1971). He is a [[dwarfism|dwarf]] scientist and inventor. He designed the Squadron's headquarters{{Issue|date=January 2019}} and frequently created advanced devices such as a Behavior Modifying Machine that could be used on criminals to change their ways, and a [[Force field (science fiction)|force field]] belt that protected its wearer.{{Issue|date=January 2019}}

The character first appears when several members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] end up in the Squadron Supreme's universe and battle them.<ref>''The Avengers'' #85–86</ref> The Squadron later are manipulated by the [[Serpent Crown|Serpent Cartel]], and the team travels to the mainstream Marvel Universe to extend the Cartel's power. They battle the Avengers once more, returning to their own universe in the process, but eventually realize that the Cartel is evil and renounce them.<ref>''The Avengers'' #148–149</ref>

Alongside the other Squadron members, Thumb is mind-controlled by the [[Overmind (comics)|Over-Mind]] and is used in the entity's conquest of the Squadron's Earth. The team is freed by the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], and together they battle and defeat the Over-Mind and Null, the Living Darkness.<ref>''The Defenders'' #112–114</ref>

To help restore the world after the chaos brought upon it by the Over-Mind's conquest, the Squadron resolves to take control of the planet, and the members reveal their secret identities to the world. Fellow Squadron member [[Nuke (Squadron Supreme)|Nuke]] asks Thumb to find a cure for his parents' cancer, but Tom Thumb fails. Thumb discovers that he has also developed terminal [[cancer]].<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #2</ref> Tom Thumb then completed the Behavior Modification Machine.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #3</ref> He was captured by the [[Institute of Evil]], and voted to expel the [[Golden Archer]] from the Squadron.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #5–6</ref> Tom Thumb travels to the future to steal a universal cure for disease, but he discovers it is ineffective to cure his cancer. Thumb ultimately dies at the team's headquarters in Squadron City and was placed in the Hibernaculum, a form of [[suspended animation]] that he invented to preserve the bodies of diseased or recently deceased persons until a remedy could be found for them.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #9–10</ref>

Tom Thumb has an extraordinary genius level of intellect, but no superhuman powers. He is an expert and innovator in a wide range of scientific and technological fields, including computer science, medicine, psychology, force field technology, and spacecraft design. He possesses [[total recall (memory)|total recall]] and great physical dexterity. He is highly skilled at manipulating various weaponry of his own design. He possesses doctorate degrees in mathematics, physics, and electrical engineering. Tom Thumb has access to a variety of technologies that he has designed. He used a one-man flying vehicle that was equipped with various advanced weaponry, including guns firing concussive energy blasts. His inventions included [[AIDA (comics)|A.I.D.A.]] (Artificially Intelligent Data Analyzer), a highly advanced computer with a human-like personality and sentience; the Behavior Modification Machine, which could alter the personalities and thinking processes of human powers; the Hibernaculum, a means of storing a human body in suspended animation; and the Transtemporal Somnaprojector, a means of time travel. He also invented and wore a personal force field belt, which projected a protective field of energy about the wearer that could even deflect bullets.

===Supreme Power versions===
In ''[[Supreme Power]]'', Tom Thumb is one of a number of convicts who volunteered to act as [[Human subject research|test subjects]] for a military experiment, which caused him to shrink to less than one inch high.{{Issue|date=January 2019}} He joins the government's Squadron Supreme program, and he enters counseling to deal with the trauma of being trapped in a capsule during one mission.{{Issue|date=January 2019}} This version of the character apparently died along with the rest of his universe when it collided with another reality.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 5 #4</ref>

===Heroes Reborn version===
In the 2021 "[[Heroes Reborn (2021 comic)|Heroes Reborn]]" reality, Tom Thumb is a member of the Secret Squadron. This version resembles the original version of Tom Thumb with the size-shifting of the Supreme Power version. During the fight with Siege Society, Tom Thumb was subdued by Hawkeye. Following the fight with the Siege Society, Tom Thumb's arm is in a sling as he, Nighthawk, and Blur mourn the deaths of their fallen comrades Amphibian, Arcanna Jones, Blue Eagle, and Golden Archer.<ref>''Heroes Reborn: Siege Society'' #1</ref>

==Tomazooma==
Tomazooma is a gigantic robot designed to resemble a Native American deity of the [[Wyatt Wingfoot|Keewazi]] people. The Red Star Oil Company built the robot to frighten the Keewazi into giving up their oil-rich land. Tomazooma fought [[Wyatt Wingfoot]] and the [[Fantastic Four]], who defeated it.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' (Vol.1) #80. November 1968.</ref>

When next seen, Tomazooma had been rebuilt into a cuckoo clock being used at a [[Bar With No Name]]. The [[Reanimator (comics)|Reanimator]] got his hands on Tomazooma and built it back to its original specifications. When the [[New Warriors]] attacked the Reanimator, [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] blew a hole through Tomazooma's chest.<ref>''Wolverine'' (Vol.2) #149. April 2000.</ref>

==Larry Trask==<!--[[Larry Trask (comics)]] redirects here-->
'''Larry Trask''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[Marvel Comics]], the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] son of scientist [[Bolivar Trask]], creator of the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]]. The character first appeared in ''[[X-Men (comic book)|X-Men]]'' #57 (June 1969) and was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Neal Adams]].

At the age of five, Larry's mutant power of [[precognition]] manifested when he predicted the death of his mother.<ref name="XMen59">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #59</ref> He lost his older sister Tanya soon after, as she was a mutant time-traveler who had become lost in the timestream.

Fearful of the "mutant menace," Bolivar crafted a medallion that would block Larry's powerful visions of the future, as well as erase any memory of them.<ref name="XMen58">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #58</ref> As his son grew older, Bolivar enlisted Larry's help in the creation of the first wave of [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]]. Bolivar occasionally removed Larry's medallion so that he could secretly observe and record Larry's predictions about mutants in the future, and Larry accurately predicted the assassination attempt of Senator [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Robert Kelly]].{{Issue|date=February 2019}}

Larry was skeptical of his father's hatred of mutants, until the night his sister Tanya (now calling herself [[Madame Sanctity]]) returned to the past. Tanya hoped to change the future by stopping her father's creation of the Sentinels, but she was thwarted by her friend [[Rachel Summers]]. Though Rachel successfully prevented Larry from witnessing the psychic duel that ensued, she could not hide the physical damage caused by the fight. This convinces Larry that dangerous mutants do exist.{{Issue|date=February 2019}}

Larry Trask later blames the [[X-Men]] for his father's death, and used Bolivar's notes to create a new, stronger wave of Sentinels. He was aided in his effort by Federal Judge Robert Chalmers, who was a friend of Bolivar's and knew Larry's secret.<ref name="XMen59" /> Larry Trask created a base for his Sentinels inside the [[Colorado Rockies (mountains)|Colorado Rockies]], and he ordered the robots to abduct and detain all known mutants. One of these mutants was [[Havok (comics)|Alex Summers]]; Larry gave him a containment suit to control his unstable powers.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #57-59</ref> Chalmers became disillusioned with Larry's plans, and he forcefully removed Larry's medallion, hoping that Larry would cease his attacks on mutants if he learned the truth about his own mutation. This, however, backfired; when a furious Larry gave the order for Sentinels to destroy all mutants, he himself was targeted for annihilation.<ref name="XMen58" />

The Sentinels are eventually outwitted by [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], and fly into the sun (perceived by them as the source of all mutations) to apparently be destroyed.<ref name="XMen59" /> Meanwhile, Larry has plunged into a state of catatonic shock, and Chalmers puts the medallion back on him to erase the knowledge of what had happened to him.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #60</ref>

The Mark II Sentinels later return from space, and abduct the [[Scarlet Witch]] as part of an elaborate plan to prevent the birth of future mutants by [[Human sterilization|sterilizing]] humanity. Larry is abducted by the Scarlet Witch's brother [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], who remembers Trask from when he and his sister were previously abducted by the Sentinels.<ref name="XMen59" /> Quicksilver removes Larry's medallion, restoring Larry's knowledge of a Sentinel base in [[Australia]].<ref name="Aveng102">''The Avengers'' #102-104. Marvel Comics.</ref> The duo travels to the secret base, and Larry stops the Sentinels by revealing that the lead Sentinel was mutated during its time in space, causing the others to turn on it and destroy it, thus deactivating themselves. One of the Sentinels falls onto Larry and kills him.<ref name="Aveng102" />

===Other versions of Larry Trask===
*In the one-shot special ''What If...Magneto & Professor X Had Formed the X-Men Together?'', Larry Trask is the billionaire leader of Trask Industries. His anti-mutant prejudice leads him to attack [[Professor X|Charles Xavier's]] Good Shepherd Clinic with a fleet of Sentinels. The strike is unsuccessful, but it spurs the formation of the X-Men in that universe. Later, Larry Trask is revealed to be one of the Lords Cardinal of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] (along with [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]], [[Harry Leland]], and [[Donald Pierce]]). It is unclear if this version of Larry is aware of his own status as a mutant, or that he is working with mutants as well.{{issue|date=December 2012}}
*In the alternate universe of [[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]], Dr. Lawrence Trask has physically bonded with the Sentinel hardware inside his mountain base, becoming a Prime-Sentinel. He is possessed by [[Madelyne Pryor]], who leads his Sentinels in an attack on the heroes of [[New York City]].<ref>''Mutant X'' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Trauma==
'''Trauma''', real name '''Troh-Maw''', was the son of Lord Armageddon, the ruler of an extraterrestrial race known as the Troyjans. Trauma came to Earth to collect on a debt from the [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]]'s leader Agamemnon, who had promised the Troyjans one of his descendants in exchange for technology to extend his children's lifespans. Trauma often stormed the Pantheon's headquarters to take Atalanta, who always drew him back. After the [[Hulk]] joined the Pantheon, Trauma cornered Atalanta in the [[Himalayas]] and confessed his love for her, but was defeated by the Hulk before he could kidnap her. Trauma later abducted Atalanta and brought her to his homeworld, with the Hulk and the Pantheon in pursuit. The Hulk arrived in time to stop the wedding and challenged Trauma to a duel. Their fight ended when Trauma stumbled over a piece of armor and pierced his heart. Before dying, Trauma proved his love to Atalanta by releasing the Pantheon from their debt and begging Lord Armageddon to allow the Pantheon to return to Earth.<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Manning |first2=Matthew K. |year=2008 |title=Hulk: The Incredible Guide |publisher=[[DK Publishing]] |page=96 |isbn=978-0-7566-4169-6|edition=Updated }}</ref>

==Tuck==
'''Tuck''' is the partner of [[Death's Head]] from [[Marvel UK]] comics. She was created by [[Dan Abnett]] and [[Liam Sharp]], and first appeared in ''Death's Head'' #3 (February 1993).

Tuck is a Replicated Organic, an artificial human created on a planet called Lionheart. She was illegally created by a "tissue broker", who, fearing the authorities (all higher technology is forbidden), sold her to a [[brothel]]. She escaped and eventually joined Death's Head and his group of [[outlaw]]s, and accompanied him on his complex travels through time and [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]]s.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

During an unspecified time she was intentionally infected by a (eventually harmless) strain of the "plague perfection" - a synthetic virus designed to target only replicated humans and cyborgs. The search produced nothing, as there is no cure.

Tuck is a synthetic human, designed to be slightly superior to a normal human in physical abilities. She is skilled in stealth and combat using [[Medieval]] weapons. At one point she gains a powerful cosmic artifact called the ''Sapphire Lotus'' which boosts her strength and durability to many times greater than normal, and grants her the power to generate large amounts of energy. She later loses all but a small shard of this object, which still boosts her strength fivefold, and increases her athletic abilities and healing rate.

John Keane is a costumed criminal acrobat. Intending to test himself against [[Captain America]], he broke into [[Avengers Mansion]]. He easily beat Captain America in two separate struggles—although, this turned out to be the [[Super-Adaptoid]], who had taken Captain America's form and lacked his fighting skills. The real Captain America freed himself from the Adaptoid's trap and defeated the Tumbler in combat.{{issue|date=December 2011}}<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |pages=353–354}}</ref>

Later, the Tumbler was hired by Quentin Harderman as a part of the [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]]'s plot to discredit Captain America. The Tumbler robbed a store, and Captain America tried to capture him but the Tumbler escaped. The next day, John Keane in civilian clothes was told to meet Captain America at a charity boxing match; however the Captain recognized Keane and he ran. Captain America knocked Keane down with his shield, and as the two struggled, the first [[Nefarius|Moonstone]] shot and killed Keane with a micro laser under orders from Harderman while hiding out of sight. Harderman accused Captain America of murdering the Tumbler as part of the scheme to discredit him.<ref>''Captain America'' #169 (January 1974)</ref>

===Michael Keane===
It was later revealed that John Keane was using his ill-gotten gains that he had taken as the Tumbler to pay for his mother's living and her home, while his brother Michael was in the army. He had also taken out a million-dollar life insurance policy with the Guardian Life Insurance Policy. When Michael tried to collect on this policy, Guardian Life Insurance Policy refused to pay the claim since John had been killed in an illegal act. Michael trained hard and took on his brother's identity as the Tumbler, getting Captain America's help to expose the insurance company's fraud.<ref>''Captain America'' #291</ref>

===Unnamed man===
After receiving the Tumbler gear from Michael Keane, [[Roderick Kingsley]] sold it to an unnamed criminal. Tumbler, [[Ringer (comics)|Ringer]], and [[Steeplejack (Marvel Comics)|Steeplejack]] are shown to be in the services of Roderick Kingsley. They were later ambushed by the Goblin King's servants Menace and Monster (the "Goblin" form of [[Carlie Cooper]]).<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #25</ref>

==Tundra==
'''Tundra''' is a mystical spirit which inhabits an ever-growing mass of Canadian land in gargantuan semi-humanoid form, and is the enemy of the Inuit gods whom he trapped in another dimension.<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=354}}</ref> Tundra was the first of the [[Great Beasts]] confronted by [[Alpha Flight]].<ref>''[[Alpha Flight]] #1''</ref> Tundra was summoned through a mystic ritual in which a possessed Richard Easton traced a gigantic human shape in the barren land of [[Canada]]'s Northwest Territories and then donned a metallic crown that summoned the spirit of Tundra. Easton's corpse animated, the land mimicking the corpse's movement until Tundra rose in the shape of a humanoid mass of earth. According to [[Shaman (comics)|Shaman]], Tundra was supposed to be controlled by the mind of the human who summoned him but because of the weakened state of Richard Easton when summoning Tundra, Tundra's real personality quickly took over.{{Issue|date=February 2010}} Tundra's powers stem from the land itself. He can summon mosquitoes, hurl boulders from his body, increase his size by absorbing land mass, and is connected to the land so if he is injured, earthquake-style upheavals occur in the surrounding area.

==Twilight==
'''Twilight''' was character created by [[Marvel Comics]] for their [[Marvel 2099]] run ''[[X-Nation 2099]]''. This short-lived series only lasted six issues before being terminated. In the year 2099, [[Doom 2099|President Doom]] contacted [[Cerebra]] of the [[X-Men 2099]] to let her know about a recent [[prophecy]] about a ''Mutant [[Messiah]]''. She undertook the task of locating and training possible candidates and bringing them to '''Halo City''', one of which was Twilight.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Little is known about the girl before she arrived at Halo City, but she soon became a part of the teen group [[X-Nation 2099|X-Nation]]. It was some time later that Avian decided to mount a mission to recapture [[Willow (comics)|Willow]] in a bid to be the first to find the messiah for himself. He attacked the children and succeeded in capturing Willow again. Wanting to rescue their friend, X-Nation decided to infiltrate the Million Palms facility and save her. At first, Twilight was unwilling to go but after she misheard a conversation between Cerebra and '''Sister Nicholas''' where she thought they were going to experiment on the children she agreed. However, their fledgling efforts ended in their capture. They were able to escape, but upon their return home they found that Halo City was devastated.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Their home had been blown up by the Atlantean army and was being flooded. To add insult to injury, [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]] had awoken from another century-long slumber and tried to make X-Nation his [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]]. They refused and were subsequently beaten, but Twilight was one of the few who implicitly didn't trust Exodus. The rest of the group joined her opinion when Exodus refused to save the human population of Halo City and they refused to be in service to him. Twilight tried to strike down the powerful mutant with her powers, but he was actually able to leave her "sphere of influence" unharmed. He struck back at her, nearly killing her if not for the magical intervention of ''Mademoiselle Strange''. After Clarion sacrificed himself in the battle with Exodus, the rest of the kids were [[Teleportation|teleported]] away by Mlle Strange to face their uncertain futures.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

They travel to the [[Savage Land]]—the last inhabitable place on earth—and begin to form a society there. Twilight travels to [[Mars]] with [[December (comics)|December]], [[Metalsmith (comics)|Metalsmith]], and several others to see if the red planet has any resources that can be used by the [[colonist]]s. They get attacked by aliens and crash land, but make it to the Ares base. While there, the resident doctor tells them that lately their children had begun to be abducted at night by aliens called the "Takers".{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Later that night, Twilight goes missing so December and Metalsmith go looking for her, but are [[ambush]]ed. Twilight returns on her own later and explains the origin of the Takers and also that the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] were about to invade earth. Not knowing what to do, Twilight decides to stay with the Takers, and Metalsmith stays with her. But neither of them decide to tell this to December, who is left behind on Mars when the couple blasts off with the Takers, who fly towards the Phalanx [[mother ship]]. They, alongside the Takers, are successful in boarding the ship, but they meet an untimely fate.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Down on earth, a robot left behind by [[Mister Fantastic]] named ''Franklin''—who has had an enigmatic connection to the Phalanx since his creation—realizes that the Phalanx are evil. Downloading several needed programs, Franklin detonates the Phalanx ship with Twilight and Metalsmith still inside.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Twilight was capable of generating a reality warping "sphere of influence" in which she could do many things including: fly, become intangible, teleport herself and others, cause things to burn, shrink, explode, melt, or reform in various ways. She also displayed a latent form of [[telepathy]] which Exodus was unable to eavesdrop on, but whether that was one of the reality warping feats or a different mutation is unknown.

'''Tyrannus''' first appeared in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' #5 (January 1963), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=386}}</ref> The character was inspired by Ayesha, the protagonist of [[H. Rider Haggard|H. Rider Haggard's]] 1887 novel ''[[She: A History of Adventure]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=90}}</ref>

In the [[Roman Empire]], Tyrannus claims to be a "[[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]]", but is actually a [[scientist]] far ahead of his time. He was exiled by [[King Arthur (Marvel Comics)|King Arthur]] and [[Merlin (Marvel Comics)|Merlin]] to [[Subterranea (comics)|Subterranea]], a network of caves and tunnels miles beneath the Earth's surface when he tries to conquer Britain. There Tyrannus discovers a race of orange-skinned semi-humanoid Subterraneans who are eager to find in him a new master to serve. He also discovers a pool of liquid which he drinks to maintain his youth through the centuries. The Subterraneans acquaint Tyrannus with examples and records of technology designed by the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]] who were their original masters. Tyrannus' scientific genius enables him to master and improve upon the Deviants' scientific wonders over the centuries.  Tyrannus becomes Emperor of the Tyrannoid Subterraneans and an aspiring conqueror.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia|last=DeFalco|first=Tom|year= 2006|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|isbn=978-0-7566-2358-6|page=309}}</ref>

In the modern era, Tyrannus is finally ready to use this technology and the Subterraneans in conquering the surface world. He makes several attempts as well as fighting wars against the forces of a new arrival in Subterranea, the [[Mole Man]].

Tyrannus woos [[Betty Ross]] underground and kidnaps her with his Tyrannoids. When the [[Hulk]] challenges him, he agrees to give her back on the condition that the Hulk performs a list of nigh-impossible menial tasks. However, eventually the Hulk completes the list and causes a lot of damage in the Kingdom, and Tyrannus is forced to honor his word.<ref>''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|Incredible Hulk]]'' #5 (January 1963)</ref> Tyrannus is reverted to an old man when the Mole Man captures his "fountain of youth". Tyrannus uses the Hulk as a pawn by teleporting him underground and recapturing the fountain. Banner succeeds in teleporting himself back.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #80-81</ref> Tyrannus forces scientist [[Cobalt Man|Ralph Roberts]] to design a gigantic robot for him to use in his war against the Mole Man, but is defeated by the [[X-Men]].<ref>''X-Men'' #34</ref> He decides to gain revenge on the Hulk by using advanced technology to temporarily drive him into destructive rampages. He uses the Hulk and the robot Mogul as slaves in his war against the Mole Man.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #127</ref> He later secretly allies with [[Kala (comics)|Kala]] against the Mole Man.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #127-128</ref> Tyrannus projects his consciousness into a Subterranean, who attacks New York City but is thwarted by [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]].<ref>''Nova'' #5</ref>

In the guise of the aged Des, he became an ally of Prince Rey and the Keeper of the Flame of El Dorado, an immensely powerful cobalt energy "flame" that had been created in the Andes Mountains of South America by the Deviants and had been maintained by the people of the lost city of El Dorado. "Des" then captured the Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #240</ref> "Des" was then restored to his youthfulness, and killed Rey and the Keeper.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #241</ref> Tyrannus then merged with the Flame, allowing his consciousness to control the Flame.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #242</ref> The Hulk destroys the machinery from which the Flame arises, and the Flame, still infused with Tyrannus's consciousness, is hurled far into outer space.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #243</ref>

The [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]]'s atomized body later merges with the disembodied mind of Tyrannus. This gestalt being attempts to force Bruce Banner to cure this condition, but the procedure goes wrong, leaving Tyrannus' mind in the Abomination's body and returning Blonsky to a normal human form.<ref>''Incredible Hulk Annual'' #15</ref> Tyrannus briefly operates as the Abomination and attacks [[Wonder Man]],<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #25</ref> and [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]],<ref>''Solo Avengers'' #12</ref> until [[Ghaur]] and [[Llyra]] free Tyrannus from the Abomination's body and restore him to human form; Tyrannus then adopted the guise of Dr. Tyrone.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual #23''</ref> As Dr. Tyrone, he transformed a number of alcoholics and drug addicts into serpent men, and enslaved [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #9</ref> Tyrannus then battled [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and [[Doctor Strange]]. He attempted to bring Set to Earth, but was attacked by [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]] and swallowed by a serpent demon.<ref>''Daredevil Annual'' #4</ref>

Bruce Banner and [[Skaar (character)|Skaar]] later fight Tyrannus when he and the Tyrannoids attack Manhattan.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #605</ref> Tyrannus's [[energy sword]] reappears in Banner's possession during the funeral for [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]]. He gives the sword to [[Amadeus Cho]] when they are forced to battle [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] and [[Phobos (Marvel Comics)|Phobos]].<ref>''Hercules: Fall of an Avenger'' #2</ref>

Later when he tried to acquire Pandora's Box he acquired the help of Betty Ross (the Red She-Hulk) to help him in this endeavor by tricking the Hulk into opening the casing of the powerful artifact by thinking Betty was trapped inside, thus releasing its energies in the process.<ref>''The Incredible Hulks'' #626</ref> Later in the same story arc, Red She-Hulk is shown to not only run off with Tyrannus in her Red She-Hulk form but also sleeps with him,<ref>''The Incredible Hulks'' #630</ref> although she eventually returns to Hulk after reconciling her rebellious Hulk instincts with her human desires.<ref>''The Incredible Hulks'' #635</ref>

Tyrannus was granted superhuman longevity and youth after drinking from the [[Fountain of Youth]] in [[Subterranea (comics)|Subterranea]]; he is dependent on this fountain of youth to maintain his youth and immortality. He possesses various lingering [[psionic]] abilities after his merger with the cobalt "Flame of Life" in El Dorado, including telepathy, mind control of others, and the ability to drain the life force of others; these abilities have not been demonstrated in later appearances. He is an extraordinary scientific genius that Bruce Banner has acknowledged as superior to himself, and has achieved mastery of the advanced technology of the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]] which he found in Subterranea, upon which he has made further advances. Tyrannus has limited mystic knowledge of sorcery.

Tyrannus often uses ancient Roman weaponry (e.g., swords and spears), but also has access to weapons created by Deviant technology, including guns projecting various types of radiation, and other advanced technological weaponry. He has designed other devices based on Deviant technology and his own innovations, which was manufactured by Subterraneans under his supervision. These include teleportation devices, flying vehicles, and gigantic earth-borers.

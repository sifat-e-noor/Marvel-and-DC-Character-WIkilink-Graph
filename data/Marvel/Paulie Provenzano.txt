'''Blackjack O'Hare''' is a fictional [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[hare]] in [[Marvel Comics]]. The character, created by [[Bill Mantlo]] and [[Sal Buscema]], first appeared in ''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #271 (May 1982).

Blackjack O'Hare is a mercenary and leader of the Black Bunny Brigade. He was hired by Judson Jakes and Lord Dyvyne to kidnap [[Lylla]], the C.E.O. of Mayhem Mekaniks. He planned on betraying his employers by marrying Lylla and inheriting the company, but was found out. He was rescued by [[Rocket Raccoon]] and after a series of incidents that caused him to question his own loyalty, he aided Rocket in defeating the tyrants and left with his new friends to start a new life.<ref>''Rocket Raccoon'' #1-4</ref>

All this appeared to be false when Rocket visited Halfworld and discovered that Blackjack, along with Lylla and [[Wal Rus]], were all actually service animals for the mental patients who inhabited the planet. Blackjack married Lylla after Rocket left to ensure the imprisonment of a dangerous criminal.<ref>''Annihilators'' #3</ref>

However, this story was immediately retconned as Blackjack returned as a mercenary and adversary to Rocket and [[Groot]]. Blackjack was once again working for Dyvyne with his next assignment being that he kidnap Princess Lynx. Rocket, Groot and Wal Rus arrived to defeat Blackjack, his brigade and Dyvyne, once again.<ref>''Free Comic Book Day Rocket Raccoon''</ref>

He turned up again, disguised as an impostor Rocket and framing him for a series of murders.<ref>''Rocket Raccoon'' vol. 2 #1</ref> He reveals his identity to Rocket and claims that the reason for framing him was that he ruined his chance to assassinate Princess Amalya and destroyed his reputation in the process. Amalya had become a "General" and arrived with Rocket's ex's in an effort to exterminate him themselves. Blackjack considered the possibility of assassinating her now, but was shot by Amalya because he was talking out loud. As a last ditch effort he fires a missile at Rocket, but it gets deflected and Blackjack is presumably killed.<ref>''Rocket Raccoon'' vol. 2 #4</ref>

After seeing that T'Challa is alive, and thus still legally King with the personal combat challenge incomplete, she leads the Dora to fight against Killmonger the moment he invalidates his own claim by refusing to continue the challenge. During W'Kabi's fight with M'Baku, Okoye eventually convinces W'Kabi to stand down causing those fighting alongside him to also stand down.

The '''One Below All''' is the "dark reflection" or evil manifestation of the One-Above-All, created by [[Al Ewing]] and [[Joe Bennett (artist)|Joe Bennett]], and first appeared in ''The Immortal Hulk'' #5 in the form of [[Hulk|Bruce Banner]]'s father, [[Brian Banner]], his agent. Alluded to as the [[Qliphoth|qlippoth]], or "Hulk", of [[God]], the One Below All is a malevolent and destructive force; when it speaks, it states that "I howl through many mouths. I break with many hands. They are themselves, but they are also me. I have all the power you give me and my weapon is hate.",<ref>''The Immortal Hulk'' #12. Marvel Comics</ref> in contrast to the One-Above-All's statement that "I see through many eyes. I build with many hands. They are themselves, but they are also me. I am all-powerful. My only weapon is love.".<ref>''The Ultimates²'' #100. Marvel Comics.</ref> The One Below All is alluded to as the source of all gamma mutations in the Marvel Universe.

The One Below All resides in the Below Place, which is the lowest layer of Hell. It, as well as the Below Place, is kept behind a metaphysical 'Green Door'. This was first discovered by [[Brian Banner]] in a dream.<ref>''The Immortal Hulk'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref> The One Below All is also assumed to be the reason Brian began to drink, lose his mind, and eventually kill his wife. When it came to the day of the first gamma bomb test, helmed by Bruce Banner, the One Below All's powers were released when the power of its detonation partially opened the Green Door and created the first gamma mutate, the Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulks'' #360. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The One Below All possessed Jailbait of the [[Riot Squad (comics)|Riot Squad]] who lost control of her powers. When she died, her brother Hotshot had to hold a church hostage in order to perform the last rites of Jailbait. He claimed that Jailbait was possessed by the devil.<ref>''The Immortal Hulk'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Then the One Below All possessed [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] after he was killed in a bar fight. This drove Sasquatch on a feral rampage until the Hulk defeated Sasquatch and drained the gamma energy out of him until Sasquatch regressed back to Walter Langkowski.<ref>''The Immortal Hulk'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> Through this absorption of Sasquatch's gamma energy, the One Below All then transferred into Banner, mocking the Hulk from within Banner's mind with the image of Brian Banner. Brian's ghost was able to regain some control of himself and told the Hulk about the One Below All's plan to enter and control a host body.<ref>''The Immortal Hulk'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The One Below All managed to gain control of the [[Absorbing Man]]'s body through an experimental procedure using gamma radiation to make him strong enough to fight the Hulk. When his soul encountered the One Below All, the Absorbing Man was unable to comprehend its true form, so much so that his physical body was possessed and split in half, and made its way to the site of the first gamma bomb detonation. While fighting the Hulk, The One Below All absorbed a great deal of his gamma energy, rendering him weak and misshapen. The two reached a stalemate, with the Hulk reabsorbing energy only for the Absorbing Man to take it back again, until Puck uses a specialised weapon to blast a hole through the Hulk's chest, while the Absorbing Man escapes. Using the ambient gamma radiation from the gamma bomb's detonation, The One Below All uses the Absorbing Man to open the Green Door and plunges New Mexico into the Below Place.<ref>''The Immortal Hulk'' #9-10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After the Hulk and Bruce Banner split apart, the One Below All appears in its 'true' green cloud form as it prepares to take over the rest of Earth. When the Hulk opposes its plan, the One Below All unleashes demons, shaped like the empty 'husks' of people, on him, one in particular the husk of General Ross, which transforms into a husk of the Red Hulk to fight. With help from the Absorbing Man and Puck, the Hulk was able to reabsorb the Absorbing Man's gamma radiation and use his thunder clap to disperse the One Below All's cloud form and end his threat to the world.<ref>''The Immortal Hulk'' #12-13. Marvel Comics.</ref>

[[Doctor Strange]] later spoke to [[Mephisto (Marvel Comics)|Mephisto]] about removing the One Below All's possession from the Hulk after the brief [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] reunion. Mephisto, however, states that the One Below All is far stronger than he is.<ref>''Defenders: The Best Defense'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

A [[flashforward]] to the end of the [[Marvel Universe]] shows the One Below All still controlling the body of the Hulk and consuming the sentience of the cosmos, forcibly taking on the same role as [[Galactus]] for the next iteration of the Multiverse and becoming the "Breaker of Worlds".<ref>''The Immortal Hulk'' #24-25. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Absolute Carnage]]" storyline, Bruce Banner had a theory that [[Knull (comics)|Knull]] can either be an aspect of the One Below All or a creature that it controls.<ref>''Absolute Carnage: Immortal Hulk'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the final issues of ''The Immortal Hulk'', as well as its one-shot ''Time of Monsters'' and spinoff one-shot ''Empyre: The Immortal She-Hulk'',<ref>''The Immortal She-Hulk''. Marvel Comics</ref> it is shown how the One Below All brings anyone mutated with gamma radiation to the Below-Place, with the first human to be so being Tammuz from Jordan, 9500 BCE.<ref>''The Immortal Hulk: Time of Monsters''. Marvel Comics</ref> Later, gamma-mutated scientists Brian Banner and Samuel Sterns (the [[Leader (character)|Leader]]), both enemies to Bruce Banner, were transported to the Below-Place via the Green Door where they both were merged into a being Sterns was primarily in control of and called after his own alias, the Leader.<ref>''The Immortal Hulk'' #34-35, 39-42. Marvel Comics</ref> The being was tasked to destroy Bruce Banner.

After the Leader imprisoned the Banner persona (from his own mindscape) in the Below-Place, the Hulk and Joe Fixit personas controlled his body and fought the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. After that, he encountered the [[Fantastic Four]] who transported him via the Forever Gate to the Below-Place, where the personas separate and meet the Banner persona. They fight the Leader and destroy him, freeing Sterns. Finally, the two personas ask the One Below All about the reason for the Hulk's existence and demand to show his actual face behind the clouds. The One Below All agrees and the green clouds are replaced and outshined by a yellow glowing light coming from the One Above All, who reveals himself to be simultaneously serving as the embodiment of creation and all good and of destruction and all evil. The One Above All says the Hulk's existence is a necessity and that the latter serves as a counterweight to other, lesser good. He tells that the Hulk can be what it chooses to be: strong and ruthless, or forbearing and humane. In case of what to do with Sterns, who laid on the ground beside, the Hulk decides that he is to be forgiven. Afterwards, the Fantastic Four brought all three personas, now together in the body of Bruce Banner,  as well as Sterns, back to Earth.<ref>''The Immortal Hulk'' #49-50. Marvel Comics</ref>

'''Oracle''' is a [[Shi'ar]] who is a member of the Shi'ar [[Imperial Guard (Marvel Comics)|Imperial Guard]]. The character, created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Dave Cockrum]], first appeared in ''The [[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #107 (Oct. 1977). Oracle, whose alter-ego is Lady Sybil, has [[telepathy]] and can exert control over others' minds. Using this power, she can project stun bolts. She also has psychoscopic awareness, or "Mind-Sight": the ability to expand her over-consciousness to read the impressions left by events in the fabric of time and matter. Like many original members of the Imperial Guard, Oracle is the analog of a character from [[DC Comics]]' [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]: in her case [[Saturn Girl]].<ref name=CBR>Cronin, Brian. [https://www.cbr.com/x-men-dark-phoenix-saga-shiar-imperial-guard/ "Comic Legends: Why New Imperial Guard Members in Dark Phoenix Saga?"], ''CBR'' (APR 09, 2018).</ref><ref name=Cronin2>Cronin, Brian. [https://www.cbr.com/wolverine-costume-gallery/ "Wolverine: Every Costume Marvel's Latest Resurrected Mutant Has Worn, Ever,"] ''CBR'' (AUG. 25, 2018).</ref> Oracle is originally romantically linked with fellow Imperial Guardsman [[Starbolt]];<ref name="X-Men #107. Marvel Comics" /> she is later engaged to marry [[Flashfire (comics)|Flashfire]]<ref name=Inhumans>''Inhumans'' vol. 3, #3 (Aug. 2000).</ref> (an analog of [[Lightning Lad]], to whom Saturn Girl was also romantically linked).

Part of the division of the Imperial Guard known as the Superguardians, Oracle is amongst the first of the Imperial Guard encountered by the team of superhuman mutant adventurers known as the [[X-Men]] who sought to rescue the Princess-Majestrix [[Lilandra Neramani]] from her insane brother, then-Majestor [[D'Ken]].<ref name="X-Men #107. Marvel Comics">''X-Men'' #107. Marvel Comics (Oct. 1977).</ref> After the battle, Lilandra takes over as Majestrix, and the Guard swears allegiance to her.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #122 (June 1979).</ref>

Later, a renegade faction of the Imperial Guard become traitors, deciding to serve Lord Samédàr, [[Deathbird]], and the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] in their conspiracy to overthrow Shi'ar Princess-Majestrix Lilandra. Oracle is one of the faction of the Guard that remains loyal to Lilandra and, with the X-Men's help, battles the renegades.<ref name=XMen157-158>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #157-158 (May–June 1982).</ref>

Deathbird succeeds in a second coup attempt. Oracle is with the Guard when they come into conflict with a rogue Space Knight named Pulsar and an alien named Tyreseus. After a large battle which also involves [[Rom the Space Knight|Rom]] and other Space Knights — which leads to the deaths of four new Guardsman — Pulsar and Tyreseus are defeated.<ref name=RomAnnual4>''Rom'' Annual #4 (Dec. 1985).</ref>

Empress Deathbird commands the entire Imperial Guard, including Oracle, to fight the combined forces of the [[Starjammers]] and [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] on Earth so that she can claim the power of the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]] for herself. The Guard are forced to retreat when [[Deathbird]] is put in danger.<ref name=xmsos2>''X-Men: Spotlight on... Starjammers'' #2 (June 1990).</ref> (Some time later [[Skrull|War Skrulls]] impersonating [[Charles Xavier]] and the Starjammers depose Deathbird and restore [[Lilandra Neramani]] to the throne. Deathbird cedes the empire back to Lilandra as she has grown bored of the bureaucracy.)<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #274-277 (Mar.–June 1991).</ref>

Oracle is again part of the mission during [[Operation: Galactic Storm]], an intergalactic war between the Shi'ar and the [[Kree]]. The Imperial Guard are integral to the Sh'iar creating a massive super weapon — the "Nega-Bomb" — using Kree artifacts, including the original [[Mar-Vell|Captain Marvel]]'s [[Nega-Bands]], which the Guard steals from the dead hero's tomb. This bomb is capable of devastating an area equivalent to that of the Kree Empire (which is supposedly located throughout the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]]). Ultimately, the Nega Bomb device is successfully detonated, devastating the Kree Empire, with billions dying instantaneously (98% of the Kree population).<ref>''[[Wonder Man]]'' #9 (May 1992).</ref> The Shi'ar annex the remnants of the Kree Empire, with Deathbird becoming [[viceroy]] of the Kree territories.<ref>''The Avengers'' #347 (May 1992).</ref>

Oracle has many further adventures with the Imperial Guard, in storylines involving [[Ronan the Accuser]] and the [[Inhumans]],<ref name=Inhumans/><ref>''[[Inhumans]]'' vol. 3 #4 (Oct. 2000).</ref> and such storylines as "[[Emperor Vulcan]],"<ref>''Emperor Vulcan'' #1–5 (Nov. 2007–Mar. 2008).</ref> "Secret Invasion,"<ref>''Secret Invasion: [[Inhumans]]'' #3–4 (Dec. 2008–Jan. 2009).</ref> ''[[X-Men: Kingbreaker]],''<ref name=XMenKingbreaker>''X-Men: Kingbreaker'' #1–4 (Feb.–May 2009).</ref> "[[War of Kings]],"<ref>''War of Kings'' (May–Oct. 2009).</ref> "[[Realm of Kings]],"<ref>''Realm of Kings: Imperial Guard'' (Jan.–May 2010).</ref> the "[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]" crossover,<ref>''Infinity'' #1–6 (Oct. 2013–Jan. 2014).</ref> the "Trial of Jean Grey,"<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #13 (May 2014).</ref> "Time Runs Out,"<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 5 #43-44 (June 2015).</ref> and the return of [[Thanos]].<ref>''Thanos'' vol. 2 #3 (Mar. 2017).</ref>

'''Emily Osborn''' is a supporting character in [[Marvel Comics]]. The character, created by [[J. M. DeMatteis]] and [[Sal Buscema]], first appeared (as a photo) in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #180 (September 1991). She was [[Norman Osborn]]'s wife and [[Harry Osborn]]'s mother.

She was apparently the only person that Norman ever showed love to, but their son's birth had weakened her with her dying sometime after.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #180</ref>

However, Emily turns up alive where she faked her death and poses as "Emma", a nanny hired by [[Liz Allan]] to be there for [[Normie Osborn]] and Stanley Osborn.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #789</ref> She later took blood samples of her grandchildren for unknown reasons.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #791</ref>

During the "Go Down Swinging" storyline, Emily finds out that the Red Goblin is coming after their grandchildren. To keep Normie and Stanley safe, Emily abducts the two.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #798</ref> Liz had tracking chips placed in the children as Liz, [[Molten Man|Mark Raxton]] and Harry find the children and discover that "Emma" is actually Emily. When the Red Goblin attacks, Emily gets away with Harry, Liz, Mark, Normie and Stanley while the Red Goblin fights with two [[Silk (comics)|Spider]] [[Miles Morales|individuals]] as well as the [[Human Torch]] and [[Clash (comics)|Clash]].

===Emily Osborn in other media===
* Emily Osborn is alluded in the 2002 movie ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]''. It is implied by Norman that he and Emily had an acrimonious divorce as he talks to Harry about his new relationship with Mary Jane. A picture of her can be seen. 
* Emily Osborn has non-voiced appearances in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' animated series (intended to have been voiced by [[Marina Sirtis]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gregxb.tumblr.com/post/44900613951/trivia-had-the-spectacular-spider-man-continued|title=Greg's Blog of Clue-By-Fours}}</ref>). This depiction doesn't appear interested in anything that's going on around her. She appears in the episodes "[[Competition (The Spectacular Spider-Man)|Competition]]", "Blueprints" and "Final Curtain".
* Emily Osborn appears in the 2011 musical ''[[Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark]]''. 
* Emily Osborn is mentioned in the 2018 ''[[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' video game. Pictures of her can be seen throughout Norman Osborn's apartment and a recording to her can be found. Prior to the game, she died of complications from [[List of autoimmune diseases|Oshtoran Syndrome]]. Harry Osborn had wanted to be an environmental attorney like his mother and it is later revealed that he himself is also dying from the same disease that claimed his mother, leading to Norman working tirelessly to find a cure leading to the development of the Devil's Breath virus, presumably as Norman cannot bear losing his son like he lost his wife.

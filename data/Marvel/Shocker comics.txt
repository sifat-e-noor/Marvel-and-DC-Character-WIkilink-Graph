The '''Shocker''' ('''Herman Schultz''') is a <!--Do not add "fictional" as it is tautological; supervillains (and characters in general) are by definition implied to be fictionalized to some extent.-->[[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[John Romita Sr.|John Romita Sr]], the character debuted in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #46 in March 1967. He is usually depicted as an enemy of the superhero [[Spider-Man]], and belongs to the collective of adversaries that make up his [[List of Spider-Man enemies|rogues gallery]].

In the comics, Herman Schultz was originally a [[Autodidacticism|self-taught]] engineer and renowned [[Safe-cracking|safe cracker]] who invented a pair of [[Gauntlet (glove)|gauntlets]] capable of producing powerful vibrational [[shock wave]]s. He incorporated these gauntlets into a protective battlesuit and became a [[mercenary]] for hire. As the Shocker, Schultz quickly rose in [[New York City]]'s criminal underworld and has been employed by various [[Crime boss|crime lords]], which has often put him into conflict with Spider-Man. One notable trait that differentiates the Shocker from most other Spider-Man villains is his pursuit of wealth and a comfortable life rather than revenge or chaos. As a result, the Shocker has sometimes put aside his differences with Spider-Man and has helped him or other heroes when it was in his best interest.
	
The character was ranked as Spider-Man's 23rd greatest enemy by [[IGN]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 25 Spider-Man Villains|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/top-25-spider-man-villains|website=IGN|date=April 16, 2014}}</ref> The Shocker has been adapted from the comics into various forms of media, having been voiced by [[Jim Cummings]] in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', [[Jeff Bennett]] in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', and [[Dave B. Mitchell|David B. Mitchell]] in the [[video game]] ''[[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|Spider-Man]]''. Two iterations of the character were featured in the 2017 [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'', with Herman Schultz portrayed by [[Bokeem Woodbine]] and '''[[Montana (comics)|Jackson Brice]]''' portrayed by [[Logan Marshall-Green]].

==Publication history==

In an interview, Romita discussed how he designed the character, "I used a lot of very subliminal feeling. While designing the Shocker costume, for some reason, I thought 'cushion' and 'quilt.' I'm thinking, if the guy has a shocking power and vibrates buildings so they fell apart by shaking them, then there's got to be some kind of cushion effect, and so, subliminally, I did it."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Romita |first1=John |title=John Romita --and all that jazz! |date=2007 |publisher=TwoMorrows Pub |location=Raleigh, N.C. |isbn=978-1-893905-75-7 |page=120}}</ref>

He appeared as a regular character in ''Thunderbolts'' from issue #157 to 162, when he deserted the team. He was also one of the main characters in "The Superior Foes of Spider-man" comic series.<ref name="Superior Foes of Spider-Man">{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=45238 |title=Spencer Gets Sinister With "Superior Foes of Spider-Man"|date=1 May 2013 |publisher=[[comicbookresources.com]]}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Herman Schultz was born in [[New York City]]. He was a [[high school]] [[wikt:dropout|dropout]] who had brilliant talents as both an inventor and an engineer. Instead of using such talents to gain legitimate employment, he became a successful burglar and the world's best [[safe-cracking|safe-cracker]] (according to him in later stories). After finally being caught and incarcerated for his crimes, he developed a pair of gauntlets designed to shoot air blasts, vibrating at high frequency.<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |pages=315–316}}</ref> Schultz uses his gauntlets to escape from prison and becomes the supervillain known as "the Shocker".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=121}}</ref> He defeats [[Spider-Man]] in their first confrontation (Spider-Man was at a disadvantage due to having a bad left arm sprain from an earlier battle with the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]]<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #44–45. Marvel Comics.</ref>) during a robbery. While robbing a bank, he was later beaten and sent back to prison after Spider-Man pinned Schultz's thumbs away from the gauntlets' triggers with the webbing and then knocked him out.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #46. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Shocker later stole an ancient stone tablet with an inscription for a formula that could restore youth, that had been earlier stolen by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #72. Marvel Comics.</ref> Likely Schultz's most ambitious solo exploit was his attempt to hold New York City for ransom by blacking out various electrical grids to spell out his name, and extort one million dollars from the city.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #151–152. Marvel Comics.</ref> He then made one million dollars by harassing a stock broker.<ref>''The Defenders'' #64. Marvel Comics.</ref> Shocker later joined [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Egghead]]'s [[Masters of Evil]] (with [[Radioactive Man (comics)|Radioactive Man]], [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]], [[Karla Sofen|Moonstone]], and [[Abner Jenkins|Beetle]]) to incriminate [[Hank Pym|Dr. Henry Pym]], then on trial for treason. The Masters battled the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in this encounter; Shocker was brainwashed and purposely abandoned by Egghead to deliver a false testimony,<ref>''Avengers'' #228. Marvel Comics.</ref> and subsequently cooperated with the authorities in exonerating the ex-Avenger.<ref>''The Avengers'' #229. Marvel Comics.</ref> Shocker was later hired by the Nazi war criminal Baron Von Lundt to kill [[Dominic Fortune]], and built the vibro-shock units into his entire uniform to do so.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref> Shocker was hired by the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] and [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] to induce [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] to join their organization.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #157. Marvel Comics.</ref> Shocker later attempted to steal thousands of charity dollars at the celebrity fund raiser for the New York City Library.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #335. Marvel Comics.</ref> He's captured by Spider-Man and sent to prison. He later escapes with the help of fellow inmate [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]]. By this time, he's developed severe confidence issues and has become terrified that the [[Scourge of the Underworld]] is going to kill him. A tipping point occurs when Spider-Man apprehends him and seems to not take him seriously. Enraged, Shocker defeats Spider-Man and is about to finish him off when a Scourge imposter intervenes, causing Shocker to flee.<ref>''The Deadly Foes of Spider-Man'' #1–3. Marvel Comics.</ref> When he next appeared his confidence issues are gone. He aims to hunt down Scourge himself and kill him first.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #364. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Shocker has proven to be a constant presence among Spider-Man's gallery of enemies. He often works as a member of a team (including [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]]'s [[Sinister Six#Sinister Seven|Sinister Seven]], [[Norman Osborn]]'s [[Sinister Six#Sinister Twelve|Sinister Twelve]], [[Doctor Octopus]]'s most recent [[Sinister Six#Civil War's Sinister Six|Sinister Six]], and the Masters of Evil) or in partnership with at least one other villain. Previous alliances include Boomerang, the Beetle, [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Leila Davis]], [[Hydro-Man]], and [[Speed Demon (Marvel Comics)|Speed Demon]] (all of which made up the [[Sinister Syndicate]]), and the [[Trapster]], [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]] and [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]]. He also teamed up with a large group of villains during the [[Acts of Vengeance]], when he helped them unsuccessfully attack the [[Fantastic Four]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #334. Marvel Comics.</ref> During one of his team-ups with Doctor Octopus, he participated in a raid on [[Avengers Mansion]], hoping to help conquer it as the heroes were distracted by the events of [[the Infinity War]]. Shocker was forced to fight alongside the heroes called the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] when alien doubles of both sides attacked. After the doubles stopped coming, Doctor Octopus tried to order Shocker and the others to continue fighting the heroes but instead, they turned on Doctor Octopus. They did not wish to harm the people who had helped save their lives. Shocker helped chase Doctor Octopus out of the building.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #28–29. Marvel Comics.</ref>

At one point in his career, Shocker became increasingly paranoid that he was on the Scourge of the Underworld's hit list, even though there was no actual proof that he was.<ref>''The Deadly Foes of Spider-Man'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> He thus started seeking ways to become more powerful, hoping to thwart any attempt on his life by the vigilante group.{{issue|date=September 2012}} Shocker somehow acquired actual superhuman vibration powers. As he becomes more powerful, he realizes that the new powers will eventually kill him. He seeks a vibrational harness to cure himself and is aided by [[Night Thrasher (Dwayne Taylor)|Night Thrasher]] and Spider-Man.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #109. Marvel Comics.</ref> Shocker has had Spider-Man on the ropes on several occasions, with timely interventions often saving Spider-Man. Individuals thwarting Shocker's victories over Spider-Man include security guards, Dominic Fortune, and even a Scourge of the Underworld impostor. Shocker has also let Spider-Man go on a few occasions, the first being when he found Spider-Man incapacitated with a bout of vertigo on the outside of a tall building. He doesn't kill Spider-Man, thinking it an unworthy end, but doesn't help him either.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #83. Marvel Comics.</ref> Shocker found another moment of victory over Spider-Man when he teamed up with the Trapster. Sent by the [[Friends of Humanity]] to assassinate [[List of Spider-Man supporting characters#Gwen Stacy's family|Paul Stacy]], the duo managed to glue Stacy and Spider-Man together and corner them, only to be called off their assignment moments before finishing them off.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #85–87. Marvel Comics.</ref> Shocker would later turn on the Trapster at the behest of Osborn of having Trapster eliminated as a potential witness against his recent attempt to frame Spider-Man for murder. Preparing to kill the resigned Trapster in an alley, he was attacked and rendered unconscious at the last minute by Spider-Man (then disguised under the alias [[Dusk (comics)|Dusk]]).<ref>''Spider-Man'' #91. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Shocker has a run-in with [[Iron Man]] on a subway car in NYC.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 3 #42. Marvel Comics.</ref> Shocker is hired by the [[Golem (comics)|Golem]], along with Constrictor and Jack O'Lantern, to protect a diamond delivery.

He accidentally evaporates his water-based ally with a misplaced vibration.<ref>''Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #51–52. Marvel Comics.</ref> He allied himself with Speed Demon of the New [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] in order to break into a particularly well-guarded safe. Though the police arrived at his hide-out in quick pursuit, he was saved by Speed Demon dashing in and stealing both the loot and Shocker's weapons, removing all traces of evidence (and, unfortunately for Shocker, also keeping the money to fund the Thunderbolts' further activities).<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In his first "[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]" appearance, he is shown to have been hired by a mobster to take out a subway train wagon full of jurors. After a brief battle with Spider-Man, he is knocked unconscious while Spider-Man uses his gauntlets to destroy rubble blocking the path. Although he seems cooperative at first, as soon as he is secured by Spider-Man, he activates a powerful shock in his gauntlets through his belt, causing the main exit to collapse and allowing him to escape.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #578–579.

==Characterization==
===Powers and abilities===
The Shocker wears a pair of gauntlets he designed with vibro-shock units known as "vibro-smashers" that, when activated by a pump-action thumb trigger, can project a concentrated blast of compressed air that vibrates at an intense frequency. This creates a series of rapid-succession high-pressure air blasts that result in a series of powerful impacts. This allows Shocker to both effectively throw long range vibrational punches from a distance, creating destructive vibrations that can crumble solid concrete and cause extensive damage to the human body and its internal organs, as well as throw shock waves which vibrate the structure of something in order to weaken or destroy it. A lesser known ability of the gauntlets allows Shocker to make incredible leaps, by directing the air blasts toward the ground in front of him. Holding the thumb triggers down for an extended period of time increases the intensity, speed, and even spread of the air blasts.

The feedback from the Shocker's gauntlets is extremely intense (the initial test almost killed him). To guard himself from this, he developed a protective costume consisting largely of yellow quilt patches designed to absorb the shock. The costume is made of foam-lined synthetic fabric which absorbs all vibrations and establishes a vibrational shield which deflects normal blows and allows him to slip from any grasp. The costume's appearance has been the source of ridicule on the part of Spider-Man and other characters. How fellow villain the [[Looter (comics)|Looter]] was able to once wield one of the gauntlets without wearing a protective costume and suffering injury is unclear, though his super strength and durability were presumably a factor. Despite having no superhuman abilities, his vibrating suit and gauntlets enable him to trade blows with Spider-Man.

Around the year 2000 ([[real time (media)#Comic books and strips|real time]]), Herman Schultz began upgrading the abilities of his costume and weapons. His suit now contains a number of built-in shock units, which throw up a protective vibrational field when triggered by accompanying motion detectors. Besides deflecting most physical blows, this makes it difficult, if not impossible for someone to physically assault or grasp him by surprise. This power upgrade was accompanied by a much bulkier and more protective looking costume (as designed by artist [[John Romita, Jr.]]).

He also recently allowed Hammer Industries to drastically upgrade the power of his gauntlets. However, not trusting to share the whole of his secrets (and thus become what he perceives as expendable), he refused Hammer's technicians access to his actual costume, which (at least at the time) likely wasn't providing him with thorough protection from the feedback of the upgraded gauntlets (he cited nosebleeds as a risk he was willing to take).

Shocker has since appeared repeatedly in his original costume and minus the redesigned super-gauntlets provided to him by Hammer Industries. Whether or not this means he has found a way to retain his upgraded abilities in his old costume or whether he no longer uses them remains in question.

===Personality===
While most Spider-Man villains usually shift from their original goals to a vendetta against Spider-Man, the Shocker is still concerned largely with making a living and protecting his reputation. As such, the character is usually portrayed as behaving in a more professional manner than the majority of his maniacal peers.<ref>''The Superior Foes of Spider-Man'' #16</ref>

Shocker has a notably rational personality among Spider-Man's enemies. He has often been shown to recognize his own limitations amongst a universe of super-powered individuals. He was once stricken with chronic anxiety and paranoia (in the ''Deadly Foes of Spider-Man'' series) stemming from his fears about being targeted by anti-heroes Scourge and the Punisher (surprisingly, he has survived encounters with both). While partnered with the Trapster, he mentions that he engages in [[psychotherapy]].

In recent stories ("Venomous" and "Senseless Violence"), Shocker has revealed that he is extremely frustrated with his place in life, not wanting to be known as a punching bag for superheroes like Spider-Man. He unsuccessfully attempts to purchase the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] at an auction to gain some respect. When temporarily partnered with Hydro-Man, he rebukes Morrie's suggestion that they go kill Spider-Man, being far more interested in more financially lucrative ventures and trying to rebuild a professional reputation.

==Other characters named Shocker==
===Dalt Kendall===
'''Dalt Kendall''' was a brilliant scientist who was obsessed with [[electric eel]]s. He began breeding a pair of gigantic electric eels in his secret lab, slowly exposing himself to their electricity. Over time his body developed an immunity to electricity and the ability to discharge electricity at will. Using his new powers, he began a life of crime, calling himself the Shocker. [[Madeline Joyce]] witnessed his first robbery and in her costumed identity of [[Miss America (Madeline Joyce)|Miss America]], attempted to apprehend the Shocker. Shocker managed to evade capture several times before Miss America finally discovered the entrance to his secret lab. Once he discovered she was in his hideout, Shocker began to divulge the source of his powers before taking the opportunity to attack the heroine. Miss America then tricked him into thinking she was unconscious and struck back at him, punching him into his pet eel aquarium. Somehow, the eel's electricity killed him while unconscious even though he had the ability to harmlessly absorb their electricity otherwise.<ref>''Miss America Magazine'' #2 (November 1944)</ref>

===Randall Darby===
{{main|Randall Darby}}
Randall Darby is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who took the Shocker codename after being recruited by [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] to become a member of his [[Brotherhood of Mutants]],<ref>''Captain America Annual'' #4</ref> but after Magneto abandoned him, Darby changes his code name to Paralyzer.<ref>''Captain America'' #343</ref>

==Other versions==
===''Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows''===
During the "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline in the pages of ''[[Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows]]'', Shocker appears as an enforcer of [[List of Marvel Comics characters: R#Regent|Regent]] where he is seen assisting Boomerang and Rhino in beating up [[Demolition Man (comics)|Demolition Man]]. He later appears as a member of the Sinister Six when they are tasked to hunt down Spider-Man.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''JLA/Avengers''===
In ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'', the Shocker is among the mind-controlled villains who attack the heroes as they assault [[Krona (comics)|Krona]]'s stronghold. He is defeated by the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]].<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #4</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] incarnation of Shocker is 33-year-old petty crook Herman Schultz who raids money transports.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #8</ref> He wears a purple trench coat and a pair of goggles to protect his eyes. He used to work at [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Industries]] and invented his weapons there.<ref name="Ultimate Spider-Man #122">''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #122</ref> He was fired later and then became the Shocker to "get what he deserves" for all the work he has done. He is not especially dangerous and has fought [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Man]] five times in the first 100 issues. During several, there was an unusual factor: Spider-Man wearing the black suit,<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #35</ref> or the presence of [[Kitty Pryde]],<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #112</ref> or [[Wolverine (Ultimate Marvel character)|Wolverine]] putting Shocker at a disadvantage.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #67</ref> Ultimately, he suffers five embarrassing defeats. Thus, he perpetually ends up in jail and his equipment is confiscated. However, he somehow manages to get a new set every time he escapes. It was shown in ''[[Ultimate Marvel Team-Up]]'' that he does make new vibration units in the machine shop of the prison. It is also implied that he isn't always [[indictment|charged]] with anything; Spider-Man simply leaves him at the crime scene. This was noted in their encounter in the second annual when [[Foggy Nelson]] advised Spider-Man to hand him over to the police rather than leave him on the ground.{{issue|date=June 2012}} He is seen in the annual being dropped off at a police station while crying.{{issue|date=June 2012}} He gets some measure of revenge, where he unexpectedly defeats, captures, and tortures Spider-Man, and relays his background. He studied at MIT vigorously and eventually secured a job at Roxxon Industries creating high-end weaponry before being cheated out of his work and earnings. With Spider-Man as his only outlet for rage, he proceeds to assault him before once again being arrested by the authorities led by NYPD's Captain Frank Quaid after a tip from Kitty and [[Mary Jane Watson]].<ref name="Ultimate Spider-Man #122"/>

===''What If''===
The Shocker has appeared in two different ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' stories:
* In "What If... The Punisher Had Killed Spider-Man?", Shocker is among the group of [[List of Spider-Man enemies|Spider-Man's enemies]] who welcomed the Punisher with a toast for killing the hero. Instead of accepting the toast, Punisher killed all the villains present.<ref>''What If'' vol. 2 #58</ref> 
* In "What If Scarlet Witch Ended the House of M event by saying No More Powers?", after the [[Scarlet Witch]] removed all non-tech based superpowers, Shocker, along with [[MODOK|M.O.D.O.K.]], [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], Stilt-Man and Trapster, broke into Kronos Building to steal the Cosmic Cube from [[Aleksander Lukin]], but he was not present; in his place was the [[Bucky Barnes|Winter Soldier]], who attacked the group.

'''''Runaways''''' is a [[superhero]] [[comic book]] series published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The series features a group of teenagers who discover that their parents are part of an evil crime organization known as "the [[Pride (comics)|Pride]]". Created by [[Brian K. Vaughan]] and [[Adrian Alphona]], the series debuted in July [[2003 in comics|2003]]<ref name="officialsite">{{cite web|url=http://www.marvel.com/universe/Runaways|title=Marvel's official website: Runaways|access-date=2008-11-02}}</ref> as part of Marvel Comics' "[[Tsunami (Marvel Comics)|Tsunami]]" imprint. The series was canceled in September [[2004 in comics|2004]] at issue #18, but due to high numbers of trade collection sales, Marvel revived the series in February [[2005 in comics|2005]].

Originally, the series featured a group of six kids whose parents routinely met every year for a charity event. One year, the kids spy on their parents and learn they are "the Pride", a criminal group of mob bosses, time-travelers, wizards, evil scientists, alien invaders and telepathic mutants. The kids steal weapons and resources from their parents and learn that they themselves inherited their parents' powers; [[Alex Wilder]], a prodigy, leads the team while [[Nico Minoru]] learns she is a powerful witch, [[Karolina Dean]] discovers she is an alien, [[Gertrude Yorkes]] learns of her telepathic link to a dinosaur, [[Chase Stein]] steals his father's fistigons (fire gauntlets) and x-ray goggles, and young [[Molly Hayes]] learns she is a mutant with incredible strength. The kids band together and defeat their parents and atone for the sins of their parents by fighting the new threats trying to fill in the Pride's void. Later, they are joined by the cyborg [[Victor Mancha]], the shape-shifting [[Skrull]] [[Xavin]], and the plant-manipulator [[Klara Prast]].

Since the original group's introduction, the Runaways have been portrayed as a somewhat dysfunctional yet loving family. Series creators Brian K. Vaughan and Adrian Alphona left the series at issue 24 of the title's second volume, which ended at issue #30. The series was cancelled in November 2009 after issue #14 of Volume 3,<ref name="Hiatus">{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=23068|title=CUP O' Q&A: RUNAWAYS, WAR MACHINE & MORE!|last=Quesada |first=Joe |date=2009-09-25 |publisher=comicbookresources.com |access-date=2009-10-21}}</ref> but the characters have been seen in other comics.

A live-action adaptation of the series was in development for several years, leading to the [[Runaways (TV series)|''Runaways'' television series]] set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]. It debuted on [[Hulu]] in 2017.

When [[Alex Wilder|Alex]], [[Chase Stein|Chase]], [[Gertrude Yorkes|Gert]], [[Karolina Dean|Karolina]], [[Molly Hayes|Molly]], and [[Nico Minoru|Nico]] witness their parents ("[[Pride (comics)|The Pride]]") sacrifice a girl in an occult ceremony, the group runs off.<ref name="runv1#1"/> As the story progresses, the children learn of their heritage and abilities, and steal resources from their parents, including futuristic gauntlets, a dinosaur, and a mystical Staff. Using these resources, they manage to remove their parents, who were aided by their benefactors, the Gibborim, from their criminal hold of [[Los Angeles]]. Alex, concealing his true loyalty to his parents, betrays the other Runaways to the Pride; in the final battle with the Pride, Alex is incinerated by the Gibborim.<ref name="runawayshcreview">{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/643/643014p1.html|title=Marvel's next generation of superheroes kick things off in grand fashion.|last=George|first=Rich|date=2008-10-14|publisher=IGN|access-date=2009-01-01}}</ref>

The reunited Runaways later formed an uneasy alliance with [[Daken]] in order to take down Marcus Roston, a superpowered criminal with ties to the Pride. Then they appeared again at the ''[[Avengers Academy]]'' asking for help in finding Old Lace, who has been banished into a secret dimension.<ref>{{cite web |last=Richards |first=Dave |url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=34865 |title= NYCC: Gage Offers the Runaways Shelter at "Avengers Academy" |publisher=Comic Book Resources|date=2011-10-16 |access-date=2011-10-18}}</ref>

The Runaways partially disbanded afterwards, with Victor joining [[Hank Pym]]'s [[Avengers A.I.]] team while Nico and Chase were both captured by [[Arcade (comics character)|Arcade]] and forced to fight for their lives in ''[[Avengers Arena]]'', later joining other teen superheroes who survived Arcade's games in ''[[Avengers Undercover]]''. After Nico's brutal death, dismemberment, and subsequent resurrection in ''Avengers Arena'', she is traumatized and has a hard time assimilating back with the Runaways. Chase seemed fine by his experiences in MurderWorld and relished his newfound fame. Chase returned to take care of Karolina, Molly, and Klara.<ref name="Avengers Undercover #1"/> By the end of ''Avengers Undercover'', however, the Runaways seem to be together once again.<ref>''Avengers Undercover'' #10</ref> Some time after the events of Avengers Undercover, Nico joins the [[A-Force]] before returning to Los Angeles.<ref>''A-Force'' v2 #1</ref> After Victor's time with the Avengers A.I., he is recruited to work with Vision and moves in with him and his family in DC in The Vision (2015).<ref>''The Vision'' #8</ref>

Some time later, Chase used the Yorkes time machine to go back in time and save Gert before she was killed by Geoffrey Wilder. The plan partially works but Gert is still gravely injured. Nico managed to heal her and they went in search of the past members of the team in the hopes of reforming. Karolina had become a college student, living off her parents' royalties and in a relationship with [[Lightspeed (comics)|Lightspeed]] from Power Pack, and Molly went to live with her grandmother and study middle school. Both turned down the offer to rejoin the team, but Gert accepted, becoming Molly's adopted sister living under her grandmother's rule. The pieces of Victor Mancha had been sent by the Avengers to Chase, and he managed to reactive him thereby triggering the "Victorious" program but not completely rebuild him.<ref name="runv5#3">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Rainbow Rowell]] | Penciller =  Kris Anka | Inker = Matthew Wilson | Story = Find Your Way Home | Title = Runaways | Volume = 5 | Issue = 3 | Date = November 8, 2017 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>  After rescuing Molly and Gert from her mad scientist grandmother's house, the team reformed and began to live on a derelict underground Pride Hostel, with Nico and Chase magically becoming Molly's legal guardians.<ref name="runv5#7">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Rainbow Rowell]] | Penciller =  Kris Anka | Inker = Matthew Wilson | Story = Best Friends Forever | Title = Runaways | Volume = 5 | Issue = 7 | Date = March 21, 2018 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}''Runaways (2017)'' Volume 5 #7</ref> Romance blossomed between Nico and Karolina and between Gert and Victor.<ref>''Runaways (2017)'' #12</ref>

Alex Wilder, reappeared to warn Runaways of an impending danger in the form of Seed of the Gibborim, a trio of gods and descendants of the Gibborim that their parents tried to summon with a ritual. They tried to get the team to continue their families' ritual, leaving one of the trio – Gib – to watch over them. On the day the ritual was supposed to take place, Gib betrayed the Seed. The two remaining gods were sent into the future to stop their threat. Gib joined the team while Alex was cast out as his former teammates did not trust him.

They were recruited to join a resurrected J-Team, given costumes and support to become official heroes. However, Gert later discovered that Doc Justice, the man who helped them, was simply trying to keep a brand going and had plans to sacrifice Karolina in order to boost his ratings, as he had done many times before. The team fought Doc Justice and, having defeated him, was about to walk away but Old Lace killed Doc and offered his soul to Gib.

===Spin-off===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
[[Loners (comics)|Excelsior]] was a support group consisting of former teenage superheroes from defunct Marvel comic series (though one of their members – [[Julie Power|Lightspeed]] – was and remains a cast member of a financially and critically successful series of [[Power Pack]] books aimed at younger readers). Excelsior was founded by Mickey Musashi ([[Turbo (comics)|Turbo]] of the [[New Warriors]]) and [[Phil Urich]] (the heroic former [[Green Goblin]]), and the group's stated goals were to help fellow/former teenage superheroes to adjust to normal lives and dissuade other super-powered teenagers from becoming heroes, though this rationale (and by extension the team themselves) was made redundant by the events of ''[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]'' (in which it became a legal requirement for all U.S. resident superheroes in the Marvel universe to register with the United States government for training, or face imprisonment).  Though they originally debuted under the name "Excelsior", the title of the spin-off series was changed from ''Excelsior'' to ''Loners,'' due to copyright issues, as [[Stan Lee]] holds a trademark on the term "Excelsior!"<ref name="lyinginthegutter">{{cite news | author = Rich Johnston | title = Lying in the Gutter | publisher = [[Comic Book Resources]] | url = http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=15310| access-date=2006-09-28| author-link = Rich Johnston }}</ref><ref>[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/06/05/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-158/ Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #158], [[Comic Book Resources]], June 5, 2008</ref>  The team do not refer to themselves as "The Loners", however, as this is not the name of the group within their story.

In May 2008, a film version of the comic was in the scripting process, with [[Brian K.

In March 2013, Kevin Feige said during an interview that they elected not to make the film, but that Drew Pearce had been reassigned to ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' on the strength of his ''Runaways'' script.

==Fictional team biography==
The team is founded by the Avenger [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] in response to a suggestion by fellow Avenger, the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], who at the time (as team chairman) wished to expand the Avengers' influence.

After a trip to [[Hungary]] to investigate a report on Pym's second wife, the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], the [[Scarlet Witch]], and the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] assist the team. Mockingbird, Tigra and Moon Knight leave the team together as a new short lived team called the Ex-WACOs over the Avengers rule of not killing in regards to Mockingbird's encounter with Phantom Rider. The Vision and the Scarlet Witch join the team as to not leave it short handed.<ref>{{Cite comic |writer = Englehart, Steve|penciller = Milgrom, Al|inker = Machlan, Mike|story = Avengers Disassemble!|title = West Coast Avengers|volume =2|issue = #37|date = October 1988}}</ref> Former Avenger ally [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]] makes a brief appearance. Agents from multiple governments then abduct the Vision and dismantle him due to his return to the team. The Avengers recover the parts and Dr. Pym rebuilds the Vision but with a chalk-white complexion. Wonder Man, however, does not allow his brain patterns to be used again to provide a matrix for the Vision's emotions, explaining that the original process, done without his consent, had "ripped out his soul". Although Wonder Man's own love for the Scarlet Witch leads him to feel guilt, he justifies his actions by claiming the Vision was never anything but a copy of him, a claim that a number of other Avengers, including the Wasp, accept. This, along with damage to the Vision's synthetic skin when he was dismantled, results in the synthezoid's resurrection as a colorless and emotionless artificial human.<ref>DeFalco "1980s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 240: "Writer/artist John Byrne produced the story arc that came to be known as 'Vision Quest' that ran through ''The West Coast Avengers'' #42–45."</ref><ref>{{cite comic|writer= [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]]|penciller= Byrne, John|inker= Machlan, Mike|story= One of Our Androids is Missing!|title= West Coast Avengers|volume= 2|issue= #42|date= March 1989}}<br>{{cite comic|writer= Byrne, John|penciller= Byrne, John|inker= Machlan, Mike|story= VisionQuest|title= West Coast Avengers|volume= 2|issue= #43|date= April 1989}}<br>{{cite comic|writer= Byrne, John|penciller= Byrne, John|inker= Machlan, Mike|story= Better a Widow...|title= West Coast Avengers|volume= 2| issue= #44|date= May 1989}}</ref> The unstable [[U.S. Agent (comics)|U.S. Agent]] is assigned to the team as a watchdog by the US government to monitor the team's activities.

Iron Man rejoins, and the mutant [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] assists the team when the Scarlet Witch aligns herself with their father [[Magneto(comics)|Magneto]] during a period in which she suffers from a mental breakdown. Immortus is finally confronted and revealed to be the cause of much of the team's misfortune, and is finally defeated. Hank Pym, the Wasp and Quicksilver then leave the team, with [[Machine Man]] becoming reservists and [[Julia Carpenter|Spider-Woman]] and the [[Living Lightning]] joining as full-time members.

The team battle Ultron and his new creation [[Alkhema]] several times, and Hawkeye assumes his old identity of [[Goliath (Marvel Comics)|Goliath]], during the [[Avengers (Marvel Comics)|Avengers]] crossover Operation: Galactic Storm, and reconciles with Mockingbird. Iron Man and Wonder Man leave the team, and are replaced by [[War Machine]] (Jim Rhodes, one of the founding West Coast Avengers) and [[Darkhawk]], with the latter acting as a reservist. During a battle with the demons Mephisto and [[Satannish]], Mockingbird is killed.<ref>Manning, Matthew K.

Several members of the West Coast team—including a returned Iron Man—are unhappy about the decision and leave to form another team, called [[Force Works]].<ref>Manning "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 269: "When the West Coast Avengers disbanded, some of its members. led by Iron Man, went on to form a new team, Force Works."</ref> This team, however, has several setbacks and quickly disbands, with the members returning to the main Avengers team.

Years later, the West Coast Avengers compound would be reopened as the new campus for the [[Avengers Academy]] following the destruction of the Infinite Avengers Mansion as seen in the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= [[Christos Gage|Gage, Christos]]|penciller= [[Tom Raney|Raney, Tom]]|inker= [[Scott Hanna|Hanna, Scott]]|story= Endings|title= [[Avengers Academy]]|issue= #20|date= December 2011}}</ref>

During the [[Fresh Start (comics)|Fresh Start]] relaunch, both Hawkeyes – team founder Clint Barton and his successor [[Hawkeye (Kate Bishop)|Kate Bishop]] – decided to revive the West Coast Avengers following an attack by land sharks in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]]. For that, they recruited America Chavez and Kate's boyfriend Johnny "Fuse" Watts, who helped in the mission, and were eventually joined by Gwenpool and Kid Omega. Given their lack of funds, the newly formed team tried to get financiers by starring in a [[reality show]] following their exploits.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= [[Kelly Thompson|Thompson, Kelly]]|penciller= [[Stefano Caselli|Caselli, Stefano]]|story=|title=West Coast Avengers|volume=3|issue=#1|date=August 2018}}</ref>

The team was assigned to kill a wanted terrorist until Wonder Man went unstable. This forced the abandonment of the mission and [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] put the team into stasis until needed. Fury and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] had planned to use them against the villainous [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] and his Children of Tomorrow, but thanks to the civil war, California Governor Ford discovered the newly christened '''West Coast Ultimates''' and set them against the Ultimates.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Humphries, Sam|penciller= Bennett, Joe|inker= Jose, Ruy|title= Ultimate Comics: The Ultimates|issue= #23|date= June 2013}}</ref>

The first adaption of Merlin first appeared in a [[King Arthur]] based comic book story in the [[anthology]] comic book series entitled originally ''New Comics'' (later re-titled ''[[Adventure Comics]]'') in issue #3 in Feb. 1936 by Rafael Astarita, kicking off a six-issue adaptation of "[[Le Morte d'Arthur#Book IV: "The Tale of Sir Gareth of Orkney" (Caxton VII)|The Tale of Sir Gareth of Orkney]]" by [[Thomas Malory|Sir Thomas Malory]].<ref>http://www.camelot4colors.com/retell.htm#"King Arthur, New Comics" #3-8</ref> He was also one of the earliest appeared recurring characters in a DC Comics title appearing only slightly after [[Doctor Occult]] and before [[Slam Bradley]] and [[Superman]].

In a [[Superboy]] story, he appears as a scientist of [[King Arthur (DC Comics)|King Arthur]]'s time who looks like [[Mister Mxyzptlk|Mr. Mxyzptlk]], but also has the gift of Second Sight.<ref>''Superboy'' #103</ref>

The first modern version of Merlin is linked to his appearance in ''[[Etrigan the Demon|The Demon]]'' #1 (Sept. 1972). In this series, Merlin summons the demon Etrigan to combat [[Morgaine le Fey (DC Comics)|Morgaine le Fey]], and appears in several more issues of the series. These events are shown from a different point of view in ''[[Madame Xanadu]]'' vol. 2 #1 (Aug. 2008), a [[Vertigo Comics]] title. In ''The Demon'' vol. 2 #1 (April 1987), Merlin is established as Etrigan's half-demon brother and subsequent uses of the character have followed this back story.

Merlin is the half-demon son of the demon Belial and an unknown human woman and the younger half-brother of the demons Lord Scapegoat and Etrigan. His very first appearance has him serving his traditional [[Tutelary deity|tutelary]] role to [[King Arthur in comics#(DC Comics)|King Arthur]] in [[Camelot]], alongside [[Lancelot]], [[Guinevere]], and [[Gareth]].<ref>''New Comics'' #3 (Feb. 1936)</ref>

Merlin had further adventures in King Arthur's court. He gave a magical suit of armor (which protects its wearer from all forms of harm) and a sword (capable of cutting any substance except the aforementioned suit), as well as a winged horse named Victory to the [[Shining Knight]].<ref>''Adventure Comics'' #66 (Sept. 1941)</ref> He also guided squire Brian Kent, the young man who became the [[Silent Knight]].<ref>''Brave and the Bold'' #1 (Aug. 1955)</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=silentknight |title=The Unofficial Silent Knight Biography |website=www.dcuguide.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050220110715/http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=silentknight |archive-date=2005-02-20}}</ref>

Merlin's father Belial had him trained in the arts of sorcery so that he could use his powers to control his older brother Etrigan. As a result, Merlin traveled far and wide on the [[Physical plane|mortal plane]], studying various schools of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. Eventually he became learned enough to bind his brother, and was responsible for binding [[Etrigan the Demon|Etrigan]] to the body and soul of the [[druid]] Iason, who would later be known as Jason Blood. Merlin employed the now-controllable demon in the defense of Camelot, against his nemesis [[Morgaine le Fey (DC Comics)|Morgaine le Fey]], her army of demons, and her son [[Mordred]]. Before Morgaine le Fey's attack, Merlin subdued his other brother Lord Scapegoat and the Thing-That-Cannot-Die, banishing them to the '''Region Beyond''', and set [[Sir Percival]] the Golden Knight to guard the Region's exit, which is located in [[England]]. The Region Beyond, possibly located in the Infernal Province known as the Labyrinth, is where King Arthur had Merlin banish all the dangerous mystical entities native to [[Great Britain]].

Etrigan was able to defeat Morgaine le Fey and her demon army, and Arthur slew Mordred. But the [[Phantom Stranger]] made sure that the fall of Camelot could not be prevented, by arranging Merlin's ensorcellment by his student [[Nimue|Nimue Inwudu]] ([[Madame Xanadu]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mykey3000.com/cosmicteams/profiles/demon.html |title=The Demon |access-date=2010-01-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101124405/http://www.mykey3000.com/cosmicteams/profiles/demon.html |archive-date=2010-01-01}}</ref><ref>''Madame Xanadu'' vol. 2 #1 (Aug. 2008)</ref> Merlin eventually escapes this fate and has appeared elsewhere in DC Comics, living an immortal existence throughout the centuries and aiding various heroes.

In the Pre-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]]'' DC Comics universe, Merlin possessed a magical crystal ball which he allowed the [[Justice League of America]] to keep after they helped him to defeat a trio of evil sorcerers. This Merlin comes from the alternate world of Magic-Land, where scientific laws do not apply, but magic does. This self-same crystal ball was used a short time later to communicate across dimensions with the [[Justice Society of America]] of Earth-Two. Both teams of heroes coordinated their efforts to defeat a group of villains known as the "Crime Champions".<ref>''[[Justice League of America]]'' #2 (Jan. 1961)</ref> In another story Superboy, when travelling through time to find a red kryptonite meteor, meets Merlin, who looks like Mr. Mxyzptlk. Merlin here uses an early form of science, but shows he is able to see into the future.

Other artifacts once owned by Merlin have shown up all over the DC Universe. A time traveler named Lord Satanis and his wife Syrene both sought the "[[Runestone]] of Merlin", and manipulated Superman in pursuit of it.<ref>''Action Comics'' #527 (Jan. 1982)</ref> The "[[Book of Eternity (comics)|Book of Eternity]]", which was Merlin's book of spells, is currently wielded by Selma Tolon of [[Turkey]], an adventurer who calls herself the "[[Janissary]]".<ref>The book first appeared in ''The Demon'' #1 (Aug. 1972).</ref><ref>''JLA'' Annual #4 (Summer 2000)</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=janissary |title=The Unofficial Janissary Biography |website=www.dcuguide.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061225034841/http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=janissary |archive-date=2006-12-25}}</ref> The [[Philosopher's Stone]] was the magical focus used by Merlin to bond the druid Iason to the demon Etrigan.

In the [[Vertigo Comics]] miniseries ''The Names of Magic'', [[Timothy Hunter]] encounters a version of Merlin still trapped under an enchanted sleep in a cave in [[Cornwall]]. Merlin explains that Tim is his creation, a spiritual successor to the title of "the Merlin" (a living conduit of magic). He created Tim with multiple contradictory origins to enhance his legend. This Merlin's connection to the mainstream DC Comics version is unclear, though it would seem that like Tim, Merlin is also a living legend of contradictory histories. In addition to sleeping in the cave, the series claims that aspects of Merlin are trapped in a [[Brocéliande|forest in France]], under a hill in [[Wales]], and on an island in an invisible house of glass. In the subsequent ongoing series ''[[Hunter: The Age of Magic]]'', Merlin's spirit manifests through Tim's owl, Yoyo, and becomes the boy's teacher, until his body is slain by the Brotherhood of the Cold Flame and his spirit passes on.

As of the ''[[Trials of Shazam]]'' maxiseries, the aspect of Merlin still free in the world now exhibits a visible demonic aspect and goes by his [[Welsh people|Welsh]] name "Myrddin". He has also revealed the existence of several half-demon children sired and tutored by him. These descendants refer to themselves collectively as the "Council of Merlin". His favored daughter Sabina, a Creole witch, recently failed in her bid for the power of Shazam, which would have made her his anchor to Earth, and was instead killed when drawn into a portal in a battle with Freddy Freeman by [[Zeus (DC Comics)|Zeus]].<ref>''The Trials of Shazam!'' #12 (May 2008)</ref>

In ''[[The New 52]]'', Merlin makes his debut in ''Demon Knights'' #1, again as the magician of King Arthur's court and is responsible for [[Etrigan the Demon]] and Jason Blood merging.<ref>''Demon Knights'' #1</ref> Years later, he was killed by a daemonite-controlled disciple in the city of Alba Sarum.<ref>''Demon Knights'' #8</ref> However, the Demon Knights, although betrayed by Etrigan, are able to bring his body to Avalon, resurrecting the magician, who then uses his mystical powers to help defeat the invading forces of [[Lucifer (DC Comics)|Lucifer]] and Queen Questing.<ref>''Demon Knights'' #15</ref>
In the present, Merlin is called Adam One and is the leader of [[Stormwatch (comics)|Stormwatch]],<ref>''Stormwatch'' #1</ref> but is eventually replaced and, by the words of the Shadow Cabinet's emissary, clinically killed since this is the only way to enter the Cabinet's dimension.<ref>''Stormwatch'' #5</ref> He later appears to Jenny Quantum in a dream and explains to her the team's origins.<ref>''Stormwatch'' #0</ref> Later, in ''Stormwatch'' #19, extra-dimensional aliens kill Adam One at the moment of creation, averting the Demon Knights' backstory for Stormwatch and effectively rebooting the entire comic book.

In the [[Elseworlds]] story ''Batman: Dark Knight of the Round Table'', Merlin counsels a [[Round Table]] made up of setting appropriate analogs of the [[Justice League of America]].

==Marvel Comics==
Merlin is the name of multiple fictional characters appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

The first Merlin of the Marvel Universe is apparently the figure of [[Arthurian legend]], hailing from 6th century A.D. Britain. He was born in Carmarthen, Wales. He was a powerful sorcerer who acted as teacher, adviser, and defender of [[King Arthur (Marvel Comics)|King Arthur Pendragon]] of [[Camelot]]. Merlin warned King Arthur that his son, [[Mordred (comics)|Mordred]] would be responsible for the end of Camelot, but before Arthur could put the baby to death, he was rescued and raised in anonymity. Merlin was responsible for teaching magic to [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]], though she turned against him and became one of King Arthur's greatest foes.

Knowing that Britain would need a champion to face the likes of Mordred and Morgan, he sought a boy to become the first [[Black Knight (Sir Percy)|Black Knight]]. He had this boy, Percy, trained in all known forms of combat, and when he grew up, Sir Percy was presented with the [[Ebony Blade]].<ref>''Black Knight Comics'' #1</ref>

When [[Kang the Conqueror|Kang]] traveled back to the days of Camelot, Merlin was defeated and imprisoned by Kang, who planned to change history. Merlin defeated Kang, however, with the aid of time travelers the [[Human Torch]] and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] who the Watcher had transported back in time.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #134</ref>

Merlin cast a spell over the dying Sir Percy so that he would have successors in future centuries.<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes'' #17</ref>

Merlin was finally placed in suspended animation within an enchanted cave by the faerie sorceress Nimue.<ref>As revealed in ''Iron Man'' #150.</ref> His spirit continued to appear in astral form and advise the original Black Knight, but he was no longer seen in his physical body.

It was later depicted how Merlin magically imprisoned Morgan le Fay within her castle.<ref>''Iron Man'' #209</ref>

Merlin allied with St. Brendan against the [[Darkhold]]'s power.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 3 #11</ref>

Later was revealed further information about Merlin's alliance with the original Black Knight and imprisonment of Morgan.<ref>''Black Knight'' #1-2</ref>

It was also depicted how Merlin banished [[Tyrannus (comics)|Tyrannus]] to [[Subterranea (comics)|Subterranea]].<ref>''The Avengers'' Annual #10</ref>

Other beings have also claimed the name Merlin, besides the Merlin of Arthurian legend:

This being was apparently 10,000 years old, and apparently was a savage that came to possess some portion of the same Bloodgem that [[Ulysses Bloodstone]] would later possess, which gave him immortality and eternal youth. He later came to Britain during the time of Camelot, and impersonated the real Merlin while he was away. The [[Eternal (comics)|Eternal]] [[Sersi]] exposed the impostor, and the real Merlin placed him in suspended animation.

The false Merlin was revived in modern times after his coffin was found, attacked [[Washington, D.C.]], and fought [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].<ref>''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #96 (Sept. 1963)</ref> Thor imprisoned him back inside the coffin he was found in after pretending to be a powerful shapeshifter and ordering Merlin to go back into suspended animation. He later took the name '''Warlock''', and fought the [[X-Men]].<ref name="x30">''X-Men'' #30</ref> He later fought the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], the [[Hulk]], and the [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] under the name '''Maha Yogi'''.<ref>''X-Men'' #47</ref> During his encounter with the Hulk, his fragment of the Bloodgem was destroyed and he rapidly aged into helplessness.

He claimed to be a mutant,<ref name="x30" /> later [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]]ned as having been altered by aliens<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/merlinds.htm ''Doctor Strange'' vol. III #27]</ref> and had the ability to control the minds of others, create illusions, project force bolts, levitate objects, teleport himself, create force fields and alter his own appearance.

Another being posing as Merlin was sent by [[Immortus]] to fight the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. This being was revealed to be a shapechanging [[Dire Wraith]] with absolutely no connection to the real Merlin.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

The being [[Merlyn (Marvel Comics)|Merlyn]] also claims to be the real Merlin and appears to be a gestalt of the various other Merlins within the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Marvel Multiverse]].{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Peter Hunter, the British costumed champion known as Albion, a member of the [[Knights of Pendragon]], is alleged to be the current reincarnation of Merlin.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Merlin also appeared in the [[Marvel UK]] [[Doctor Who Magazine|''Doctor Who'' comic]] appearing first in "The Neutron Knights"<ref>''Doctor Who Monthly'' #60 (Jan. 1982)</ref> story and later in the longer "The Tides of Time".<ref>''DWM'' #61-67 (Feb.–Augu. 1982). {{comicbookdb|type=storyarc|id=356|title=Tides of Time}}</ref> This Merlin was one of the High Evolutionaries of the Cosmos, a group that also includes [[Rassilon]], the founder of the [[Time Lords]], which guarded the timestream.

It appears that this Merlin<ref>[http://www.brokenfrontier.com/lowdown/p/detail/mighty-week-of-marvel-5 Mighty Week of Marvel #5] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407020503/http://www.brokenfrontier.com/lowdown/p/detail/mighty-week-of-marvel-5 |date=2012-04-07}}, Broken Frontier, July 15, 2008}</ref> removed a shard of the [[Fury (Marvel Comics)|Fury]] that had embedded itself into Merlyn, the physical amalgamations of all his interdimensional counterparts, while at the same time taking his other counterparts' madness out along with it. This allowed Merlin to take over control away from Merlyn. Merlin, who was imprisoned in a dimension used by [[Otherworld]] fairy king [[Oberon]] to keep evil at bay, was freed by [[Pete Wisdom]] during the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull invasion of Earth]]. Magically reversing the effect of the shard of the Fury, Merlin used it to resurrect [[Captain Britain]] in ''[[Captain Britain and MI: 13]]'' #3.

Merlyn returned in the 2019 run of [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] now calling himself "The Great Hierophant Merlyn", as the ruler of "The Holy Republic of Fae" part of the Foul Courts of Otherworld. His daughter Roma runs "The Floating Kingdom of Roma Regina" in the Fair Courts<ref>''X-Factor'' Vol 4 #4 (September, 2020)</ref> and as shown in an arc in [[New Mutants]] the two aren't on speaking terms.<ref>''New Mutants'' Vol 4 16-17</ref> He becomes a major antagonist in the books final arc when it's revealed he's working with pre-established villains Morgana La Fey and Coven Akkaba, and shares their hatred for "Witchbreed" (mutants). He was working with a returned King Arthur who wanted to take back control of Avalon from acting king [[Jamie Braddock]] with the ulterior motive of wanting to take over Otherworld. He achieves this goal by invading the Starlight Citadel and after forcing Omniversal Majestrix [[Saturnyne]] to retreat with the Captain Britain Corps, renames it the "Lunatic Citadel".<ref>''Excalibur'' Vol 4 24-26</ref> In the final issue it's revealed how his grudge against Saturnyne began. After Otherworld and the Captain Britain Corps were destroyed by the Mapmakers Saturnyne escaped with a captive Mapmaker and they ended up in the future Otherworld province Blightspoke, there she was contacted by Merlyn and Roma in spirit form and made a deal with Roma that she would be rebuild Otherworld with the Mapmakers power and become Omniversal Magestrix in exchange for making the Fair Courts for her to rule and the Foul Courts for her father to rule.<ref>''Excalibur'' Vol 4 26 (December 2021)</ref> Merlyn then becomes the main antagonist of the books sequel series Knights of X ruling Otherworld with an iron fist within the Lunatic Citadel.

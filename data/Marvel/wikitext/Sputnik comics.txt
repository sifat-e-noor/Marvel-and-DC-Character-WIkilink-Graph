The '''Winter Guard''' ({{lang-ru|Зимняя Гвардия|Zimnyaya Gvardiya}}) is a fictional team of [[Russian people|Russian]] [[superhero]]es appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

The Winter Guard are noted for being "Russia's answer to the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]".<ref name="she-hulk34">''She-Hulk'' (vol. 2) #34 (2008). Marvel Comics.</ref> Several members of the group formerly belonged to the [[Soviet Super-Soldiers]], the [[People's Protectorate]] and the [[Supreme Soviets]]. Unlike those teams, which were often adversarial towards other costumed superheroes, the Winter Guard is much more heroic and representative in nature.

Unlike other superhero teams, the Winter Guard currently has a rotating pool of candidates to fill one of three roles on the team: [[Darkstar (Marvel Comics)|Darkstar]], [[Crimson Dynamo]] and [[Red Guardian]].{{fact|date=April 2021}}

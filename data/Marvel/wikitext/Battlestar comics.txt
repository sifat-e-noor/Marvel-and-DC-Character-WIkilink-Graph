'''Battlestar''' ('''Lemar Hoskins''') is a <!--Do not add "fictional" as it is tautological; superheroes (and characters in general) are by definition implied to be fictionalized to some extent.-->[[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He became the fifth character to assume the alias '''[[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|Bucky]]''' before taking on the name "Battlestar".

[[Clé Bennett]] portrayed the character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] television series ''[[The Falcon and the Winter Soldier]]'' (2021).

==Publication history==
Battlestar was created by [[Mark Gruenwald]] and [[Paul Neary]], and was originally introduced as a nameless member of the Bold Urban Commandos in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #323. In ''Captain America'' #327 he is called "Lemar" for the first time, but generally is still treated as interchangeable with the other BUCs. He rises from anonymity in ''Captain America'' #334, in which his full name is revealed and he adopts the identity of Bucky. Gruenwald later explained:

{{quote|I get several letters every month asking when Bucky's coming back. And I said, "Well, if the government's getting a new Captain America, maybe they'd want to get a new Bucky." I had previously introduced three Buckies as the friends and partners of [[U.S. Agent (comics)|the Super-Patriot]], the Bold Urban Commandos, and rather than create someone new, I decided one of them would be ''the'' Bucky. There were two white guys and a black guy, and I said why not the black guy. He at least stood out in the group. Cap had a black partner before in the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], but he's had three other white partners so I said it's time for another black one. Thus, Bucky was black. Now I'm getting a lot of bad mail, and deservedly so, for my ignorance.<ref name="DAK54">{{Cite news |last=Zimmerman |first=Dwight Jon |date=January 1988 |title=Mark Gruenwald |pages=5–23 |work=[[Comics Interview]] |publisher=[[Fictioneer Books]] |issue=54}}</ref>|author=|title=|source=}}

Writer [[Dwayne McDuffie]] informed Gruenwald that "Buck" is considered a derogatory term among African-Americans, as it was a term used before the [[American Civil War]] to refer to male slaves, and said that it was also racially offensive to have an adult black man taking on the identity of a teenage sidekick.<ref>{{Cite web |date=June 15, 2018 |title=Comic Legends: How Dwayne McDuffie Saved Captain America From Racism |url=https://www.cbr.com/captain-america-dwayne-mcduffie-racism/ |access-date=November 29, 2019 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref>  Writer Mark Gruenwald had not known of the racial connotation of "Bucky", having grown up in a region with very few African-Americans,<ref name="DAK54" /> and worked with McDuffie to create a story to address the problem and give Hoskins a new name.

In ''Captain America'' #341 he is renamed Battlestar, dons his own unique costume, and is more explicitly presented as a partner to the new Captain America, rather than a sidekick.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=45}}</ref> Gruenwald recalled, "The search for a good name for a partner to Cap is a whole half-hour unto itself. ''[laughs]'' We came up with ''every'' single name which was vaguely patriotic, vaguely military, and yet stood on its own, because some day these guys may split up."<ref name="DAK54" /> The name "Battlestar" was ultimately suggested by ''Captain America'' penciler [[Kieron Dwyer]].<ref name="DAK54" />

==Fictional character biography==
'''Lemar Hoskins''' was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. Along with his [[United States Army|Army]] buddies [[U.S. Agent (comics)|John Walker]], [[Left-Winger (comics)|Hector Lennox]], and [[Right-Winger (comics)|Jerome Johnson]], he is given superhuman strength by Dr. [[Karl Malus]] on behalf of the [[Power Broker (character)|Power Broker]], and they become wrestlers.<ref>{{Cite book |last=DeFalco |first=Tom |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-7566-2358-6 |page=31}}</ref> The four later form the Bold Urban Commandos (also known as the "BUCkies"), and are employed by John Walker, known as the Super-Patriot. The Buckies stage a fake attack on the Super-Patriot for publicity.<ref>''Captain America'' #323 (November 1986). Marvel Comics.</ref> As a BUCky, Hoskins also attacks a group of foreign students.<ref>''Captain America'' #327. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When the Federal [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]] selects Walker to replace Steve Rogers as [[Captain America]], Hoskins is the only one in his group allowed to accompany the new Captain America. He takes the identity of Bucky (after Rogers' original partner [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky]]) and undergoes a rigorous training under the supervision of the Commission. Walker and Hoskins go undercover on a mission to stop [[Watchdogs (Marvel Comics)|the Watchdogs]].<ref>''Captain America'' #334 (October 1987). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Hoskins, who is [[African American]], is persuaded by another [[Black people|black]] man that "Bucky" is a demeaning title, since American slaveholders often referred to male slaves as "bucks". Consequently, Hoskins takes on the identity of Battlestar, wearing a new costume and wielding a shield patterned after the one Steve Rogers originally carried.<ref>''Captain America'' #341 (May 1988). Marvel Comics.</ref> Captain America and Battlestar capture [[Quill (comics)#Quill (Resistants)|Quill]] but are defeated in combat by Quill's team, the [[Resistants]].

Battlestar confronts and fights the [[U.S. Agent (comics)|U.S. Agent]].  Battlestar is captured by the [[Power Tools (comics)|Power Tools]]. Dr. Karl Malus employs the Power Tools to collect previous clients of Power Broker Inc., so that Malus can perform tests upon them. Malus subjects Battlestar to the de-augmentation process. Subsequently, Hoskins fights the Power Broker and his superhuman strength is restored by Malus. Hoskins then reconciles with U.S. Agent.<ref>''Captain America'' #372–378 (July 1990 – October 1990). Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Steve Rogers resumes the identity of Captain America, Battlestar leaves federal employment and returns to his native Chicago. He becomes a member of [[Silver Sable]]'s [[Wild Pack]] for some time.<ref>"''Silver Sable and the Wild Pack'' #3 (August 1992). Marvel Comics.</ref> When Ernst Sablinova, Sable's father, wants the Pack to murder a captive, Battlestar disobeys.<ref>''Silver Sable and the Wild Pack'' #34–35 (March 1995 – April 1995).

Floyd and a few others escape.<ref>''Civil War: Front Line'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> Battlestar suffers a back injury during the battle and due to an oversight, does not receive proper medical care while in custody in Prison 42. He is freed by Captain America's forces and takes part in the final battle, despite his injuries.<ref>''Civil War Battle Damage Report'' one-shot. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Battlestar later returns, working as a security guard for [[Features of the Marvel Universe#Project_Pegasus|Project Pegasus]]. He witnesses a [[zombie]] invasion from a parallel Earth and the return of [[Jack of Hearts (Marvel Comics)|Jack of Hearts]].<ref>''Marvel Zombies: Supreme'' #1–2. Marvel Comics.</ref> He also participated in an [[A.R.M.O.R.]] raid on a parallel Earth, infested by [[Nazi]] zombies, alongside a team of heroes which included [[Dum-Dum Dugan]] and [[Howard the Duck]].<ref>''Marvel Zombies Destroy!'' #1–5.

==Powers and abilities==
As a result of the experimental mutagenic process conducted on him by Karl Malus on behalf of the Power Broker, Lemar Hoskins has superhuman strength. His endurance is also heightened albeit to a lesser degree. His agility and reflexes are of the order of a superior Olympic athlete. Additionally, he possesses superhuman durability and resilience, enabling him to survive high impacts and blows, and in one instance to survive being hanged by the [[Watchdogs (Marvel Comics)|Watchdogs]] (a [[Red Skull]] front group).

Battlestar is highly trained in gymnastics and acrobatics. He is an exceptional hand-to-hand combatant, and received rigorous training in unarmed combat and the use of his shield, in a style similar to the original Captain America, from the [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]].

===Equipment===
He carries a near indestructible blunt-end triangular [[adamantium]] shield in combat, and is capable of using it defensively against kinetic and energy based attacks, and offensively as a missile weapon.

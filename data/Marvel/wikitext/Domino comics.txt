'''Domino''' ('''Neena Thurman''')  is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is best known as a member of the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] team [[X-Force]]. Created by writer [[Fabian Nicieza]]{{cn|date=November 2020}} and artist/co-writer [[Rob Liefeld]], Domino made her first full cover story appearance in ''X-Force'' #8 (March 1992) as an original member of the [[Six Pack (comics)|Wild Pack]] team led by the mutant [[Cable (comics)|Cable]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=115}}</ref>

In addition to her exceptional marksmanship and hand-to-hand skills, Domino possesses mutant [[probability]]-altering powers. She often uses her skills as a mercenary, but has also been the partner, confidante, and love interest of the [[superhero]] Cable, a lieutenant in his militant group X-Force, and a member of the [[X-Men]].

In other media outside comics, Domino has primarily appeared in video games, though she has made minor animated television appearances and a live-action film appearance in ''[[Deadpool 2]]'' (2018), portrayed by [[Zazie Beetz]].

==Publication history==
Apart from being a mainstay character in the first series of ''X-Force'', Domino has had two limited self-titled series, one of which had her teaming with [[Puck (comics)|Puck]] against [[Lady Deathstrike]] and [[Donald Pierce]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=282}}</ref> The second revealed her childhood.

The first female Domino to appear in Marvel comics was not the genuine Neena Thurman. A Domino imposter, a mutant shapeshifter named [[Copycat (Marvel Comics)|Copycat]], first appeared in ''[[The New Mutants (comic book)|The New Mutants]]'' #98 (Feb. 1991), and continued to assume Neena's role in X-Force for a time. The real Domino was first published in the main [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] story recalled by Cable in ''X-Force'' #8 (March  1992). Her current narrative, brief cameo, second appearance was published on the last page of ''X-Force'' #11 (June 1992).

Domino received two self-titled limited series.  The first came in 1997 and ran for 3 issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marvel.com/comics/series/24772/domino_1997|title=Domino (1997)|website=Marvel Entertainment}}</ref> The next ran for four issues in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marvel.com/comics/series/3742/domino_2003|title=Domino (2003)|website=Marvel Entertainment}}</ref> She has also appeared in a number of issues of ''Cable & Deadpool'' (Marvel, 2004/2006 series),<ref>''Cable and Deadpool'' #7–12, 27–29, 33–35, 40–42. Marvel Comics.</ref> and joined the first Wolverine-led X-Force as of ''X-Force'' vol. 3 #8 (Dec. 2008).{{cn|date=June 2019}}

Domino appeared in her own three-issue miniseries with Wolverine entitled ''X-Force: Sex and Violence'', written by [[Christopher Yost]] and [[Craig Kyle]] and drawn by [[Gabriele Dell'Otto]].<ref name="sexandviolence">{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19903|title=NYCC: Yost & Kyle on 'X-Force: Sex and Violence'|last=Manning|first=Shaun|date=2009-02-07|publisher=Comic Book Resources|access-date=2009-06-28}}</ref> The story centers upon Domino and Wolverine's mission to resolve a situation from Domino's recent past.<ref name="sexandviolence"/> Chris Yost has said, "It's a chance for us to go in-depth into a couple of the characters.

Domino starred in her own series again starting in 2018, which led into a limited series in 2019 titled ''Domino: Hotshots'' where she leads an all-female team. These were written by [[Gail Simone]] and drawn by David Baldeon.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dominguez |first1=Noah |title=Marvel Announces All-New, All-Female Team Series |url=https://www.cbr.com/marvel-announces-domino-hotshots/ |website=CBR |access-date=4 June 2019 |date=11 December 2018}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
The woman who would become known as Domino is actually the result of a top-secret government breeding program intended to develop the perfect weapon. Domino was the only test subject to survive, but her "luck" power was deemed a failure at meeting the project's goals. Her biological mother broke her out of the project and left her with Father Rudolpho Boschelli in the Church of the Sacred Heart in [[Chicago]]. 

Domino eventually left the Church and became a mercenary. One of her first jobs was to stop "Operation: Jericho" which was a remote-controlled warbot project. Domino wrecked the robot, but in the process fried the mind of the soldier controlling it. She was then assigned to guard the hard working and innovative Dr. Milo Thurman, whose analytical ability made him too dangerous for the government to let roam free. Somehow, Domino and Thurman fell in love and were married. Due to Thurman's love of Dante's ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', he called Domino "Beatrice". The two separated after a raid on the facility by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]] members, with Milo believing Domino had been killed during the altercation.<ref>''Domino'' #1–3 (Jan.–March 1997). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Six Pack===
Domino helped found the mercenary band [[Six Pack (comics)|Six Pack]], which introduced her to the mutant time-traveler [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. Domino worked with the Six Pack for some time, taking on many missions for cash. The Six Pack was very brutal in their adventures, often shooting down entire crowds of people who got in their way. The team, also known as the Wild Pack, went on missions in [[Iran]],<ref name="Blood&Steel">flashback in ''Cable: Blood and Steel'' #1–2 (Oct.–Nov. 1992). Marvel Comics.</ref> and participated in a raid on a [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] base,<ref>flashback in ''X-Force'' #8 (March  1992). Marvel Comics.</ref> which Domino participated in. During her time with the Wild Pack, she had her first confrontations with [[Stryfe]] (Cable's evil clone) in Afghanistan and Uruguay.<ref name="Blood&Steel"/>

===Replacement===
When Cable became the leader of the New Mutants following their break from the [[X-Men]], a mutant named [[Copycat (Marvel Comics)|Copycat]] impersonated Domino<ref>''The New Mutants'' #98 (Feb. 1991)</ref> and joined as his field leader and stayed with the team as they changed from the New Mutants to X-Force. When it was revealed that the real Domino was actually a prisoner of the [[supervillain]] [[Genesis (Marvel Comics)|Tolliver]] for over a year,<ref>''X-Force'' #11 (June 1992). Marvel Comics.</ref> X-Force rejected Domino's imposter and, with Cable's reassurances, planned to rescue the real Domino and welcome her onto the team.

Meanwhile, the real Domino learned of Tolliver's destruction of X-Force's Adirondack base and planned her escape.<ref>''X-Force'' #13 (Aug. 1992). Marvel Comics.</ref> Cable found her at Tolliver's Italian home, along with her apparently murdered double.<ref>''X-Force'' #14 (Sept. 1992). Marvel Comics.</ref> Domino was accidentally freed by [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]], whom she shot. Cable sent her to find X-Force. She escaped on Tolliver's helicopter and survived a fall from Tolliver's helicopter into the sea.<ref>''X-Force'' #15 (Oct.  1992). Marvel Comics.</ref> She found X-Force and joined the team.

===Joining X-Force===
Domino stayed with the team for most of its existence, becoming its ''[[de facto]]'' leader when Cable left the team on several occasions. For a while, she was a prisoner of the forces of [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]], which severely affected her mentally and physically. During X-Force's existence, Domino had several solo adventures. During one, she was forced to kill her mentally ill, ex–Six Pack partner [[Grizzly (Theodore Winchester)|Grizzly]].<ref>''Cable'' #24 (Oct. 1995). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===X-Corporation===
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2010}}
When X-Force briefly disbanded, Domino joined the [[X-Corporation]].<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 3 #1 (Feb. 2008). Marvel Comics.</ref> While working in their Hong Kong branch, Domino's partner, Risque, was murdered and she summoned the core group of the X-Men to help investigate. Together the mutants uncovered the truth behind John Sublime's "Third Species" movement: he was harvesting body parts from living mutants to create his U-Men. They also helped free the mutant named Xorn.<ref>''New X-Men'' Annual 2001 (Sept. 2001). Marvel Comics.</ref>

During her solo period, Domino began to search for her mother, Beatrice, and clues to her past. In her search, Domino learned that the "Project: Armageddon", was still active. Led to a secret base in Florida, Domino finds a mutant boy named Lazarus who had the same eye tattoo. Lazarus imprisoned Domino there for observation.<ref>''Domino'' vol. 2 #4 (Aug. 2003). Marvel Comics.</ref> Lazarus turns out to be her half-brother with powerful emotion controlling abilities and the true result of the Perfect Weapon program.{{issue|date=November 2010}} Soon after attempting to liberate him, a fanatical group of quasi-priests called the Armajesuits, who were against the project, arrive to kill Lazarus and prevent him from reaching his full development. Domino discovers that her mother leads the Armajesuits and is forced to shoot her to save Lazarus's life. She takes Lazarus to Father Boschelli and the Church she was raised in for sanctuary, although unbeknown to her, Beatrice subsequently abducts Lazarus from there.<ref>''Domino'' vol. 2 #1–4 (June–Aug. 2003). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Cable and Deadpool===
Later, she was employed by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] as a member of the new Six Pack. Alongside [[G. W. Bridge]], Hammer, [[Solo (Marvel Comics)|Solo]], [[Anaconda (comics)|Anaconda]], and [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]], she attacked Cable at his community ''Providence'', but she quickly defected to his side after the Six Pack was defeated by Cable and Deadpool. Domino followed Deadpool to Rumekistan, where she assassinated the country's dictator, [[Flag-Smasher]], only to find out it was part of a plan to install Cable as leader of that nation. After a conversation with [[Citizen V]], she then attempted to kill Cable, believing that he would lead them to ruin. <ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #28 (July 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref>

==="Civil War"===
During the 2006 "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" storyline, Domino, [[Shatterstar]] and [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]], under the X-Force name, led an attack on the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]] and broke out more than half of [[X-Men: The 198|the 198]], bringing the tension between the 198 and O*N*E to a head.<ref>''[[Civil War: X-Men]]'' #1 (Sept. 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref> After her other team, the Six Pack disbands, she and Cable are allies on Providence, until a fight with Hecatomb causes the island to sink into the ocean, leaving Cable presumed dead.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

Domino is later recruited by [[G. W. Bridge]] along with [[Silver Sable]] and the Contessa [[Valentina Allegra de Fontaine]] to track down the [[Punisher]]. When a fake Punisher started targeting civilians, she was the only team member to believe in Castle's innocence.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

==Powers and abilities==
Domino is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the ability to subconsciously generate a "psionic aura" that alters the probabilities of events and actions within her line of sight. The aura causes improbable (but not impossible) outcomes that are personally beneficial. The resulting effects of this "subliminal telekinesis" are observed as "good luck" for Domino and "bad luck" for her opponents (from enemy equipment serendipitously malfunctioning to averting imminent catastrophes through seemingly-chance actions).<ref>{{cite web |title=Domino: In Comics Full Report |url=https://www.marvel.com/characters/domino-neena-thurman/in-comics |website=Marvel.com |access-date=13 March 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Austin |first=Michael |date=2020-03-25 |title=X-Men: The 10 Craziest Uses of Domino's Mutant Power, Ranked |url=https://www.cbr.com/xmen-domino-poers-ranked/ |access-date=2022-08-26 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref>

Instead of consciously activating her probability-warping powers, they trigger automatically when Domino faces potential harm, danger, or personal benefit (e.g. engaging in games of chance<ref>''Domino'' vol. 3 #1–3 (April–May 2018). Marvel Comics.</ref>). The psionic aura benefits and protects Domino even when she isn't consciously aware that danger is present.<ref>''Domino - Hotshots'' #1 (March 2019)</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Schedeen |first=Jesse |date=2017-03-16 |title=Domino Explained: Who Is the Deadpool 2 Character? |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/16/domino-explained-who-is-the-deadpool-2-character |access-date=2022-08-26 |website=IGN |language=en}}</ref>

Domino must be engaging in an action with multiple possible outcomes for her power to manifest—it will not trigger if she is inactive. Engaging in any action that her power can influence causes Domino's cerebral cortex to emit bio electrical pulses that guide her movements, enhancing her reflexes and agility to near-superhuman levels.

Domino is highly trained as a weapons expert and marksman; a superb athlete and swimmer; martial artist and hand-to-hand combatant; and an accomplished linguist.

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
Chris Condry of ''[[Looper (website)|Looper]]'' referred to Domino as "potentially the greatest gunslinger in history," saying, "Maybe the number one reason Domino deserves more love is that she is one of the only characters in comics history who allows for a complete suspension of disbelief with her every action. Domino, to whom anything is possible, is a writer's — and therefore a reader's –- dream come true."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Condry |first=Chris |date=2022-01-15 |title=Marvel's Most Underrated Female Superheroes |url=https://www.looper.com/734985/marvels-most-underrated-female-superheroes/ |access-date=2022-08-26 |website=Looper.com |language=en-US}}</ref> Rosie Knight of ''[[Nerdist]]'' called Domino "Marvel’s luckiest lady," writing, "Comics offer us up a smorgasbord of cool characters, and sometimes it’s hard to keep up with all of them.

Someone who’s lucky all the time and knows it can get into some crazy stuff. Making her a mercenary just leans into the slapstick violence you can pull off with her. And when you pair her with a fourth wall breaker like Deadpool, narrative convenience becomes an end goal of its own."<ref>{{Cite web |last=jbindeck2015 |date=2018-05-18 |title=Deadpool 2: Who is Domino? |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/comics/deadpool-2-who-is-domino/ |access-date=2022-08-26 |website=Den of Geek |language=en-US}}</ref> Darby Harn of ''[[CBR.com]]'' wrote, "Domino is one of the luckiest people around, and that's not only to do with her probability-altering powers. This member of the New Mutants and very quickly X-Force thereafter got in on the ground floor of the huge boom in popularity of the world of the X-Men in the early 90s.

Joshua Davison of ''[[Bleeding Cool]]'' called ''Domino'' #1 a "thoughtful, endearing, and thoroughly entertaining book about a badass anti-heroine," writing, "''Domino'' #1 is a wonderful comic with a lot of heart and fun at its core.

Rollin Bishop of ''[[Comicbook.com]]'' gave ''Domino: Hotshots'' #1 a grade of 4 out of 5, asserting, "Whereas Domino's previous outing ended as a muddled mess, this new miniseries picks up the pieces and orients them towards a new, Celestial threat with a capital "C" that gets things back in order swiftly.

This team features the Natasha Romanoff version of Black Widow, White Fox, Outlaw, Diamondback, and Atlas Bear. These drastically different characters who tend to operate solo now working together lead to comedic antics that will make any reader grin. However, their combined skills and ability make for unique action as they are caught between two warring nations. As a bonus, most of these characters are not household names thus making it far from the typical superhero team."<ref>{{Cite web |last=MacReady |first=Melody |date=2021-08-24 |title=Birds Of Prey: Gail Simone's 10 Best Comics, Ranked |url=https://screenrant.com/gail-simone-best-comic-books/ |access-date=2022-08-30 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref>

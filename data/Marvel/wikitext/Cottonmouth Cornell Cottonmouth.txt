'''Cottonmouth''' ('''Cornell Stokes''') is a <!--Do not add "fictional" as it is tautological; supervillains (and characters in general) are by definition implied to be fictionalized to some extent.-->[[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

The character was portrayed by [[Mahershala Ali]] in the [[Luke Cage (season 1)|first season]] of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] television series ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]''.

==Publication history==
The character first appeared in ''[[Luke Cage, Power Man]]'' #18 (June 1974) in a story written by [[Len Wein]] and drawn by [[George Tuska]]. Cornell Cottonmouth, or just Cottonmouth, started out as a drug kingpin in [[New York City]]. He was involved in the events that led to [[Luke Cage]] gaining super powers and becoming "Power Man". Cottonmouth tried to recruit Cage to his organization, but was ultimately knocked out and turned over to police by Cage. During the "[[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]]" storyline, Cottonmouth returned as part of [[Nightshade (Marvel Comics)|Nightshade]]'s gang, Flashmob where they come into conflict with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] as well as a new [[Power Man (Victor Alvarez)|Power Man]], who, like his predecessor, knocked Cottonmouth out and turned him over to police.

==Fictional character biography==
Not much is known about Cornell Cottonmouth's history except that he has established himself as a drug lord in New York. When [[Diamondback (Willis Stryker)|Willis Stryker]] wanted to frame [[Luke Cage|Carl Lucas]], he stole a shipment of heroin from Cottonmouth's organization.<ref>''Luke Cage, Hero for Hire'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Upon changing his name to Luke Cage, Carl decided to track down the drugs that were used to frame him. Cage used a number of informants in his search. The informant Flea was successful in his search yet his investigations were discovered. Before dying from the poisons inflicted on him by Cottonmouth's men, Flea managed to inform Cage of his discovery.<ref>''Power Man'' #18</ref> Upon learning who sent Flea to infiltrate his organization, Cottonmouth got the idea of recruiting Cage to his organization. He sent his trademark snakes to Luke's office "to show him that he means business." Cottonmouth then sent his henchmen Mike and Ike to make an offer to Luke. Luke managed to take out the snakes and defeat Mike and Ike. Mike ended up snitching to Luke where Cottonmouth was located. Luke agreed to join Cottonmouth's organization (to learn where his records were kept). Cottonmouth then began to test Cage's loyalty by sending him to steal a shipment of heroin from the rival crimeboss, Morgan. After Cage's success, he earned Cottonmouth's trust and began working for him until Cottonmouth caught Cage attempting to steal his records. Cottonmouth attacked Luke and was assisted by his henchman Slick. Cage then knocked Cottonmouth into Slick who fell out a window to his death. When Cottonmouth stated that the supposed records were in Slick's mind, Luke slammed Cottonmouth into an oak desk where Cottonmouth fell unconscious. Cage then called the police to come pick up Cottonmouth.<ref>''Power Man'' #19-20. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the 2010 "[[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]]" storyline, Cottonmouth appeared as a member of [[Nightshade (Marvel Comics)|Nightshade]]'s gang called the Rivals. Cottonmouth established a section of turf where he sold drugs and hired out prostitutes only for him to be attacked by [[Hand (comics)|Hand]] ninjas that were sent by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]. However, [[Power Man (Victor Alvarez)|Power Man]] arrived dispersing the Hand ninjas and then Power Man broke Cottonmouth's teeth.<ref>''Shadowland: Power Man'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Cottonmouth later had his broken teeth replaced by gold-capped sharp teeth. When Power Man was apparently beaten and defeated by five corrupt police officers, Cottonmouth prepared to bite off a part of Power Man's face only to be leashed by Nightshade. At first, Cottonmouth was surprised when Nightshade offered Power Man to become her enforcer. Cottonmouth then became pleased when Nightshade had set up Power Man to fight [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]].<ref>''Shadowland: Power Man'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> To Nightshade's surprise, Power Man managed to side with Iron Fist and knocked out Cottonmouth while Nightshade escaped.<ref>''Shadowland: Power Man'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the 2011 "[[Spider-Island]]" storyline, Cottonmouth alongside Nightshade and Flashmob (consisting of [[Chemistro]], Cheshire Cat, Commanche, Dontrell "Cockroach" Hamilton, [[Mr. Fish]], and Spear) tried to leave a spider-infested Manhattan by crossing a bridge only to be stopped by [[Misty Knight]] and her [[Heroes for Hire]] (consisting of [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], [[Gargoyle (comics)|Gargoyle]], [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]], and [[Silver Sable]]).<ref>''Spider-Island: Heroes for Hire'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Cottonmouth next appears as one of the competitors in an underground fight club that is broken up by [[Deadpool]], [[Gambit (Marvel Comics)|Gambit]], and Fat Cobra.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Ben Acker and Ben Blacker|penciller = Danilo Beyruth|inker = Danilo Beyruth|colorist = Cris Peter|letterer = VC's Joe Sabino|editor = Jordan D.

Cottonmouth was at some point arrested and imprisoned in Ryker's Island, which he escapes from during a riot that occurs during "[[Civil War II]]". With all of his assets either seized by the FBI or appropriated by [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]], a desperate Cottonmouth reaches out to Piranha Jones for help, and is convinced by Jones to side with him and Black Cat in an upcoming war for control of Harlem.<ref name = "PM&IF10"/> Unimpressed by the duo's plans, Cottonmouth abandons them in favor of joining [[Alex Wilder]]'s [[Pride (comics)|New Pride]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = David F.

After learning of Cage's actions, NYPD Detective [[Rafael Scarfe]] kills the last thug and sells out Cage to Stokes, who makes several failed attempts to kill Cage or drive him out of Harlem. Meanwhile, after [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|internal affairs]] starts to investigate his actions, Scarfe attempts to blackmail Stokes, who shoots him and leaves him for dead. Before he dies, Scarfe tells Cage and [[Claire Temple]] everything he knows about Stokes' operation. Cottonmouth is subsequently arrested, but the Stokes' family lawyer [[Big Ben Donovan|Benjamin Donovan]] bails him out.<ref name="Manifest" /> While addressing the fallout, Stokes gets into an argument with Dillard over their upbringing.

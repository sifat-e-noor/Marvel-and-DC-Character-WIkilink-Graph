The character first appeared in the comic book ''The [[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #4 (March 1964) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]. The character has since starred in two self-titled [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] and has historically been depicted as a regular team member in superhero title ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]''.

Quicksilver has the superhuman ability to move at great speeds. In most depictions, he is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], a human born with innate superhuman powers. In comic book stories beginning in 2015, he is the product of genetic experimentation by the [[High Evolutionary]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://io9.com/marvel-confirms-scarlet-witch-and-quicksilver-are-no-lo-1703112599|title= Marvel Confirms Scarlet Witch And Quicksilver Are No Longer Mutants|last= Whitbrook|first= James|work= io9.com|archive-url= https://www.webcitation.org/64NTfJTNo?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/scwitch.htm|archive-date= January 1, 2012|url-status= dead|access-date= May 8, 2015}}</ref> Quicksilver most commonly appears in fiction associated with the [[X-Men]], having been introduced as an adversary for the superhero team. In later stories, he became a superhero himself. He is the twin brother of the [[Scarlet Witch]] and, in most depictions, the son of [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] and the half-brother of [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Polaris]].

Debuting in the [[Silver Age of comic books]], Quicksilver has featured in several decades of Marvel continuity, starring in the self-titled series ''Quicksilver'' and as a regular team member in [[superhero]] title the ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]''. 

The character has also appeared in a range of movie, television, and video game adaptations. Two separate live-action versions of Quicksilver have been adapted by two different film studios: [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson]] portrayed the character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) franchise, appearing in ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' (2014) as a cameo and ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015) while [[Evan Peters]] portrayed [[Peter Maximoff|him]] in the [[20th Century Fox]] films ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' (2014), ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'' (2016) and ''[[Dark Phoenix (film)|Dark Phoenix]]'' (2019), as well as a cameo in ''[[Deadpool 2]]'' (2018). Peters later appeared as an imposter Pietro in the MCU television series ''[[WandaVision]]'' (2021), as a nod to his past role.

Quicksilver first appears in ''[[X-Men]]'' #4 (March 1964) and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-writer [[Jack Kirby]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Jonathan Rikard |title=X-Factor vs. X-Factor: A Look at the Role of Identity in Peter David's X-Factor |journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=#65|pages=73–78 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]| date=July 2013|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> The character initially appears as an antagonist to the X-Men, although before long he becomes a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and appears as a regular character in that title beginning with ''The Avengers'' #16 in May 1965. He has made numerous other appearances in that title, and other related titles, sometimes as a member of the team, sometimes as an ally, and sometimes as an antagonist.

From 1991 to 1993 Quicksilver was a regular character in the first volume of ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]''. The series emphasized the character's irritability and arrogance, which writer [[Peter David]] felt were a natural consequence of his powers, explaining: 
{{bquote|Have you ever stood in the [[post office]] behind a woman with 20 packages who wants to know every single way she can send them to Africa? It drives you nuts! You think to yourself, "Why do I have to put up with this? These people are so slow, they're costing me time, and it's so damned irritating. I wish I didn't have to put up with this." Now—imagine that the ''entire world'' was like that... except for you. ... to Quicksilver, as he said in an issue of ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' many, many moons ago, the rest of the world is moving in slow motion. That must really, really get on your nerves. Quicksilver lives in a world filled with people who don't know how to use [[cash machine]]s, and want to know all the ways to send packages to Africa, and can never get your order right in a [[Burger King]] unless you repeat it several times. That would tend to make you feel very superior to everyone and very impatient with everyone.<ref>{{cite news | last = O'Neill | first = Patrick Daniel | date = February 1992 | title = Peter David | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = #105 | page = 20 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}</ref>}}

Quicksilver also starred in ''Quicksilver'', a regular ongoing eponymous series that began in November 1997 and ran for 13 issues.

The character also played a pivotal role in the ''[[House of M]]'' and ''[[Avengers: The Children's Crusade]]''.

Quicksilver appeared as a supporting character in ''[[Avengers Academy]]'' from issue #1 (August 2010) through its final issue #39 (January 2013). He appears as one of the members of ''All-New [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'', which was launched in 2014 as part of the second [[Marvel NOW!]] wave.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=48406 |title=NYCC EXCLUSIVE: David Resurrects the Team in "All-New X-Factor" |website=Comic Book Resources |date=2013-10-11 |access-date=2013-10-31}}</ref> Writer [[Peter David]]'s handling of the character in that book earned the character a 2014 @ssie award from [[Ain't It Cool News]]. 
AICN's Matt Adler commented that David writes the character best and that the "arrogant, impatient speedster" made the title worth following.<ref>[http://newsle.com/article/0/129185144/ "AICN COMICS 10th Annual @$$IE AWARDS Day Five: Best Crossover/Event!

==Powers and abilities==
Quicksilver was originally presented as a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] capable of moving and thinking at superhuman speeds. Originally capable of running at the [[speed of sound]],<ref>{{Marvelwiki|Quicksilver|Quicksilver}}</ref> exposure to the [[High Evolutionary]]'s Isotope E made it possible for the character to run at [[Supersonic|supersonic speeds]] of up to [[Mach number|Mach]] 10 and resist the effects of [[friction]], reduced [[oxygen]], and [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] impact while moving at super-speeds.<ref name="OHotMUV2#10"/><ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Also, he has a fast metabolism and can heal more rapidly than the average human.<ref name="OHotMUV2#10"/> His speed allows him to perform such feats as creating [[cyclone]]-strength winds and running up walls or across bodies of water.<ref name="OHotMUV2#10">''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' Vol 2 #10. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Avengers'' Vol 3 #40. Marvel Comics.</ref> Pietro's mind can perceive information with a [[Eidetic memory|photographic memory]] short term, becoming faster than the [[Action potential|speed of thought]], because he can shift his thoughts at a speed faster than normal thought.<ref name="OHotMUAtZ9">''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> Also, he can cause vibrations in his body to transfer to solid material and has superior agility and reflexes compared to other mutants.<ref name="OHotMUAtZ9"/><ref name="XF#1"/> It has been revealed that one of the reasons for his abrasive and impatient personality is that it seems to him that the rest of the world is moving in slow motion and that he is constantly waiting for it to catch up. As he once explained, "Have you ever stood in line at a banking machine behind a person who didn't know how to use it?... Now, imagine, Doctor, that everyone you work with, everywhere you go, your entire world is filled with people who can't work cash machines".<ref>''X-Factor'' #87: "The X-Amination". Marvel Comics.</ref>

Quicksilver lost his powers of speed when his sister removed most of his powers, but he gains new powers courtesy of the inhumans' [[Terrigen Mist]]. The mist gives Quicksilver the ability to displace himself out of mainstream time and space and "jump" into the future. He can summon several time-displaced duplicates of himself and appear to teleport by "jumping" into the future and then returning to the present at a new location.<ref>''Son of M'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Son of M'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref name="SoM#1t6XF#20"/> By voluntarily embedding fragments of the Terrigen Crystals into his own body, he could empower former mutants with extreme versions of their superhuman abilities.<ref name="XFV3#7">''X-Factor'' Vol 3 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, the effect was usually fatal.<ref name="XFV3#7"/><ref>''X-Factor'' Vol 3 #11. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref name="SoM#1t6XF#20"/> The crystals were subsequently forced from his body by the mutant [[Rictor]], leaving him without these abilities. After having a series of hallucinations, Quicksilver saw a woman in mortal danger and felt a desire to be a hero which made him regain his original powers in order to save the woman's life.<ref name="XF#1">''X-Factor: The Quick and the Dead'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later on, Quicksilver regained these enhanced powers of time "jumping" and temporal duplication for a while by physically imbedding the crystals into his flesh.<ref>''Silent War'' #3-4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

It was later revealed that Quicksilver actually was a normal child that was put through several experiments by the [[High Evolutionary]] which granted his powers in the first place.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Marvel licensed the filming rights of the [[X-Men]] and related concepts, such as [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]], to [[20th Century Fox]], who created a [[X-Men (film series)|film series]] based on the franchise. Years later, Marvel started their own film franchise, the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], which focused on characters that they had not licensed to other studios, such as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. Quicksilver and [[Scarlet Witch]] were part of a dispute between the two studios. Fox would claim the rights over them because they were both mutants and children of [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], the villain of most of their films, while Marvel would also claim those rights because the editorial history of the characters in comic books is more associated with the Avengers rather than the X-Men. The studios came to an agreement that allowed both to use the characters, with the condition that they could not make reference to the other studio's properties. The Fox films could not mention them as members of the Avengers while the Marvel films could not mention them as mutants or children of Magneto.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/why-quicksilver-is-in-x-men-and-avengers-2015-4|title=Why these two characters are allowed to appear in both the X-Men and Avengers movies|last=Acuna|first=Kirsten|date=April 30, 2015|work=Business Insider|access-date=April 27, 2016}}</ref> The arrangement became moot following the [[acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney]] - the parent company of [[Marvel Studios]], and the confirmation that future X-Men films will take place within the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<ref>{{cite web|first=Zack|last=Sharf|date=April 9, 2019 |title=Kevin Feige Says 'It Will Be a Very Long Time' Until the X-Men Join the Marvel Cinematic Universe|url= https://www.indiewire.com/2019/04/kevin-feige-long-time-x-men-marvel-cinematic-universe-1202057131/|work=[[IndieWire]]|access-date=September 10, 2020 }}</ref>

==Petra==
'''Petra''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in the [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Petra first appears in the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[X-Men: Deadly Genesis]]'' #1 (2006) and was created by writer [[Ed Brubaker]] and artist [[Pete Woods]]. She is one of the "Missing X-Men". The word "petra" means "rocky" in Latin, and "stone" in [[Greek language|Greek]].

Petra was the first of her family to be born in the [[United States]]. Her mother, father, and brother emigrated from [[Denmark]] while her mother was pregnant with Petra. They lived the typical American life in the suburbs of [[New York City]] for most of Petra's childhood. Shortly after her thirteenth birthday, Petra's family was killed by a rockslide while on a camping trip. Unknowingly, Petra used her mutant powers of earth manipulation to avoid getting hurt.

After spending weeks in Child Protective Services, Petra was sent to live in [[New Jersey]] in a foster home. She was placed in a home that had five other children that were forced to share the same bedroom. Her foster mother was old and uncaring, and her foster father was too caring, trying to [[Sexual abuse|hold and touch]] Petra all the time. One day on an outing to [[Central Park]], Petra's foster father tried to touch her but sank knee-deep into the ground. It was then that Petra realized that she was a [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], and she ran away. She found a cave and hid there for days crying, knowing that with her abilities she could have either killed or saved her family.

She camped in [[Central Park]] for a couple of years, using her power to manipulate rock caves into shelters to avoid being arrested and sent to juvenile detention centers. When she was sixteen, she discovered another useful aspect of her ability: she could turn [[coal]] into [[diamond]]s by concentrating hard enough. For a year, she used this aspect of her power to make diamonds of varying sizes to sell to [[pawn shop]]s so she could buy food and survive.

One day, however, a pawn shop employee said he was going to call the owner of the store, but he called the police. Running to her rock shelter, the police found Petra before she could hide, and took her into custody after a brief battle. When she awoke, a female guard informed her that she was being released into the custody of a woman, later revealed to be [[Moira MacTaggert|Dr. Moira MacTaggert]], who was there to help Petra. This at first frightened Petra because she had never known anyone to try to help her because of her abilities, only hurt her.<ref>''X-Men: Deadly Genesis'' #1</ref>

After some time with Dr. MacTaggert, [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] took Petra and the other children within custody ([[Sway (comics)|Sway]], [[Darwin (comics)|Darwin]], and [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]]) to rescue the original [[X-Men]] team trapped on the mutant island [[Krakoa]].{{issue|date=January 2013}} Petra instinctively used her powers to bury Vulcan and Darwin, and then gets incinerated by the volcano creature that was created by Krakoa.<ref>''X-Men: Deadly Genesis'' #6</ref>

When the X-Men establish Krakoa as a mutant paradise, Petra was among the revived mutants living there, She, Sway, and Vulcan was residing in the Summer House.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 5 #8</ref>

During the "[[Empyre]]" storyline, Petra and Sway have a drink with Vulcan at the Summer House on the Moon. After Vulcan defeated his [[Cotati (comics)|Cotati]] attackers, Petra and Sway catch up to him.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 5 #10</ref>

Petra was a "terrakinetic" or "geo-morph",<ref>''X-Men: Deadly Genesis'' #4</ref> having the ability to [[psychokinetic]]ally manipulate, control, levitate and reshape the classic element of [[earth]]—[[sand]], [[stone]], [[rock (geology)|rock]], [[lava]], and/or dirt—and could even transform the consistency of earth and rock, such as turning a lump of [[coal]] into a [[diamond]].<ref>''X-Men: Deadly Genesis'' #1</ref> She also could use this power to cause minor [[earthquakes]] and create shapes out of solid rock.

===Petra in other media===
A character with both Petra's striking resemblance and powers appears in the ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' animated series: '''Christy Nord''' (voiced by [[Kari Wahlgren]]). This iteration is the daughter of [[kinetic energy]] absorbing mutant [[David North (comics)|Christopher Nord]]. Like Petra, she has the mutant ability to manipulate the earth and stone. In the episode "Past Discretions", she was seen in flashbacks living with Christopher on a farm near the Canadian border at the age of 6, when her father became [[Team X (comics)|Team X]]'s target. [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] was sent to capture Nord, only to realize this could make Christy an orphan. Ten years later, Wolverine reappears to which Christy attacks him for apparently being responsible for her being an orphan. However, Christy realizes that Wolverine had saved her and [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] was responsible for her father's apparent demise. In the episode "Stolen Lives", Christy gets abducted by Maverick for [[Abraham Cornelius|Dr. Abraham Cornelius]] and [[Professor Thorton]], however, she is rescued by Wolverine and [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]. With [[Emma Frost]]'s help, Christy reunites with her father.

==Phage==
'''Phage''' is the name used by a [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] in [[Marvel Comics]]. The symbiote, created by [[David Michelinie]] and [[Ron Lim]], first appeared in ''[[Venom: Lethal Protector]]'' #4 (May 1993), and was named in ''Carnage, U.S.A.'' #2 (March 2012) after an unrelated character from the ''Venom: The Hunted'' comic storyline and ''Venom: Along Came A Spider'' toy line.<ref>Stuart Vandal. [https://archive.today/20130221074307/http://www.comixfan.net/forums/showthread.php?t=46668&page=5 ComixFan Forum – "Things people keep getting wrong", p. 5], ''http://www.comixfan.net/ X-World Comics Presents . . . Comixfan, the #1 Online Comics Resource!'' October 13, 2011. Accessed November 24, 2011.</ref> It was created as one of five symbiote "children" forcefully spawned from the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote along with [[Riot (Marvel Comics)|Riot]], [[Agony (comics)|Agony]], [[Lasher (comics)|Lasher]] and [[Scream (comics)|Scream]]. Unlike his "siblings", Phage primarily sports symbiote spikes.

Phage's first host was '''Carl Mach''', a mercenary hired by [[Carlton Drake]]'s [[Life Foundation]] in San Francisco. Mach bonds with Phage in conjunction with Scream (Donna Diego), Agony (Leslie Gesneria), Lasher (Ramon Hernandez) and Riot (Trevor Cole). After Phage and his four symbiote "siblings" are defeated by [[Spider-Man]] and Venom,<ref>''Venom: Lethal Protector'' #1-5</ref> they kidnap [[Eddie Brock]] in an attempt to communicate with alien symbiotes in Chicago. When Brock refuses to aid them, the hosts are killed by Diego, who had developed schizophrenia due to Scream's influence.<ref>''Venom: Separation Anxiety'' #1-4</ref>

Phage merges with Riot, Lasher and Agony to form the [[Hybrid (Scott Washington)|Hybrid]] symbiote,<ref>''Venom: Along Came a Spider'' #1</ref> but a military group separates them for the U.S. Government.

The Phage symbiote's second host was '''Rico Axelson''', a [[Lieutenant]] assigned to the Mercury Team. With [[Cletus Kasady]] on the loose in Colorado, Axelson trains with Phage for months for specific tasks alongside Riot (Howard Odgen), Lasher (Marcus Simms), and Agony (James Murphy).<ref>''Carnage, U.S.A.'' #2-5</ref> However, Axelson and his teammates are killed by Carnage in their secret base.<ref>''Deadpool vs. Carnage'' #3</ref> The four symbiotes bond to [[Deadpool]] to fight Carnage before bonding with Mercury Team's [[War Dog (Marvel Comics)|dog]].<ref>''Deadpool vs. Carnage'' #4</ref>

After being possessed by [[Knull (character)|Knull]], the four symbiotes possess a bickering family, with Phage taking the son '''Billy'''. The group head to New York to assist in Carnage's quest<ref>''Absolute Carnage: Separation Anxiety'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref> and hunt Dylan Brock and [[Normie Osborn]] but are defeated and separated from their hosts by the [[Maker (Reed Richards)|Maker]].<ref>''Venom'' Vol. 4 #17-18</ref> 

Phage, Riot, Lasher, and Agony merge into one symbiote once more to fight [[Mania (character)|Andi Benton]] and Scream, but are defeated and forced to escape.<ref>''King in Black: Planet of the Symbiotes'' #1</ref>

The Phage symbiote's fourth and fifth hosts are '''[[Bullet (Marvel Comics)|Buck Cashman]]''' initially and a hunting dog subsequently. Led by the [[Carnage (character)|Carnage]] symbiote, Phage and the other three symbiote enforcers participate in a conspiracy involving the [[Friends of Humanity]], only to be defeated by [[Flash Thompson]], Silence and [[Toxin (comics)|Toxin]] and taken into in [[Alchemax]]'s custody.<ref>''Extreme Carnage: Toxin'' #1</ref><ref>''Extreme Carnage: Agony'' #1</ref><ref>''Extreme Carnage: Omega'' #1</ref>

When Jessica finds out, she leaves Malcolm handcuffed in her bathroom and forces him to go into [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=AKA The Sandwich Saved Me|series=Marvel's Jessica Jones|credits=Surjik, Stephen (director); Dana Baratta (writer)|network=[[Netflix]]|airdate=November 20, 2015|season=1|number=5}}</ref> He soon becomes the leader of a support group for Kilgrave's victims,<ref>{{cite episode|title=AKA You're a Winner!|series=Marvel's Jessica Jones|credits=Surjik, Stephen (director); Edward Ricourt (writer)|airdate=November 20, 2015|season=1|number=6}}</ref> helps Robyn get closure after Kilgrave kills her brother,<ref>{{cite episode|title=AKA I've Got the Blues|series=Marvel's Jessica Jones|credits=Briesewitz, Uta (director); Scott Reynolds & Liz Friedman (writer)|network=[[Netflix]]|airdate=November 20, 2015|season=1|number=11}}</ref> stays by [[Luke Cage|Luke]]'s bedside while he's recovering from a concussion, and after Kilgrave is defeated, begins to work for Jessica as her secretary.<ref>{{cite episode|title=AKA Smile|series=Marvel's Jessica Jones|credits=Rymer, Michael (director); Scott Reynolds & Melissa Rosenberg (story); Jamie King & Scott Reynolds (writer)|network=[[Netflix]]|airdate=November 20, 2015|season=1|number=13}}</ref>

'''Presence''' is the name of a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

As a younger man, Sergei was a Belarusian nuclear physicist born in [[Minsk]], [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|BSSR]]. His twin children, [[Vanguard (Marvel Comics)|Nikolai Krylenko]] and [[Darkstar (Marvel Comics)|Laynia Petrovna]], were taken from birth by the Soviet government to be trained as soldiers, after their mutant natures manifested.

Sergei eventually became one of the most influential men behind the scenes of the Soviet government.  However, despite being a scientific genius, he was also quite mad. He caused a [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]]-like nuclear disaster in the "Forbidden Zone" using cobalt radiation baths and a nuclear blast, which transformed Tania Belinsky into his super-powered thrall as the second [[Starlight (Marvel Comics)|Red Guardian]]. The nuclear energy transformed Sergei into a superhuman being as well, and he could now generate nuclear energy within his own body for various uses. Sergi began calling himself "The Presence". The Presence and Red Guardian battled the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] when they came to find her. The Presence left when she regained her free will and spurned him.<ref>''The Defenders'' #52-55</ref> Soon after, the Presence battled a giant mutated amoeba in the "Forbidden Zone", and was then reunited and reconciled with Red Guardian.<ref>''The Defenders'' #61-63, 65</ref>

The government now wanted the threat of the Presence eliminated. His own children had been trained by the government as super-powered soldiers and, unaware of their true relationship, were sent to kill him. Alongside the Red Guardian, Presence encountered the [[Hulk]], [[Professor Phobos]], and the [[Soviet Super-Soldiers]] in the "Forbidden Zone". Darkstar and Vanguard learned that the Presence was their father and turned against the Soviet regime, and saved the Presence from Phobos. In order to save the Soviet Union from the dangerous, spreading radiation of the so-called Forbidden Zone, an irradiated Soviet wasteland, the Presence and the Red Guardian absorbed all the radiation into themselves and left for outer space, where they claimed they would transform themselves into inert matter.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #258-259</ref> The twins became agents on their own, fighting for the good of the people, and sometimes working with their father.

The Presence was revealed to be held prisoner with Red Guardian (now calling herself '''[[Starlight (Marvel Comics)|Starlight]]''') on the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]]'s laboratory world.<ref>''Quasar'' #16</ref> The pair returned to Earth with the [[Jack of Hearts (Marvel Comics)|Jack of Hearts]]. The Presence attempted to kill Eon, but was instead trapped in the "Quantum Zone" dimension by [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]].<ref>''Quasar'' #19-20</ref> It was revealed in flashback how [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]] had persuaded the Presence to attack Eon.<ref>''Quasar'' #23</ref> The Presence was eventually rescued from the "Quantum Zone" by [[Neutron (comics)|Neutron]], and teamed with him to seek vengeance on Quasar. The Presence learned of the Soviet Union's collapse, and returned to Russia with the intent to create a "new order".<ref>''Quasar'' #45-46</ref> Later, the Presence sent Starlight to capture the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] and Darkstar.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #70</ref>

Vanguard was ultimately killed in a battle while he and Darkstar were aiding the cosmic hero [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]. Darkstar blamed Quasar for her brother's death and fled back to Russia. When she encountered her father, Darkstar shared her feelings with him, and the Presence forced Quasar to flee [[Earth]] on the threat of killing Quasar's loved ones. Sergei visited his son's memorial and sought to revive him by shifting his atoms to microscopically enter Vanguard's body.  There he discovered a trace of Vanguard's mutant energy remained, keeping him faintly alive. The Presence managed to use this energy to resurrect his son, but nearly exhausted his own power, and was cast adrift in the subatomic reality he had entered.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}

While in subatomic exile, the Presence discovered new aspects of his power and atomic particles, and, when he had sufficiently regenerated, resumed his normal size and returned to the Forbidden Zone. There, he embarked on a plan to unite all of the former Soviet Union by transforming its people into a race of zombie-like radioactive beings living under a communal mind.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol.3 #42</ref> He managed to convert several Siberian scientists, Vanguard and the rest of the [[Winter Guard]], and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], who investigated the disturbance, leaving only [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and the seemingly-immortal [[Firebird (Marvel Comics)|Firebird]] to stand against him.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol.3 #43</ref> As Thor threatened to kill the Presence, Starlight, as the Presence's companion, ultimately offered their surrender and used her own power to revive those who had been transformed and remand herself and the Presence to Russian custody; she did not share his vision, but their powers meant that they would only ever have each other for company, and so she wished to keep him alive.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol.3) #44</ref> In the final struggle of the [[Kang Dynasty|Kang War]], the Presence and Starlight aided in the struggle to destroy [[Kang the Conqueror]]'s Damocles Base space station,<ref>''The Avengers'' vol.3 #52</ref> with Starlight blackmailing the Presence for assistance by threatening to leave him if he attempted anything more than simply doing his job and subsequently returning to his cell.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol.3 #53</ref>

In the 2010 ''Darkstar and Winter Guard'' limited series, The Presence was apparently destroyed permanently when the Russian superhero Powersurge sacrificed his life to defeat him after he once again tried to conquer Russia after Starlight left him for good to join the People's Protectorate, where she fell in love with his son, [[Vanguard (Marvel Comics)|Vanguard]].{{Issue|date=July 2011}}<ref>{{cite web |first=Jim |last=Gourley |url=http://swordandscript.com/general/the-sword-and-script-interview-david-gallaher |title=The Sword and Script Interview: David Gallaher |publisher=Sword and Script |date=April 20, 2010 |access-date=May 19, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521012134/http://swordandscript.com/general/the-sword-and-script-interview-david-gallaher |archive-date=May 21, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Kevin |last=Mahadeo |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=26323 |title=Gallaher Thaws Out the Winter Guard |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=May 21, 2010 |access-date=May 21, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Vaneta |last=Rogers |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/Darkstar-Ellis-Gallaher-100525.html |title=From High Moon to DARKSTAR: Zuda Alums Talk Russian Heroes |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=May 25, 2010 |access-date=June 10, 2010 }}</ref>

In ''Deadpool and the Mercs for Money'', the Presence is briefly revived by Umbral Dynamics (a corporation secretly led by Caroline Le Fay) by harvesting the power of several superhumans with radiation-related powers. After a fight with the new Mercs for Money and Deadpool, the Presence is killed again by [[Negasonic Teenage Warhead]] who drains out all his power.<ref>''Deadpool and the Mercs for Money'' vol. 2 #4-5</ref>

===Presence in other media===
Presence appears in ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Characters|url=http://www.ign.com/wikis/lego-marvel-super-heroes-2/Characters|website=IGN Database|access-date=13 January 2018}}</ref> Captain America, She-Hulk, and Thor encounter him at a Siberian facility where radiation was high. When Captain America gets infected, Presence controls him and the infected workers until She-Hulk and Thor contain the radiation and free the infected. Before being beaten up by She-Hulk even when the [[Winter Guard]] arrived, Presence states that they do not know what is coming.

'''Protégé''' is a cosmic entity from an [[alternate future]] of the [[Marvel Universe]].

The character, created by [[Jim Valentino]], first appeared in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' #15 (Aug. 1991) as the childlike ruler of the [[Universal Church of Truth]] of the alternate future of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]. Valentino modeled him after his son Aaron at seven years old.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Buttery|first=Jarrod |title=Explore the Marvel Universe of the 31st Century with... the Guardians of the Galaxy|journal=[[Back Issue!]] |issue=#65|page=30|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=July 2013|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> He is depicted as a superhuman of unlimited potential, with the ability to duplicate not only super-powers, but also the skills of others simply by observing the ability being used; thus, he could acquire the [[psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] powers of the Guardian [[Vance Astro]] as easily as he could the marksmanship ability of Astro's teammate [[Nikki (comics)|Nikki]], by watching them in combat.

Within the context of the Marvel Comics universe, Protégé is the deity and leader of Universal Church of Truth to which [[List of Marvel Comics characters: R#Replica|Replica]], a member of the Guardians of the Galaxy, belongs.

'''Pulsar''', originally code-named '''Impulse''', is a member of the [[Shi'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (Marvel Comics)|Imperial Guard]]. Created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Dave Cockrum]], the character first appeared in ''X-Men'' #107 (Oct. 1977). An energy being in a containment suit, Pulsar is capable of flight and the projection of energy blasts. (Like many original members of the Imperial Guard, Pulsar is the analog of a character from [[DC Comics]]' [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]: in his case [[Wildfire (Drake Burroughs)|Wildfire]].)<ref name=CBR>Cronin, Brian. [https://www.cbr.com/x-men-dark-phoenix-saga-shiar-imperial-guard/ "Comic Legends: Why New Imperial Guard Members in Dark Phoenix Saga?"], ''CBR'' (APR 09, 2018).</ref>

Impulse was amongst the first of the Imperial Guard encountered by the team of superhuman mutants known as the [[X-Men]] who sought to rescue the [[Lilandra Neramani|Princess Lilandra]] from her insane brother emperor [[D'Ken]]. Following the orders of their emperor, the Guard clashed with the X-Men on a nameless Shi'ar Empire planet and were on the verge of winning when the band of interstellar freebooters known as the [[Starjammers]] arrived to turn the tide of battle in the X-Men's favor.<ref>''X-Men'' #107 (Oct. 1977).</ref> After the battle, Lilandra takes over as Majestrix, and the Guard swears allegiance to her.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #122 (June 1979).</ref>

He is with the Guard when they come into conflict with a rogue Space Knight named Pulsar and an alien named Tyreseus. After a large battle which also involves [[Rom the Space Knight|Rom]] and other Space Knights — which leads to the deaths of four new Guardsman — Pulsar and Tyreseus are defeated.<ref name=RomAnnual4>''Rom'' Annual #4 (Dec. 1985).</ref>

Impulse is again part of the mission during [[Operation: Galactic Storm]], an intergalactic war between the Shi'ar and the [[Kree]]. The Imperial Guard are integral to the Sh'iar creating a massive super weapon — the "Nega-Bomb" — using Kree artifacts, including the original [[Mar-Vell|Captain Marvel]]'s [[Nega-Bands]], which the Guard steals from the dead hero's tomb. This bomb is capable of devastating an area equivalent to that of the Kree Empire (which is supposedly located throughout the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]]). Ultimately, the Nega Bomb device is successfully detonated, devastating the Kree Empire, with billions dying instantaneously (98% of the Kree population).<ref>''[[Wonder Man]]'' #9 (May 1992).</ref> The Shi'ar annex the remnants of the Kree Empire, with Deathbird becoming [[viceroy]] of the Kree territories.<ref>''The Avengers'' #347 (May 1992).</ref>

[[Ronan the Accuser]] subsequently leads the Kree in a surprise attack against the Shi'ar, using the [[Inhumans]] as an army to disrupt the Shi'ar control of the Kree. Appearing over the city of [[Attilan]], Ronan seizes control in a surprise attack and forces the Inhumans and their king, [[Black Bolt]], to obey, or he would destroy their only home and everyone in it. He compels [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]], [[Gorgon (Inhuman)|Gorgon]], and [[Triton (comics)|Triton]] to covertly join the Imperial Guard, while Black Bolt and [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] attempt the assassination of the Shi'ar ruler Lilandra at a ceremony ratifying an alliance between the Shi'ar and the [[List of alien races in Marvel Comics#S|Spartoi]]. Black Bolt manages to defeat Ronan in personal combat.<ref>''The Inhumans'' vol. 3 #1–4 (June–October 2000).</ref> the attempt on Lilandra's life fails because the shapeshifting Imperial Guardsman Hobgoblin dies in her place.<ref>''The [[Inhumans]]'' vol. 3 #4 (Oct. 2000).</ref>

The character is seemingly killed by [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]] in the [[Emperor Vulcan]] storyline. Vulcan, a powerful mutant intent on conquering the Shi'ar Empire, fights the Guard, killing Cosmo and [[Smasher (Marvel Comics)|Smasher]] (and seemingly Impulse, [[Neutron (Marvel Comics)|Neutron]], and [[Titan (Imperial Guard)|Titan]]) before he is defeated by [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]], who puts out his left eye.<ref name=XMen480>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #480 (Jan. 2007).</ref> It turns out that Impulse either survived Vulcan's attack or was replaced by someone from the Subguardian ranks, because he reappears in the ''[[War of Kings]]'' storyline.<ref>''War of Kings'' #1 (May 2009).</ref> Beginning with the [[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]] crossover, the character's name was changed to '''Pulsar'''.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 5 #1 (Dec. 2012).</ref>

Pulsar has many further adventures with the Imperial Guard, including being involved in the trial of [[Jean Grey]]<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #13 (May 2014).</ref> and the return of Thanos.<ref>''Thanos'' vol. 2 #3 (Mar. 2017).</ref>

'''Anti-Venom''' is a fictional [[antihero]] appearing in [[Comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. It first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #569 (August 2008), and was created by [[Dan Slott]] and [[John Romita Jr.]]<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=24}}</ref> The creature belongs to a race of amorphous [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] [[Parasitism|parasites]] known as the [[Symbiote (comics)|Symbiotes]] and is regarded as [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]'s symbiotic brother. His physical features include white "skin", a black face, and spider symbol across his chest.

==Hosts==

===Eddie Brock===
{{main|Eddie Brock}}
The 2008 story ''"[[New Ways to Die]]"'' features the first appearance of Anti-Venom.<ref name="Amazing568">{{Cite comic |writer=[[Dan Slott|Slott, Dan]] |penciller=[[John Romita Jr.|Romita Jr., John]] |inker=[[Klaus Janson|Janson, Klaus]] |colorist=White, Dean |letterer=Petit, Cory |editor=Brennan, Tom, Wacker, Stephen, [[Tom Brevoort|Brevoort, Tom]] |story=New Ways to Die, Part One: Back with Vengeance |title=[[The Amazing Spider-Man]] |volume=1 |issue= #568 |date=October 2008 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |location=New York, NY |page=}}</ref> '''[[Eddie Brock]]''' gets a job at a soup kitchen under [[Mister Negative|Martin Li]]. Brock is unknowingly cured of his cancer by [[Mister Negative|Martin Li]], who possesses the Lightforce abilities, and Brock believes it to be a miracle.<ref name="Amazing568"/> After Brock is attacked by [[Mac Gargan]] (the Venom symbiote's current host), the Venom symbiote attempts to reunite with Brock, at which point Brock's skin becomes [[Corrosive substance|caustic]] to the Venom symbiote. Brock is enveloped in a new white “Anti-Venom” symbiote when remnants of the Venom symbiote in his body merge with special [[antibodies]] (produced by his [[white blood cells]]) due to Li's Lightforce energy.<ref name="Amazing568"/><ref>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Dan Slott|Slott, Dan]] |penciller=[[John Romita Jr.|Romita Jr., John]] |inker=[[Klaus Janson|Janson, Klaus]] |colorist=White, Dean |letterer=Petit, Cory |editor=Brennan, Tom, Wacker, Stephen, [[Tom Brevoort|Brevoort, Tom]] |story=New Ways To Die, Part Two: The Osborn Supremacy |title=[[The Amazing Spider-Man]] |volume=1 |issue= #569 |date=October 1999 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |location=New York, NY |page=}}</ref> Eddie later sacrificed his Anti-Venom symbiote to cure people from the [[Queen (Marvel Comics)|Spider-Queen]]'s spider-virus during the ''[[Spider-Island]]'' event.

===Second host===
During the "[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]" storyline, a new version of Anti-Venom is seen in the crowd of new heroes attending a "self help" style seminar being held by [[Roderick Kingsley]] (aka the original [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]]). All the new heroes have been given heroic personas by Kingsley that already exist, but are no longer used. It is not shown whether the new Anti-Venom is indeed a symbiote or just a man in a suit designed to look like the original Anti-Venom symbiote. However, the speech bubble used for the character is stylized in a way to suggest a distortion of the character's voice similar to the way Eddie Brock spoke when bonded with the Anti-Venom symbiote.<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Kevin Shinick|Shinick, Kevin]] |penciller=[[Javier Rodríguez (artist)|Rodríguez, Javier]] |inker=Lopez, Alvaro |colorist=Rodríguez, Javier |letterer=Cowles, Clayton |editor=Pyle, Ellie |story=Got A Problem? Call Hobgoblin! |title=AXIS: Hobgoblin |volume=1 |issue= #1 |date=December 2014 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |location=New York, NY |page=}}</ref>

===Eugene "Flash" Thompson===
{{main|Flash Thompson}}
In the comic "Venom Inc.", Venom got captured by The Life Foundation and was experimented on. The Life Foundation accidentally poured malic acid on Venom which caused a chemical reaction in his body turning him into Anti-Venom. Anti-Venom got new abilities including the ability to faze through any solid object. He used it to escape the Life Foundation and bond with one of the scientists who happens to be Flash Thompson. Flash decides to use the symbiote for good and becomes "Agent Venom".

==Powers and abilities==
Anyone possessed by the Anti-Venom symbiote possesses superhuman strength, durability, and stamina, an accelerated and fast healing factor, genetic memory, detection of its Symbiote offspring, wall-crawling, web-generating abilities, spider-senses, immunity to [[Spider-Man]]'s spider-senses, and camouflage.

Unlike the other Symbiotes, the original Anti-Venom symbiote used by Eddie Brock is immune to fire, heat, and sound-based attacks. In addition, the Anti-Venom symbiote can produce antibodies that can "cure" a person afflicted by things like radioactivity, parasites, diseases, and drugs. The new Anti-Venom symbiote used by Flash Thompson has the ability to heal physical injuries as well.<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Dan Slott|Slott, Dan]], [[Mike Costa|Costa, Mike]] |penciller=[[Ryan Stegman|Stegman, Ryan]], Sandoval, Gerardo |inker=Leisten, Jay |colorist=Reber, Brian |letterer=Caramagna, Joe |editor=[[Nick Lowe (comics)|Lowe, Nick]], Lewis, Devin, Stock, Allison, Groneman, Thomas |story=Venom Inc. Part Six |title=Amazing Spider-Man: Venom Inc. Omega |volume=1 |issue= #1 |date=March 2018 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |location=New York, NY |page=}}</ref> Due to its failed attempt at curing Spider-Man's radiation-based powers, the Anti-Venom symbiote causes Spider-Man's powers to cancel out when they are too close of each other.

However, Anti-Venom does possess a few weaknesses of its own. It is vulnerable to high concentrations of [[Norman Osborn]]'s super-venom via [[Freak (Marvel Comics)#Freak (Spider-Man villain)|Freak]]'s DNA. Additionally since Martin Li's Lightforce touch created the symbiote, [[Mister Negative]]'s [[Darkforce]] touch can interfere or halt Anti-Venom's healing abilities. Also as seen during the Spider-Island event, overusing his healing powers can cause Anti-Venom's powers to weaken.

==Other versions==
In ''[[What If? (comics)|What If?]] Peter Parker became Kraven the Hunter'' where Peter Parker killed [[Kraven the Hunter]] and replaced Kraven as the new hunter, [[Madame Web]] hired Anti-Venom, [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] and Mac Gargan to stop Peter. Despite being successful in mortally injuring him, they were all defeated.<ref>''What If? Spider-Man'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the three-part episode "The Symbiote Saga", Anti-Venom awakens when the [[Carnage (character)|Carnage]] symbiote attacks New York and neutralizes the latter's various hosts. However, it is almost consumed by Carnage's "heart" until Spider-Man's identity is revealed to Harry. Anti-Venom re-bonds with Harry and sacrifices itself to cure New York of Carnage's infestation, but its abilities are later claimed by the [[Mary Jane Watson|Carnage Queen]].
* The Anti-Venom symbiote appears in the ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' episode "Vengeance of Venom".<ref>{{cite episode|title=Vengeance of Venom|series=[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man: Maximum Venom]]|network=[[Disney XD]]|season=3|number=3|airdate=June 21, 2020}}</ref> This version is created when '''[[Groot]]''' is hit with a sonic device used by [[Aunt May|May Parker]] based on [[Max Modell]]'s suggestion to access the alien's pollination abilities and hybridize it with symbiote power to cure the Klyntar invasion force's hosts.

Freed from Sloan's control, Anti-Venom attacks him, only to accidentally push himself, Sloan, and [[Doctor Octopus]] into Sloan's time portal, fusing them into the monstrous '''Atrocity'''.

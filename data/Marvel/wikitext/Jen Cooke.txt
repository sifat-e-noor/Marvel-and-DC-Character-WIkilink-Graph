When it seemed that his time had come, a [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Marine Force Recon]] group led by Captain Castle attacked the village and rescued Howe. In 1972, Howe was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]]. Admiring the Force Recon Marines (Howe assumed his rescuers were [[United States Navy SEALs|SEALs]] or [[Long-range reconnaissance patrol|LURPs]]; many years later, [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Howe met Frank Castle in person and recognized him as the man that rescued him) for their proficiency, Howe joined the [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Berets]] for the remainder of the war and was among the first to join [[Delta Force]]. Howe is tasked by a cabal of military generals to arrest Castle, but then learns of the actual truth behind Castle's covert operation in Russia. Howe gives Castle the means of killing the generals by giving him a loaded [[M1911]] handgun, and destroys the incriminating evidence out of the belief that if exposed, the U.S. military would lose all sense of credibility.

Howe's assistant, Lieutenant Geller, reads Castle's military record and realizes that not only was Castle a Force Recon Marine, he also led the team that saved Howe's life in Vietnam; thus, Howe would spare Castle's life as repayment out of gratitude. Geller attempts to warn the generals, but it is too late.

===Molly von Richthofen===
'''[[NYPD]] Lieutenant Molly Elizabeth Chrysanthema Olga von Richthofen'''<ref>''The Punisher: War Zone'' vol. 2 #4 (Feb. 2009)</ref> first appeared in ''[[The Punisher (2000 series)|The Punisher]]'' vol. 4 #4. She is a talented investigator who, as punishment for refusing to sleep with the NYPD Commissioner, was assigned to take down the Gnucci crime family, which was as much a farce as Detective [[Martin Soap]]'s Punisher Task Force. It was her idea to team up with Soap, knowing that either [[Ma Gnucci]] or the Punisher would kill the other, and then they could move in and arrest whoever was left. During their investigation, Soap fell in love with Molly, who rebuffed Soap, since Molly is a lesbian. When Soap later became Commissioner, Molly left on a vacation in the tropics with a stripper and was preparing for her mayoral campaign.

A few years later, von Richthofen returned to New York and rejoined the NYPD. However, she was still disfavored by her male superiors and was assigned to the Punisher Task Force, since Molly previously served in that job. Ironically, Molly was later forced to fight alongside Castle against Elite's henchmen; during the ensuing battle, Molly's clothes caught fire and she was forced to strip to her bra and panties. Unfortunately for Molly, the gunfight was recorded by the local news media and she was publicly exposed as a Punisher sympathizer. Molly was subsequently suspended, pending a formal investigation.<ref>''The Punisher: War Zone'' vol. 2, #1-6 (Feb. 2009)</ref>

Staci Strobl and Nickie D. Phillips examined the character in their book ''Comic Book Crime: Truth, Justice, and the American Way'', noting her "lesbian as [[Psychopathy|psychopath]]" motif ''[[The Punisher War Zone|The Punisher: War Zone]]'' vol. 2, and writing, "Molly's violence may be interpreted as rage against the [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] constraints under which she operates both at work and at home, and is always infused, at least implicitly, with her sexuality. While Molly is certainly a competent law enforcement officer, her honor and integrity are belied by her abuse of power. Violence is used as one means of negotiating her sexual orientation, which is never far removed from her objectification as a female. In her confrontation with the [[American Mafia|Mafia]], she partners with Punisher and in the process undergoes numerous humiliations culminating in a "bra and panties" showdown captured by the media. There is space for the lesbian crime fighter, but only firmly in its place within masculine [[hegemony]]. As ''[[The New York Globe]]'' headlines reported the showdown, "''Lethal Weapons! Sexy Lesbian Lieutenant in Punisher Team-Up Carnage!''"<ref>{{cite book|author = Staci Strobl and Nickie D. Phillips|title = Comic Book Crime: Truth, Justice, and the American Way|url = http://nyupress.org/books/9780814767870/|access-date = 21 May 2015|year = 2013|publisher = [[New York University Press]]|isbn = 9780814767870|pages = 158–159}}</ref>

===Spacker Dave===
First appeared in ''[[The Punisher (2000 series)|The Punisher vol. 4 #1]]''.

A heavily pierced young tenant in the apartment building where Castle lived for a time under the alias of John Smith. He did little but hang about on the building's doorstep, but recognized "Smith" as the Punisher, something which he inadvertently divulged to mobsters who came looking for him. Despite being tortured by having his piercings pulled out and carving his name into his forehead, he did not betray Castle. He received a portion of [[Ma Gnucci]]'s money after leaving the hospital, and later inspired an underground movement called the "Spackers" who had bandaged faces similar to his. He reappeared years later, now no longer wearing any piercings or bandages, and had taken up the hobby of superhero spotting, much to Castle's chagrin. Dave was ecstatic when he met [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Spider-Man]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] in the flesh. He was trampled by the [[Hulk]], rendering him quadriplegic, which does not hamper his fascination with superheroes.

His tour of Vietnam was coming to an end, and he clung to Castle in a desperate attempt to stay alive, believing that Castle's prowess as a combatant would guarantee his safety. The events of ''The Punisher: Born'' are told largely from his perspective and narrated by him. On the night he was thirty-seven days from being discharged, the garrison was attacked by combined forces of NVA and Viet Cong. Of the Marines, Castle and Goodwin held out the longest, and Goodwin got to see air support arrive, only to be bayoneted seconds later. In his dying moments, he hallucinates of the bayonet missing him, being whisked away onto a passenger jet where he is tended to by attractive stewardesses as he previously wished.

===Elite===
The original Elite first appeared in ''[[The Punisher (2000 series)|The Punisher vol. 4 #5]]''. His son '''Tim''', the second Elite, first appeared in ''The Punisher: War Zone vol. 2 #1 (2009)''.

The first Elite was a fascist and racist vigilante who killed gang members, drug dealers and other criminals who "lower the tone" in his upper-class [[neighborhood]]. He even shot a lady's dog that urinated on the sidewalk and ran off a hot dog vendor who had set up shop in Elite's neighborhood by tossing a live grenade in the vendor's cart. Nevertheless, Elite was well-spoken: he was actually polite to his victims. Elite was the manager of an art gallery and had a wife, a son named Tim and a daughter. Elite later joined up with Mr. Payback and the Holy to form the Vigilante Squad, planning to exterminate all of New York City's criminals.

When the Punisher confronted the Vigilante Squad, he called Elite "a Nazi". Elite was gunned down by the Punisher seconds later: he was shot at least eight times at point-blank range by the Punisher's Uzi.

Elite's widow later remarried & his daughter suffered a mental breakdown and was sent to an insane asylum, but Tim inherited his father's wealth & possessions and eventually went to [[Princeton University|Princeton]]. Like his father, Tim was an arrogant, racist snob who hated minorities & the less fortunate; while high on [[cocaine]], Tim used his [[Porsche]] to run over a homeless man who got in his way, but the homeless man survived and Tim was arrested, convicted of attempted murder, sent to prison and expelled from Princeton.

Six years after his father's death, Tim took up his father's alter ego and vowed to avenge his father's murder at the hands of the Punisher. Elite set up an elaborate scheme that at first, made Castle believe his old nemesis, [[Ma Gnucci]], was still alive: Elite used several cosmetically-altered body-doubles of Ma to convince several mob families to assist him in eliminating the Punisher, but in the end Castle discovered Elite's scheme. Aided by NYPD Lieutenant Molly von Richtofen, Castle & Molly killed all of Elite's mob allies. Castle then killed Elite's henchmen & confronted Elite himself, telling him "What makes you think they haunt me?" Elite, too shocked to resist, could only say "Whuh...what?" Castle replied "Go", then executed Elite.

===Finn Cooley===
'''Finn Cooley''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Comics Universe]]. He first appeared in ''[[The Punisher (MAX)|The Punisher vol. 6 #7]]''.

A hideously disfigured Irish terrorist, an Irish mob boss and a demolitions expert, Cooley was formerly an [[Active Service Unit]] leader with the [[Provisional IRA]] in [[Derry]], [[Northern Ireland]], from 1986 to 1993, when he was arrested, interrogated by the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) at [[Castlereagh (borough)|Castlereagh]], convicted of murder & terrorism and sent to prison, but was released as part of the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in 1998. After Cooley was freed, he tried to join the [[Continuity IRA]], but that unit disavowed him, so Finn came to America. Cooley had to wear a facial mask as half of his face was blown off in an explosives accident, when the bomb he planted at a [[Belfast]] RUC police station prematurely detonated. He was also an expert in hand-to-hand combat.<ref>''The Punisher'' vol. 6 #8</ref> In 2003, Cooley planted fifty pounds of [[Semtex]] at an Irish bar in [[Hell's Kitchen]] in order to kill several rival Irish mob bosses, but the bomb went off prematurely, killing 11 and injuring 30 innocent people, one of whom was Frank Castle; Castle's friend [[MI6]] agent Yorkie Mitchell informed Castle who was responsible and provided MI6's intel files on Cooley and his associates; MI6 also ordered Mitchell to assassinate Cooley. Cooley was ironically killed by a bomb left behind by recently deceased Irish mob boss [[Nesbitt (comics)|Pops Nesbitt]], who thought Cooley and his rivals were unworthy of inheriting his fortune.<ref>''The Punisher'' vol. 6 #12</ref> Cooley had a nephew, Peter Cooley, who was a [[Provisional IRA]] soldier from 1994 to 1998, who served as his uncle's right-hand man, and was a prime suspect in the murders of three [[Operation Banner|British security forces]] soldiers, but was never arrested or convicted; one of the victims was [[Sergeant major#United Kingdom|Sergeant Major]] Stephen Lorimer, a close friend of Mitchell. Peter was captured by Castle & Mitchell, interrogated for information about Finn and the New York Irish mob leaders, then executed by [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] trooper [[Lance corporal#British Army and Royal Marines|Lance Corporal]] Andy Lorimer, in revenge for his father's murder.<ref>''The Punisher'' vol. 6 #9-12</ref>

Finn puts out a bounty, with his men shaking down business owners until they locate the Punisher's hideout and the vigilante's dog. Finn and his men capture the Punisher at the carousel where the Castle family was killed and haul the Punisher to a catacomb. Finn proceeds tortures Punisher by drilling through the vigilante's left foot but refuses to cooperate with him. He finally gets an answer when he threatens to give the same treatment to the vigilante's dog which had been rescued from the Irish. The stolen money turns out to be placed on top of a bomb and the money is destroyed. Punisher then breaks free, grabs a shotgun and asks Finn for answers about the Castle family's death. Finn refuses to talk, saying "Your family? Who cares!", prompting the Punisher to shoot fatally him point-blank, blowing off the left side of his face. The Punisher is pinned down by gunfire from several of Finn's remaining henchmen until [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], tipped off by Sgt. [[Brett Mahoney]] about Finn's activities, shows up to rescue.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Penny and Dime |episode-link=Penny and Dime |series=Daredevil |series-link=Daredevil (TV series) |network=[[Netflix]] |season=2 |number=4 |credits=Hoar, Peter (director); John C.

===General Kreigkopf===
First appeared in ''[[The Punisher (2001 series)|The Punisher vol. 5 #2]]''.

A former [[United States Marine Corps]] [[General]] who was infamous for committing [[war crimes|war atrocities]], later becoming a terrorist leader. During the [[Vietnam War]], [[Lieutenant]] Kreigkopf allowed his Marines to pillage the town of Ap Duc and rape its women, as a reward for defending the town. In the 1980s, during the [[Contra War]], [[Major]] Kreigkopf was directly responsible for the deaths of 426 [[Sandinistas]], two-thirds of which were killed with [[nerve agents]]. During [[Operation Desert Storm]], [[Colonel]] Kreigkopf ordered his Marines to use half of a [[Company (military unit)|company]] of Iraqi prisoners for [[bayonet]] practice. However, none of the war crimes were ever proven, a testament to Kreigkopf's influence with military leaders.

As a General, Kreigkopf did the unthinkable: he struck a [[Lance Corporal]] in the neck with a rifle butt, rendering the young Marine permanently paralyzed from the neck down, for [[insubordination]]. Worse, the entire incident was filmed by a [[CNN]] camera team. Before Kreigkopf could face a [[Courts-martial in the United States|court-martial]], he was smuggled out of the United States by the [[CIA]], as he was considered a valuable asset by them, for conducting [[black ops]] on their behalf. Nevertheless, the court-martial proceeded with Kreigkopf ''in absentia'': he was dismissed from the Marine Corps and stripped of rank.

Kreigkopf fled to [[Grand Nixon Island]] in the [[South Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]], where he established a [[mercenary]] base and hired disgraced [[special forces]] & black ops operators, hitmen and sociopaths, as mercenaries and terrorists; a "black ops for hire" outfit, as Frank Castle put it. The most notable of these mercenaries was [[Russian (comics)|The Russian]], who was recently murdered by the Punisher, and resurrected with [[cyborg]] technology stolen from [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] As "payment" for his services, Kreigkopf allowed the Russian one more chance to kill the Punisher in revenge; the Russian failed in his mission and returned to Grand Nixon Island in time for Kreigkopf's plot to eliminate the [[European Union]] (EU) leaders in [[Brussels]], as revenge for their plotting to wipe out Kreigkopf and his terrorist group. When the Punisher foiled Kreigkopf's plot by shooting down a [[Boeing 747]] full of terrorists, Kreigkopf ordered the hijacking of a French military aircraft that was carrying a [[hydrogen bomb]] and have it destroy the EU leaders. As the French aircraft began to taxi down the runway, the Punisher confronted Kreigkopf on the runway and shot him in the shoulder, then Castle managed to board the aircraft and throw the Russian out with the nuclear weapon chained to him. Kreigkopf  watches and he yells in anger and horror that the Punisher destroyed his plans and the Punisher kills him with the nuclear weapon. The resulting nuclear explosion destroyed Grand Nixon Island, the terrorists, the Russian and Kreigkopf.

Two weeks later, the Punisher broke into the [[White House]] and directly confronted the [[President of the United States]], who had been [[blackmail]]ed by Kreigkopf; Kreigkopf had threatened to inform the media of black ops authorized by the President, the least of which was authorizing the Russian to eliminate the Punisher, and ordering the [[NYPD]] not to interfere. The Punisher gave the President a stern warning, and threw a [[9mm Parabellum]] round on the President's desk, saying "Nine millimeters. I'm never further away than that."

"Kreigkopf" is German for "Warhead", a [[double entendre]], referring to Kreigkopf's propensity for brutality, and the fact he confiscated a nuclear weapon.

====General Kreigkopf in other media====
Kreigkopf appeared in the 2005 ''[[The Punisher (2005 video game)|The Punisher]]'' video game, voiced by [[Bob Joles]]. He appears as one of the game's main antagonists.

===Holy===
First appeared in ''[[The Punisher (2000 series)|The Punisher vol. 4 #2]]''.

'''Father Hector Redondo''', who called himself "The Holy", was an insane [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[priest]] in [[East Harlem|Spanish Harlem]] who used a [[fireman's axe]] to kill criminals who confessed their sins to him. He believed killing "evil" people is [[God]]'s will, and was later inspired by the Punisher to form the Vigilante Squad, consisting of the Holy, Elite and Mr. Payback (the trio hoped that the Punisher would join and lead them). The media called him the mystery "Axe-Murderer of Spanish Harlem". Father Redondo realized that he was a killer and showed remorse after each of his murders, praying for absolution and forgiveness for his sins, only to subsequently commit more murders and pray after each one.

The Punisher used Detective Soap's notes to find Father Redondo, whose church was the place where all of the victims came to confess their sins. Not only did Castle find The Holy, but also Elite and Mr. Payback. By listening to their conversation, the Punisher found out Redondo was indeed the Axe-Murderer. The Punisher barged into The Holy's office to confront the Vigilante Squad, who attempted to recruit the Punisher as their leader, but Castle was unmoved by their pleas, accusing Redondo of being "a lunatic". Just after Redondo made the trio's final plea with the Punisher to reconsider, Castle gunned down all three members of the Vigilante Squad.

Like his partner Pittsy, Ink was just as callous and ruthless; however, Ink rarely spoke, but when he did, Cavella referred to Ink as a real "ballbuster". Ink was a skilled cook: he murdered, then butchered and cooked up the son of mob boss David Kai, who enjoyed his "sweet & sour pork" until Cavella told him what it really was. Ink's favorite word was "Huh", which he used whenever he agreed with something; it was also his last word when he was killed during a battle between Cavella's mobsters & CIA agents who were negotiating with Frank Castle; Cavella & Pittsy barely escaped with their lives, but were forced to leave Ink's body behind.

He also executed a wealthy banker who criticized Payback during a live TV news interview. Payback was highly intelligent: he made several highly articulate speeches about the exploitation of corporate laborers; shortly thereafter, Payback deduced the location of Elite's neighborhood and found Elite gunning down a marijuana dealer. Payback convinced Elite to join him, and the duo stumbled across The Holy, forming the Vigilante Squad.

Just as the Vigilante Squad decided that they needed the Punisher to lead them, the topic of discussion himself stormed into the room. An awed Mr. Payback told the Punisher that he was their inspiration. After insulting The Holy and Elite, the Punisher informed Payback that he had killed four innocent people during his quest for justice, to which Payback responded that there have to be sacrifices in war. After Payback gave the wrong answer, the Punisher pulled out his trademark [[Uzi]] and prepared to gun down the trio, who pleaded with the Punisher to reconsider their offer.

He was one of the few criminals to have survived an encounter with the Punisher. However, when he desecrated the Castle family's graves to lure out the Punisher so he can kill him once and for all, he was kidnapped by the Punisher, marched into the woods by Castle and shot in the belly, leaving him there to languish for days, dying slowly of blood poisoning.

Pittsy was extremely [[rudeness|rude]], [[profanity|profane]] and merciless, but was completely loyal to Cavella. He had an [[Threshold of pain|extremely high pain threshold & endurance]], on a level comparable to the Punisher himself, and was a very capable hand-to-hand combatant. During a three-way firefight between the Punisher, the CIA and Cavella's men, the Punisher threw Pittsy through a [[warehouse]] window and impaled him upon a spiked fence. To Castle's disbelief, Pittsy staggered towards Castle with a section of the fence still imbedded in him; Castle finished off Pittsy with a point-blank shotgun blast to the face. Shortly after Pittsy's death, his younger sister Teresa "Tessie" replaced her brother as Cavella's bodyguard. Tessie had the same rude & cold-blooded personality as her brother, but became enamored of Cavella and tried to seduce him; Cavella rebuffed Tessie's advances. Shortly thereafter, Tessie tracked down Frank Castle, who was in bed with Kathryn O'Brien, and attacked them both, managing to stab Castle in the shoulder while screaming that Castle had killed her brother.

==Zadkiel==
'''Zadkiel''' is a former [[archangel]] in the service of Heaven and an enemy of the [[Ghost Rider]], named after the [[Zadkiel|mythical angel of the same name]]. Created by [[Jason Aaron]], the [[fictional character|character]] debuted in ''[[Ghost Rider (comic book)|Ghost Rider]]'' vol. 4 #27.

Zadkiel was in charge of overseeing the Spirits of Vengeance in [[List of Marvel Comics characters: G#God|God]]'s army, and gradually developed a hatred of humanity as God favored the sinners over the angels.{{Issue|date=January 2011}} This led him to decide to overpower and dethrone God, something that he would need the power of Spirits of Vengeance to do. It was revealed that he had endowed [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]] with the powers of the Ghost Rider.{{Issue|date=June 2010}}

As a backup plan Zadkiel used Blaze's brother, [[Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)|Daniel Ketch]].<ref>''Ghost Rider: Danny Ketch'' #1 (2009). Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> Danny was once the host for the Ghost Rider entity, and after he had exorcised the spirit he went into withdrawal. Falling off the wagon Danny soon found himself once again host to a new variation of the Ghost Rider. Zadkiel had tricked Danny into believing that by killing other Spirits of Vengeance he would be freeing the human hosts. What Danny did not realize was that by destroying the Spirits of Vengeance, he was fueling Zadkiel, making him all-powerful.

Danny blindly led Zadkiel's army, the Black Host, into war with Blaze and the last remaining Ghost Riders. Danny and Blaze soon came into conflict, and Danny and Zadkiel's army were able to overpower Blaze and his allies. When Danny ascends to Heaven to deliver the last of the spirits, Zadkiel turns on him, casting him back to Earth.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3 #32. Marvel Comics .</ref> With his enhanced abilities, Zadkiel was able to apparently usurp the throne from God and instill himself as the new ruler of Heaven.<ref>"Last Stand of the Spirits of Vengeance", ''Ghost Riders'' #30. Marvel Comics.</ref>

His reign was short-lived, however, as Danny and Blaze had arrived in Heaven to challenge him. With the assistance of the deceased Ghost Riders of the past, the brothers were able to overthrow Zadkiel and return the Heaven to God; Zadkiel realized that though he might have been able to shift the power that fueled the Ghost Riders from its hosts, and even leech it from them, he could neither control nor destroy it, as only the one true God possessed that power, which he was not. Zadkiel is currently imprisoned in Hell, condemned by an enraged God for his treachery to be tortured for all eternity for his horrific crimes against Paradise and Creation.<ref name="Riders6">"Heaven's On Fire", ''Ghost Riders'' #6 (2009). Marvel Comics.</ref>

; Powers and abilities
Zadkiel has not revealed the full extent of his powers, but is essentially immortal. The sole ability he has demonstrated so far is that he can mutilate and destroy human souls.<ref>''[[Ghost Rider (comic book)|Ghost Rider]]'' vol. 6 #26. Marvel Comics.</ref> He did have a semblance of what seemed to be the Creator's power briefly and used the power to create havoc on Earth, erasing people from existence, though it is ultimately revealed that while he may have able to drain a portion of the power of the Spirits of Vengeance from them temporarily, he was not, and never would be, the one true God and could thus never truly claim dominion over Heaven for long, much less all Creation.<ref name="Riders6"/>

; Other versions
During the 2015 "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline, a variation of Zadkiel resides in the [[Battleworld]] domain of Doomstadt and works for [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] as the Killiseum's chief of security.<ref>''Ghost Racers'' #1</ref> As Arcade planned to destabilize [[Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes)|Robbie Reyes]], Zadkiel warned him that Robbie draws his power from a different source. After Robbie escapes with the help of the ghost of [[List of Marvel Comics characters: M#Eli Morrow|Eli Morrow]], Arcade orders Zadkiel to send the Ghost Racers to hunt him down.<ref>''Ghost Racers'' #2. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> When the Ghost Racers corner Robbie, Arcade kidnaps his brother [[List of Marvel Comics characters: R#Gabe Reyes|Gabe Reyes]] and plans to have him race in Robbie's place. This causes Robbie to return to the Killiseum.<ref>''Ghost Racers'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Once at the Killiseum, Zadkiel orders the Ghost Racers to kill Robbie and to unleash the Venus Compiler on him as well. When Robbie frees the other Ghost Racers, they help to destroy the Venus Compiler. Zadkiel plans to kill Gabe, but Robbie instead kills Zadkiel by consuming his soul.<ref>''Ghost Racers'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Zaladane==
'''Zaladane''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[Magic (paranormal)|sorceress]] and the high priestess of the [[Solar deity|sun god]] [[Garokk]], the Petrified Man. The character first appeared in ''Astonishing Tales'' #3 and was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Barry Windsor-Smith]]. She is the alleged sister of [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Polaris]], a claim made at a time when Polaris' own parentage had not yet been confirmed.

Zaladane was the war-like high priestess and queen of the [[Savage Land#Savage Land Races|Sun People]], who live in the [[Savage Land]]. She attempted to lead the Sun People in a war to conquer the peoples of the Savage Land. Her army's weapons were destroyed by [[Garokk]], so she attempted to force Garokk to do her bidding but was attacked by him. She was defeated by [[Ka-Zar (Kevin Plunder)|Ka-Zar]] and seemingly destroyed.<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Zaladane later reappeared, and magically transformed her captive Kirk Marston into Garokk, endowing him with the original Garokk's consciousness. She aided Garokk in attempting to unite the Savage Land tribes under his leadership. She captured the [[X-Men]] and Ka-Zar, but was thwarted by the X-Men.<ref>''[[The Uncanny X-Men]]'' #115. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Years later, Zaladane became the assistant of the [[High Evolutionary]] in his project to restore the Savage Land after its near destruction by the alien Terminus. Zaladane was allied with the [[Savage Land Mutates]] (Savage Land natives who had been given superhuman powers through artificially induced mutation by Magneto), and with them plotted to conquer the Savage Land.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' Annual #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In her quest for power she, with the help of the Mutate [[Worm (comics)|Worm]], enslaved many of the land's natives and abducted [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Polaris]] to steal her magnetic powers with some machinery supplied by [[Brainchild (comics)|Brainchild]]. It was here she claimed to Lorna that she was actually her "sister". Zaladane then led an army in an attempt to conquer the Savage Land. She captured Ka-Zar, [[Shanna the She-Devil|Shanna]], and various X-Men, but is defeated by them.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #249-250. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> When Lorna arrived at Muir Island after losing her magnetic powers, she was examined by [[Moira MacTaggert]] due to the sudden appearance of a new power mutation. Moira confirmed during testing that the only way Zaladane could have taken Lorna's powers away was if she was a biological sibling.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #254. Marvel Comics.</ref>

With Polaris' magnetic powers, Zaladane took over the Savage Land. She led her army and the Savage Land mutates against Magneto, Ka-Zar, [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], [[Nick Fury]], and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] forces in the Savage Land. She sought world domination, and captured Magneto, Shanna, and [[Nereel]], and attempted to steal Magneto's powers as well. After a series of attacks using the various tribes in that region they managed to distract Zaladane, allowing Magneto to use the machine to regain his power. Shortly afterwards, Magneto executed Zaladane, who was impaled by an object propelled by magnetic forces projected by Magneto. At the time of her death, neither Zaladane nor Magneto were aware of their potential blood relation.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #274-275. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Some time after Zaladane's death and the [[Shadow King]] incident, Polaris' powers were returned to her.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #280. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Zaladane is a sorceress with an extensive knowledge of sorcery, and the ability to wield and manipulate the forces of magic for an undefined variety of effects. She primarily has used these powers for mind control and limited energy projection. For a time she wielded the ability to control magnetic forces in a manner similar to Magneto, but of a more limited nature.

She claimed to be a mutate (a mutagenically altered human rather than a born mutant). However, the nature of her artificially induced mutation was never revealed. She was able to steal the powers of Polaris and Magneto for a time with the assistance of a machine.

Zaladane was trained in the combat skills of the Sun People. She sometimes wore body armor of an unknown composition, and wielded spears, and torch-bombs (chemically-filled incendiary bombs). She had access to various scientifically advanced equipment, including skysleds (advanced air vehicles), and devices such as the transmutator, formerly belonging to the [[High Evolutionary]] and modified by [[Brainchild (comics)|Brainchild]]. Zaladane also rode dinosaurs, pterodactyls, and diatrymas (giant flightless birds) trained to carry riders.

===Zaladane in other media===
Zaladane appeared in the ''[[X-Men: The Animated Series]]'' two-part episode "Savage Land, Strange Heart".{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} She worked with [[Garokk]] in a plot to free him. Eventually, the plot was stopped due to a fight between Garokk and [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]] that re-imprisoned Garrokk in the Savage Land.

===Kenji Uedo===
[[File:XMEN-Zero.jpg|thumb|right|Kenji Uedo]]
'''Zero''' first appeared in ''[[Hope Summers (comics)#Generation Hope|Generation Hope]]'' #1, in the final chapter of the "Five Lights" storyline, and the first storyline of the ''Generation Hope'' book, as a newly manifested mutant with dark intentions and a dangerous power. He was created by [[Matt Fraction]] and [[Kieron Gillen]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/newsarama/|title=Newsarama &#124; GamesRadar+|website=Newsarama}}</ref> and is one of the "Five Lights"—a group of mutants who manifested their abilities after the events of "[[X-Men: Second Coming|Second Coming]]".

Following his introduction, he, along with [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]], [[Velocidad (comics)|Velocidad]], [[Transonic (comics)|Transonic]], [[Oya (comics)|Oya]], and [[Primal (comics)|Primal]], began to feature in the series ''[[Generation Hope (comics)|Generation Hope]]''. He is the last of the Five Lights to join Hope's team, as the first storyline of the ''Generation Hope'' series involves the team getting his power under control.<ref name=gen1>''Generation Hope'' #1 (2011)</ref>  He continues to make appearances in ''The Uncanny X-Men'' as well.

From his introduction, Zero has seemed more distant from Hope and all the other Lights. He is the first of the Lights to acknowledge that Hope has changed them, possibly not for the better,<ref name=gen8>''Generation Hope'' #8</ref> and his dark tendencies appear to be heading him down the path of villainy. He has talked about betraying Hope,<ref name=gen8/> and he has mentioned that he believes he would be a lot like [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] and his [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood]] or [[Quentin Quire]] if he weren't tied to Hope.<ref name=gen10>''Generation Hope'' #10</ref> Additionally, whether subconsciously or not, he has created messages in his room talking about how there is "No Hope" and "No Future."<ref name=gen4>''Generation Hope'' #4</ref>

Kenji Uedo is a successful nineteen-year-old <ref name=gen9>''Generation Hope'' #9</ref> artist from [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], when his powers first appear. Though originally Kenji just seems to be a messy introvert with hygiene issues, his powers quickly manifest into uncontrollable organic tendrils, which kill his assistant and start to wreak havoc in Tokyo.<ref name=gen1/> Soon afterward, [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope]], and the other Lights arrive in Japan to find Kenji's organic tendrils destroying the city.  After Cyclops, Wolverine, and Rogue fail to contain Kenji, Hope heads into his lair to attempt to stabilize his powers, but Kenji attacks Hope by latching tendrils onto her head,<ref name=gen1/> which appears to cause an explosion that destroys most of Tokyo.<ref name=gen2>''Generation Hope'' #2</ref> However, this is an illusion, created on a telepathic plane by Kenji so he can live his fantasies. Hope mimics Kenji's power, and sees that Kenji has her pinned to a wall. Hope escapes, but is rendered unconscious by her powers; she is rescued by Velocidad before she falls to the ground.<ref name=gen2/>

Using his powers, Kenji becomes a large creature, and he begins to rampage through the city, ''à la'' an old monster movie. Hope soon awakens, and she and the other Lights demonstrate their teamwork by getting Hope close enough to Kenji to once again mimic his powers, all while keeping each other safe. Hope becomes a similar creature, and begins to battle Kenji while the two talk telepathically. Kenji scoffs at Hope, and sarcastically asks if she thinks she can save him. When she doesn't reply, Kenji realizes that she does think she can save him, but he tells her that he thinks it's too late. Despite this, Hope defeats Kenji and is able to get his powers under control via a touch, which knocks them both unconscious.<ref name=gen3>''Generation Hope'' #3</ref>

Kenji is taken to [[Utopia (comics)|Utopia]], where he is shown footage of the destruction he caused in Tokyo. Kenji is remorseful, admitting that he has fantasies of killing people, and he wants the X-Men's help to ensure that he never goes on a rampage again. After [[Emma Frost]] probes his mind, she convinces Cyclops that Kenji truly is remorseful, and Cyclops agrees to help Kenji. Later, after Hope says she's staying on Utopia, Kenji and the other Lights agree to do the same, but Kenji decides to remain more isolated than his teammates.<ref name=gen4/>

When a Sixth Light is discovered in [[Germany]], Hope and the Lights (including Kenji) head there to retrieve it. However, they find that the Light is actually a powerfully telepathic unborn infant, who has taken control of every person within the hospital its mother is staying at. Kenji hooks his tendrils into each of his teammates' necks, granting them immunity from the telepath's influence, and the group heads into the hospital, and convince the baby to be born. Hope touches the child, and its X-gene is suppressed until it hits puberty.<ref name=gen6>''Generation Hope'' #6</ref><ref>''Generation Hope'' #7</ref>

After Hope decides that each of the Lights needs their own codename, Kenji begins to consider his several options. At first, he suggests ''Derivative'' or ''Rei'' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]] for ''Zero,'' and a reference to [[Rei Ayanami]] from [[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]) before settling on simply ''Zero.'' Later, after Primal wins the right to stay on Utopia, Zero wonders if Primal truly is happy on Utopia or if he is faking it to remain close to Hope. He and Transonic acknowledge that Hope has changed them all, and Zero doesn't think it's quite right. He reveals that he had considered another codename to spit back at their "messiah": Judas.

Later, a Seventh Light appears in the [[United Kingdom]]. The Light is a boy named Zeeshan, whose skin appears to be melting from his body. One of Zeeshan's friends begin to tease him and begins to take photos and post them onto the [[internet]]. Though Hope and the Lights (including Zero) rush to the UK, the group is too late, as Zeeshan has already killed himself after his friend "ruined" his life. Four weeks later, Zero is seen outside that friend's apartment, sending a drone in to kill the boy. However, he is stopped by Wolverine, who tells him "It gets better, kid."

As he returns from an obviously tiring mission, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] encounters Hope and the Lights, including Zero, awaiting his return so they can start Combat Training class. Wolverine cancels the class he had no knowledge of, and instead asks them if they shouldn't be doing something more age appropriate.<ref>''X-Men: Schism'' #1</ref>

Zero is one of the X-Men to attend the opening of a Mutant History Museum, a group that includes several adult and younger mutants. He got there early, as he wanted to view the "classic design" of the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]]. He then criticizes the leaders of the world for restarting the Sentinel Program after [[Quentin Quire]] made them tell their darkest truths on television. He mentions that he believes that he would be a lot like Magneto and his Brotherhood or Quire if he weren't tied to Hope. When the Museum is attacked by the new [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], most of the X-Men are quickly defeated and Zero is nowhere to be seen. He reappears outside with Hope and the other Lights after Oya's "murder" of the Hellfire grunts. He asks Oya if she is okay, but she mortifies Zero, Hope, and the other Lights by only asking if there is anyone else she needs to kill.<ref name=gen10/>

The Schism event concludes with the separation of the X-Men into two different teams (one led by Cyclops and the other by Wolverine). Velocidad, Transonic, Primal, and Zero choose to stay on Utopia with Hope while Idie leaves with Wolverine for the rebuilt X-Mansion now named the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning. The team later gets two new members, Pixie and [[No-Girl]] (who becomes somewhat close to Zero for a brief period of time).{{issue|date=February 2015}}

During a training exercise Hope and the remaining lights on Utopia spar against the likes of Colossus, Storm, Magik, Namor, Psylocke, and Magneto. Zero goes too far and infuriates Magneto during the fight when he digs his techno-organic tendrils into the mutant's eyes. In retaliation Magneto tears Kenji apart by manipulating the metals in his body. To everyone's surprise, Kenji survives the vicious attack and literally pulls himself back together.{{issue|date=February 2015}}

Shortly after the sparring exercise Hope learns that the [[Stepford Cuckoos]] have discovered a new light in Pakistan and chose to keep it from her.

When The Lights are attacked by a group of [[Asteroid M#Fifth version.2FUtopia|Utopia]] residents jealous of the young team's status with the X-Men, [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope]] usurps Zero's control over his powers to force an end to the conflict.<ref name="GENHOPE15">''Generation Hope'' #15</ref> This incident galvanizes Zero's distrust of the young leader, who he believes means to subjugate all mutants with her immense power.<ref name="GENHOPE16">''Generation Hope'' #16</ref> Using implants he had placed into the brains of a number of Utopia inhabitants, he manipulates a large group of mutants into clamoring for Hope's death.

While traveling the globe, Storm discovered Kenji alive and well, but without the memory of his time among the X-Men. After several exams, it is discovered that Kenji had not died as everyone had thought. His power had restored him after the battle with Martha Johansson.<ref>''Storm'' vol. 3 #10</ref> Storm believed him and allowed him to stay, keeping him under close watch, but it didn't take long for Kenji to shatter his innocent facade. As it turned out Kenji was found by Davis Harmon, a cyborg and CEO of Eaglestar Industries, when the latter searched the ruins of Utopia to salvage its technology. Being held captive and tortured shattered Kenji's already fragile psyche and he began to blame the X-Men for his demise. Storm eventually took Harmon down and, unbeknownst to her, allowed Kenji to escape his underwater lab. Consumed with revenge, Kenji was disgusted that Storm was spreading hope and fellowship everywhere but had rejected him and let him die when he showed his true colors during his attack on Hope. He began to attack the school and simultaneously unleashed armies of his techno-organic "meat puppets" on the places around the world that Storm had recently helped. He connected himself to Storm so that she could watch her friends die but this only allowed Storm to use her powers on a global scale and she destroyed his armies. Defeated, Kenji tried to goad Storm into killing him, which would prove that her inclusive dream was a lie, because it could never include him. Storm refused and, still connected to his mind, showed Kenji that many of her friends, like Callisto and Forge, were once monsters, but still decided to fight for a better world. She also knew that, deep down, Kenji hoped the same could eventually be true of him. Kenji vanished, telling Storm that he'd see her around. Rachel Grey confirmed that his psionic presence was still in the area and was, surprisingly, at peace.<ref>''Storm'' vol. 3 #11</ref>

Zero ('''A'''mbient-Energy '''D'''ampening '''A'''ctualization '''M'''odule Unit Zero) is a fictional robot. Created by [[Louise Simonson]] and [[Rob Liefeld]], the character first appeared in ''The [[New Mutants]]'' #86 as a member of the [[Mutant Liberation Front]], and was killed in [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] #80.<ref>''Excalibur'' #80. Marvel Comics.</ref> However he has been rebuilt and serving [[Stryfe]] again. <ref>''X-Force'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Designed to be a [[Askani|Clan Askani]] peacekeeper, Zero is equipped with advanced scanners to help neutralize potential threats.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Zero also can [[Teleportation|teleport]], creating warps between two points through which it and others can travel, but can only maintain them for a short amount of time{{Issue|date=May 2009}}. Zero cannot teleport to any location it has not been to before.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #87. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Zero was created in the late 39th century, by the [[Askani]], as a prototype for the Ambient-energy Dampening Automated peacekeeping Mechanisms (ADAMs). Only one other ADAM was known: Ambient-Energy Dampening Actualization Module Unit Eleven, who would one day work for the Askani Clan Chosen. Zero was damaged and found by the mutant Stryfe, who opposed both the Askani and their enemies, the Neo-Canaanites. Stryfe reactivated Zero, and Zero would function as Stryfe's most trusted ally, bodyguard and, due to its ability to teleport, transportation. Its programming ensured complete obedience to Stryfe. When Stryfe's armies were defeated by the Neo-Canaanites, Stryfe and Zero fled, travelling back in time to the late 20th century. <ref>''X-Force'' #17. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the 20th century, Stryfe gathered several young mutants like himself, who were displeased with the way mutants were treated and formed the terrorist organization, the Mutant Liberation Front. Stryfe's technology and Zero's teleportation made the MLF one of the most dangerous organizations in existence and they were opposed by [[Nathan Summers|Cable]] and the [[New Mutants]] (later known as X-Force). Stryfe's wanted to take vengeance on everybody who had hurt him in his life. Most of the MLF was dismantled and captured. Stryfe was defeated on the moon and Zero disappeared and was deactivated.

Zero ended up in the possession of the arms dealer, Tolliver, an alias of [[Tyler Dayspring]], son of Cable. Zero was reactivated when the mercenaries [[Deadpool]], [[Copycat (comics)|Copycat]], [[Garrison Kane]] and [[Slayback (comic strip character)|Slayback]] were all looking for "the ultimate weapon", which turned out to be Zero. Zero was now capable of speech and following his original programming: peace-keeping. It scanned its surroundings for any object and person who were a threat to peace on Earth and eliminated Slayback. He was about to eliminate Deadpool as well, but Deadpool convinced Zero that he had potential for good as well by saving Copycat's life. Zero agreed and left. <ref>''Deadpool: The Circle Chase'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Zero joined Tyler Dayspring for a short while, helping him in finding out the true relationship between Cable and Stryfe.<ref>''Cable'' #6-8. Marvel Comics.</ref> but it left Tyler to go on its own quest: to achieve full sentience and become "alive". It sensed the potential to be alive in the techno-organic being known as [[Douglock]] and gave it independence from the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]]. Zero set out to teach Douglock about his new existence, but Zero was now hunted by killer androids, programmed by Stryfe to destroy Zero in case of his death. Zero and Douglock were assisted by Excalibur and together they tried to deactivate the androids from Stryfe's secret base below the Pentagon. Here, Zero realized that he had become sentient and also the reason why Stryfe wanted him killed: locked within his data-banks, Zero had all the secrets of the Legacy Virus, Stryfe's final "gift" to the world. This revelation activated Zero's self-destruct sequence and the killer androids in Stryfe's base. [[Shadowcat]] managed to remove the self-destruction device, but Zero realised that his sentience was a cruel joke played on him by Stryfe; it was just programmed to think it was alive. Zero sacrificed itself to protect Excalibur, Douglock and a family of innocents from the base's self-destruction, but in its last few moments on Earth, Stryfe showed his cruelty again: Zero was granted full sentience and had become truly alive, but also set off a self-destruct device in the base to kill Zero. As this happened, a recording of Stryfe delivered the taunting message, "Congratulations. You're human. For the next eight seconds." In its last moments on Earth, Zero transferred all of its memories to Douglock.<ref>''Excalibur'' #77-80. Marvel Comics.</ref>

So while its body was destroyed, the data that made up Zero's mind was still contained within the mind of Douglock (currently known as Warlock). After Zero's destruction, the Mutant Liberation Front reappeared. At one point they had multiple Zero androids working for them, but these probably were copies of the original.

==Zom==
{{redirect|Zom|the Jewish soup|Zom (food)}}
'''Zom''' is a [[fictional character]], a gigantic semi-humanoid demon who has clashed with [[Doctor Strange]]. Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Marie Severin]], he first appeared in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #156.

Created long ago by unknown forces, Zom is a massively powerful mystic entity who exists only to destroy.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #158 (July 1967)</ref> Possessing enough evil energy to disrupt the balance of the multiverse, it takes the combined efforts of [[Dormammu]] and [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]] to successfully banish him; Zom was fitted with the "Crown of Blindness" and the "Manacles of Living Bondage" before being imprisoned within a small mystic [[amphora]] in what Eternity described as a "world beyond all worlds" and a "time beyond all time".<ref>''Strange Tales'' #156 (May 1967). Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

In Dormammu's absence, his sister Umar assumed the Flames of Regency and all the powers of the Dark Dimension, and as she was not bound by the pact that prevented Dormammu from entering the 616-Universe, she transported herself to Earth with the intention of destroying Dr. Strange along with the planet. Knowing he had little chance against Umar in a straight mystic battle (as she was wielding power equal to that of Dormammu), he makes the risky gambit of intentionally releasing Zom in the hopes that the two evil entities would battle one another. Zom furiously attacks Strange and pursues him to Earth, and Umar hastily retreats to the Dark Dimension upon seeing the demon. Dr. Strange attempts to battle the menace alone, but it is the Living Tribunal that banishes Zom, wishing to prevent his evil energy from leaking into other dimensions.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #157 (June 1967). Marvel Comics.</ref>

When faced with the unstoppable rage of the [[Hulk]] during the "[[World War Hulk]]" storyline, Doctor Strange resorts to invoking Zom's essence into himself by drinking the contents of the amphora.<ref>''[[World War Hulk]]'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> He successfully channels them, severely battering the Hulk, but begins to lose control. He pauses to restrain the demon, allowing the Hulk to recover and knock him unconscious.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

After Doctor Strange's defeat, the infernal entity, severely depleted, resumes its mission to destroy the Earth dimension, and inhabits [[Iron Man]]'s discarded Hulkbuster armor to activate the latter's anti-matter doomsday device. Wong attempts to recapture it, assisted by [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], [[Namora]], [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]], and [[Amadeus Cho]]. Eventually, Cho tricks it into possessing his body so Angel can knock him out, allowing him to be successfully resealed.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol.3 #111. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the assault of [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]] on all of existence during the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, Amatsu-Mikaboshi attacks Doctor Strange, awakening his inner Zom.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #619.</ref> [[Marlo Chandler]] eventually frees Doctor Strange using the power derived from her connection with [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]].<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #620. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Zom has displayed innate magical power and mystical knowledge sufficient to overpower both Doctor Strange and Umar, magic users of the highest order;{{issue|date=April 2014}} additionally, the Living Tribunal was moved to intervene personally to dispatch him, something which typically does not happen unless the entire universe's existence is at stake.{{issue|date=April 2014}} He also possesses incredible physical strength, being able to shatter manacles set on him by Eternity himself;{{issue|date=April 2014}} and while channeling his power, Doctor Strange was strong enough to hold his own against the Hulk.{{issue|date=April 2014}} If he is defeated and not every piece of him is recaptured, each one can potentially grow into a new, complete Zom, provided it has sufficient magical power to feed on. He can also possess both inanimate objects and individuals, seemingly dominating even very powerful and trained wills with ease.{{issue|date=April 2014}}

==Zuri==
Zuri, a fictional [[Wakanda]]n, was created by [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Christopher Priest]] and [[Mark Texeira]] and first appeared in ''Black Panther'' vol. 3 #1 (Nov. 1998). He is very large, and is one of [[Black Panther (character)|King T'Challa (Black Panther's)]] many warriors. Despite his old age, he possesses great strength and is a master of armed and unarmed combat. He fought alongside [[T'Chaka]], who as his final act asked Zuri to watch over his son.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 3 #5</ref> It is implied that Zuri trained T'Challa at a young age.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 3 #3</ref> He, [[Okoye (comics)|Okoye]], and [[Nakia (comics)|Nakia]] accompany T'Challa to [[New York City]], where he meets and befriends their intended handler on foreign soil, [[Everett K. Ross]].<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 3 #1-2</ref>

Zuri notably has a slim grasp on contemporary culture. He often eats things raw, regardless of their origin, and his idea of "formal" clothing is, at least according to Ross, "Even BIGGER dead animal slung across shoulder".{{issue|date=June 2018}} He disapproves of T'Challa's previous relationship with a woman named Nikki Adams simply because she is not Wakandan.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 3 #5-6</ref> He does respect non-Wakandans, such as Ross, whom he views as a close friend.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 3 #7-8</ref> Zuri is killed by [[Morlun]].<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 5 #5</ref>

Zuri has super-strength,{{issue|date=June 2018}} and is also an expert hunter, skilled tracker, and a master at armed and hand-to-hand combat.

Zuri appeared in the film ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'', portrayed by [[Forest Whitaker]] as an adult<ref>{{cite web|url=https://collider.com/black-panther-forest-whitaker/|title=‘Black Panther’ Recruits Forest Whitaker, Daniel Kaluuya & ‘Civil War’ Standout Florence Kasumba|author=Foutch, Haleigh|website=Collider|date=October 8, 2016}}</ref> and by [[Denzel Whitaker]] when he is younger.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2018/02/all-the-easter-eggs-and-references-we-spotted-in-black-panther/|title=All the Easter Eggs and References We Spotted in Black Panther|last=Pritchard|first=Tom|publisher=[[Gizmodo]] UK|date=February 13, 2018|access-date=February 15, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215204038/http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2018/02/all-the-easter-eggs-and-references-we-spotted-in-black-panther/|archive-date=February 15, 2018|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> As a young man, Zuri posed as an American named James to tail N'Jobu, T'Chaka's brother and a traitor, and witnesses his death at T'Chaka's hands. Twenty-five years later, Zuri appoints T'Chaka's son T'Challa as the new king, and oversees T'Challa's fight with [[Man-Ape|M'Baku]] on challenge day by administering the liquid that removes the abilities the heart-shaped herb grants. When M'Baku is defeated, Zuri performs a ritual that involves the abilities' return. Zuri is the one to tell T'Challa the truth about [[Erik Killmonger]]'s parentage. Killmonger later kills Zuri when he attempts to protect T'Challa, blaming him for doing nothing to protect N'Jobu.

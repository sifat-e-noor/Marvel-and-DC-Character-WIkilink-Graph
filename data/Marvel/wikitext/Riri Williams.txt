== Fictional character biography ==

===Origins===
Riri Williams is a 15-year-old engineering student and the daughter of the late Riri Williams Sr. Following her father's death, Riri lives with her mother Ronnie and her paternal aunt Sharon in Chicago. A certified super-genius, she attends the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] on scholarship.<ref name="Invincible Iron Man #1">''Invincible Iron Man'' Vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref name="Invincible Iron Man #12">''Invincible Iron Man'' Vol. 3 #12. Marvel Comics.</ref> Working alone, Riri designs a suit of armor similar to the [[Iron Man's armor|Iron Man Armor]] using material stolen from campus. When campus security knocks at her door, she flees while wearing the suit.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' Vol. 3 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Williams prevents two inmates from escaping the New Mexico State Penitentiary, her suit is damaged.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' Vol. 3 #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> Upon returning to her mother's house, Riri continues to work on improving the suit, much to the dismay of her aunt. [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] hears of Riri's accomplishment and goes to meet her. During their meeting, Stark decides that he will endorse her decision to become a superhero.<ref name="Invincible Iron Man #12" />

===Post-"Civil War II"===
Appearing in her Rescue armor following the 2016 "[[Civil War II]]" storyline, [[Pepper Potts]] confronts Riri Williams and Tony Stark, who has transferred his consciousness into a device becoming an A.I., in an attempt to explain the problems of being a superhero. They are then attacked by Techno Golem and her Biohack Ninjas.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' Vol. 4 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> As Riri flees and Pepper fights them, Techno Golem tries to find out how Pepper knows Riri.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' Vol. 4 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Techno Golem's armor breaks and Tomoe tries to instead attack Riri, Pepper uses her Rescue armored gauntlets and knocks Tomoe out. When [[Sharon Carter]] formally meets Riri after the arrest of Tomoe and the Biohack Ninjas, Pepper tells Riri that they will talk again.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' Vol. 4 #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> Pepper Potts, [[Mary Jane Watson]], [[F.R.I.D.A.Y.|Friday]], the Tony Stark A.I., and Stark's biological mother Amanda Armstrong are in the Hall of Armor with Riri when she demonstrates her knowledge of each of the Iron Man armors. When Amanda Armstrong offers to allow Riri to use Tony Stark's labs as her base of operations, Riri is hesitant but Pepper encourages her. The next day at her home, Riri's family is visited by the head of M.I.T. She wants Riri to continue working there, as it has gotten sloppy since she left. Riri would also be allowed to use the laboratories at the school. After working in one of the labs, Riri asks the Tony Stark A.I. to find her something to blow off some steam. The Tony Stark A.I. locates [[Armadillo (comics)|Armadillo]] during a crime spree and Riri uses the Ironheart armor to defeat Armadillo. She is then approached by the [[Champions (2016 team)|Champions]], who offer her membership into their group.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' Vol. 4 #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==="Secret Empire"===
During the 2017 "[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]" storyline, Ironheart is seen fighting the Army of Evil during Hydra's takeover of the United States. [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]] has [[Blackout (Marcus Daniels)|Blackout]] surround Manhattan with [[Darkforce]] after enhancing him with the powers of the [[Darkhold]]. Riri sends a distress signal to all available heroes to meet her in [[Washington, DC|Washington, D.C.]] Ironheart and [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] II join up with the Champions to assist in the underground's fight against Hydra's takeover of the country. They later follow [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] when she makes her own plans for Captain America. During training, the young heroes disagree about Black Widow's brutality and mercilessness. The heroes later infiltrate a Hydra base to find someone crucial to Black Widow's plan. Black Widow later tells them that they are going to have to kill Steve Rogers, after Hydra destroys the Underground hideout. In Washington DC as their assault begins, [[Miles Morales|Spider-Man]] fights Captain America, but Black Widow intervenes and is killed. Just as Spider-Man is about to kill Steve Rogers, the others convince him to not do it and they all get arrested.<ref>''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' #0-7. Marvel Comics.</ref> She also helped the Champions search for survivors in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] after its destruction by Hydra.<ref>''Champions'' Vol. 2 #11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Champions''===
In a 2019 storyline, Riri is startled to learn that her android teammate [[Viv Vision]] has developed a crush on her, which initially revolts her due to internalized [[homophobia]].<ref>''Champions'' Vol. 2 #27. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, her mind – and that of several other Champions – is corrupted by [[Mephisto (Marvel Comics)|Mephisto]]'s son [[Blackheart]], turning her against her teammates.<ref>''Champions'' Vol. 3 #9 (November 2019). Marvel Comics.</ref> However, when Riri is about to destroy Viv, it is the latter's honest apology for not considering her feelings which snaps her out of Blackheart's control and finally makes her acknowledge Viv's affection.<ref>''Champions'' Vol. 3 #10 (December 2019). Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the 2020 "[[Outlawed (comics)|Outlawed]]" storyline, Ironheart is among the teenage superheroes affected by the Underage Superhuman Warfare Act that was drafted by Senator Geoffrey Patrick ever since Ms. Marvel was put in a coma during a fight with an Asgardian dragon. The established group C.R.A.D.L.E. raided her lab.<ref>''Outlawed'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==="Iron Man 2020"===
In the "[[Iron Man 2020 (event)|Iron Man 2020]]" arc, Riri is among the characters that Tony Stark in his form of Mark One has not returned the calls of.<ref>''Iron Man 2020'' Vol. 2 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> While abiding by the Underage Superhuman Warfare Act, Riri, her A.I. N.A.T.A.L.I.E. (who is based on Riri's late best friend Natalie) and Xavier King see people fleeing because the Intellicars have gone haywire. As Riri interfaces with the Intellicar, N.A.T.A.L.I.E. finds that its A.I. is corrupted with a bad code. As the Intellicar starts acting up again, Riri was able to find the reset code as the three Intellicars crash. N.A.T.A.L.I.E. informs Riri that the signal came from the cell phone of André Sims who is currently working as an intern at Stark Unlimited's Chicago branch. Three days later at Stark Unlimited's Chicago branch, Riri confronts André about the incident with the Intellicars. André denies all knowledge of the incident and states that Stark Unlimited is doing the people a favor.<ref name="Ironheart2020">''2020 Ironheart'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Back at her lab, Riri states to N.A.T.A.L.I.E. that she has sent her complaints to Stark Unlimited and nobody has responded yet. While debating on the next plan of action with N.A.T.A.L.I.E., Riri notices that she might be glitching out. Later that night, Riri informs Xavier that N.A.T.A.L.I.E might be suffering a glitch ever since the Intellicar incident. She then gets an alert that the Ironheart armor has been hijacked. It is shown that N.A.T.A.L.I.E. has hijacked the Ironheart armor and starts glitching when she confronts André.<ref name="Ironheart2020" /> Using the tracker in the Ironheart armor, Riri and Xavier enter Stark Unlimited where they avoid the Stark drones. They catch up to N.A.T.A.L.I.E. as Riri works to talk N.A.T.A.L.I.E. out of harming André as N.A.T.A.L.I.E. states that they can't be able to help people from being harmed by people like André. Riri states that she can't have N.A.T.A.L.I.E. doing away with André or else Riri would get arrested as she doesn't want to put her mom through that and lose N.A.T.A.L.I.E. Riri has no choice but to armor up as André recovers and blasts Xavier out the window. Ironheart manages to rescue Xavier and expose André's experiments. After watching the news revolving around the incident, Riri, N.A.T.A.L.I.E., and Xavier noticed that the Ironheart armor was listed as one of Stark Unlimited's prototypes as they suspect that Stark Unlimited covered up the fact that it was the real Ironheart. N.A.T.A.L.I.E's glitch was also taken care of. <ref>''2020 Ironheart'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Reception==
In October 2016, Marvel Comics and New York-based retailer [[Midtown Comics]] jointly decided to pull from circulation Campbell's variant cover of the first issue of ''[[The Invincible Iron Man (comics)|The Invincible Iron Man]]'', produced exclusively for that store, after previews of the cover were criticized for sexualizing the depicted character, 15-year-old Riri Williams.<ref>Couto, Anthony (October 20, 2016).

Campbell called the decision "unfortunate," explained that his rendition of the character was intended to depict "a sassy, coming-of-age young woman". He regarded the reaction to the cover as a "faux controversy", saying, "I gave her a sassy 'attitude'...'sexualizing' was not intended. This reaction is odd." [[Brian Michael Bendis]], the writer on the series, was pleased with the decision to pull the cover, saying that while he liked the face Campbell had drawn on Riri when he viewed the art as a work in progress, he disliked the completed art, saying, "Specialty covers are not in my purview and it was being produced separately from the work of the people involved in making the comic. Not to pass the buck but that’s the fact. If I had seen a sketch or something I would have voiced similar concerns. I am certain the next version will be amazing."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Flood |first1=Alison |date=October 21, 2016 |title=Marvel pulls Iron Man cover after accusations of 'sexualising' teenage girl |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/21/marvel-iron-man-cover-sexualised-j-scott-campbell-riri-williams?CMP=twt_gu |access-date=October 21, 2016}}</ref>

Criticism was levelled at the fact that the character was not only being written by a white man rather than a black woman, but also at how this underscored that there were no black female writers at all at Marvel Comics, and none who had ever written a monthly series published by the company.<ref name="Inverse" /><ref>{{Cite web |last=Riesman |first=Abraham |date=2016-07-07 |title=Geeks Are Angry About Iron Man Becoming a Black Girl — But Not for the Reason You'd Think |url=https://www.vulture.com/2016/07/iron-man-riri-williams-controversy.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190403071258/https://www.vulture.com/2016/07/iron-man-riri-williams-controversy.html |archive-date=2019-04-03 |access-date=2019-04-03 |website=[[Vulture.com|Vulture]]}}</ref>

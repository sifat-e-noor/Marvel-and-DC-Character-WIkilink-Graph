==Sabreclaw==
'''Sabreclaw''' is a character in the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe who first appeared in ''[[J2 (comics)|J2]]'' #8 (May 1999).<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=304}}</ref> He is the half-brother of [[Wild Thing (comics)|Wild Thing]] and the son of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].

The character has claws (similar to Sabretooth), a healing factor, enhanced physical capabilities, and a temper (similar to Wolverine). {{issue|date=December 2012}} His healing factor allows him to rapidly regenerate damaged or destroyed areas of his cellular structure and affords him virtual immunity to poisons and most drugs, as well as enhanced resistance to diseases. He has superhuman strength, naturally sharp fangs, and claws reinforced with [[adamantium]] sheaths.

==Gwenny Lou Sabuki==
Gwendolyne "Gwenny" Lou Sabuki was the second Golden Girl introduced by Marvel. She made her [[first appeared|first appearance]] in 1978, but her [[World War II]]-era character predates the post-war Golden Girl [[Betsy Ross (comics)|Betsy Ross]]. Created by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and [[penciller]] [[Frank Robbins]] in the [[Retcon]] series ''[[Invaders (comics)|The Invaders]]'' #26 (March 1978), she had appeared, sans power, as Gwenny Lou. She gained her powers in the following issue, #27 (April 1978), and went on to appear as Golden Girl in #28 (May 1978) and #38 (March 1979). A flashback story featuring her as one of the Kid Commandos is in ''[[All-New Invaders]]'' #6–7.

During World War II, teenaged Gwenny Lou Sabuki, daughter of [[Japanese-American]] scientist Dr. Sam Sabuki, was present at a stateside battle in which sidekicks [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|Bucky]] and [[Toro (comics)|Toro]] of the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] superhero team fought the supervillain [[Agent Axis (Marvel Comics)|Agent Axis]]. One of Dr. Sabuki's inventions accidentally gave Gwenny Lou and her friend David "Davey" Mitchell superhuman powers. Gwenny Lou gained the power to generate light and energy and the ability to project golden force beams from her hands. Mitchell gained the ability to spin at superhuman speeds. She became Golden Girl, and he became the [[Human Top (David Mitchell)|Human Top]].<ref>''The Invaders'' #27 (April 1978)</ref> The four youthful heroes defeated Agent Axis and later formed the Kid Commandos, who were allied with the adult Invaders.{{issue|date=August 2013}}

In one incident, the Kid Commandos also fought the Invaders because they disagreed with the military's use of a Tsunami Bomb, which would have caused too much collateral damage. The bomb was never used because the Invaders saw the testing site was populated with civilians.<ref>''All-New Invaders'' #6–7</ref>

Gwenny Lou later helped found the post-war organization known as the [[V-Battalion]]. Gwenny eventually changed her superhero name to '''Golden Woman''' before she died in 1961. Her son and her granddaughter became the superheroes Golden Sun and Goldfire, respectively, although Golden Sun died when his own daughter was five years old.<ref>''Citizen V and the V-Battalion'' #2 (July 2001)</ref> Another of Gwenny Lou's granddaughters eventually became the Japanese heroine Radiance.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.comicvine.com/articles/exclusive-james-robinson-talks-all-new-invaders-original-sin-and-new-characters/1100-148409/ | title= Exclusive: James Robinson Talks ALL-NEW INVADERS, Original Sin, and New Characters | first= Tony 'G-Man' |last= Guerrero |date= 28 March 2014 | website= ComicVine.com | access-date= 29 December 2014}}</ref>

==Savage Steel==
Disillusioned by the justice system and what they viewed as its lenient stance on crime, a number of [[New York City Police Department]] officers came together to form an organization that would kill criminals, rather than simply jailing them. Calling themselves the "Cabal," the group commissioned [[Iron Monger|Stane International]] to give them an edge in their crusade. Stane's company designed and manufactured a suit of powered armor, the "Savage Steel" battlesuit, based on technology stolen from [[Iron Man|Stark Enterprises]]. Different members of the Cabal all took turns wearing the suit, including Paul Trent and former members Harry Lennox, Johnny Leone, and Jimmy Zafar. Savage Steel was first seen battling [[Darkhawk]], and killed some drug dealers.<ref>''Darkhawk'' #4</ref> Savage Steel then tried to kill the [[Punisher]], battled the Punisher, Darkhawk, and weapons dealers.<ref>''Darkhawk'' #9</ref> Savage Steel attacked Phillippe Bazin during his trial, and was revealed as Harry Lennox.<ref>''Darkhawk'' #12</ref> The Cabal's creation of the Savage Steel identity is discovered.

'''Scintilla''' (originally named '''Midget''') is a member of the [[Shi'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (Marvel Comics)|Imperial Guard]]. Created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Dave Cockrum]], the character first appeared in ''X-Men'' #107 (October 1977). Scintilla has the ability to shrink to five percent of her normal size, and any size in between. Like many original members of the Imperial Guard, Scintilla is the analog of a character from [[DC Comics]]' [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]: in her case, [[Shrinking Violet (comics)|Shrinking Violet]]. <ref name=CBR>Cronin, Brian. [https://www.cbr.com/x-men-dark-phoenix-saga-shiar-imperial-guard/ "Comic Legends: Why New Imperial Guard Members in Dark Phoenix Saga?"], ''CBR'' (April 9, 2018).</ref>

Midget was amongst the first of the Imperial Guard encountered by the team of superhuman mutants known as the [[X-Men]] who sought to rescue the [[Lilandra Neramani|Princess Lilandra]] from her insane brother emperor [[D'Ken]]. Following the orders of their emperor, the Guard clashed with the X-Men on a nameless Shi'ar Empire planet, and were on the verge of winning when the band of interstellar freebooters known as the [[Starjammers]] arrived to turn the tide of battle in the X-Men's favor.<ref>"X-Men #107. </ref>

Sometime later, when [[Deathbird]] was empress, Midget joined the other Imperial Guard members in the battle against [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] and the Starjammers. Later, on Deathbird's behalf, Midget assisted the other Imperial Guardsmen in the battle against the X-Men and Starjammers, but was defeated by them.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men' 1991">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #274-277 (March – June 1991).</ref>

Midget is renamed '''Scintilla'''<ref>''Quasar'' #33 (April 1992).</ref> at the outset of [[Operation: Galactic Storm]], an intergalactic war between the Shi'ar and the [[Kree]]. The Imperial Guard are integral to the Sh'iar creating a massive super weapon — the "Nega-Bomb" — using Kree artifacts, including the original [[Mar-Vell|Captain Marvel]]'s [[Nega-Bands]], which the Guard steals from the dead hero's tomb. This bomb is capable of devastating an area equivalent to that of the Kree Empire (which is supposedly located throughout the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]]). Ultimately, the Nega Bomb device is successfully detonated, devastating the Kree Empire, with 98% of the Kree population dying instantaneously.<ref>''[[Wonder Man]]'' #9 (May 1992).</ref> The Shi'ar annex the remnants of the Kree Empire, with Deathbird becoming [[viceroy]] of the Kree territories.<ref>''The Avengers'' #347 (May 1992).</ref>

[[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]], a powerful mutant intent on conquering the Shi'ar Empire, fights the Guard beginning in ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #480 (2007). Tragically, Vulcan kills Cosmo and [[Smasher (Marvel Comics)|Smasher]] (and seemingly [[Pulsar (Marvel Comics)|Impulse]], [[Neutron (Marvel Comics)|Neutron]], and [[Titan (Imperial Guard)|Titan]]) before he is defeated by [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]], who puts out his left eye. Despite Scintilla's desire for revenge, Gladiator takes Vulcan into custody and imprisons him.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #480 (January 2007).</ref>

Scintilla has many further adventures with the Imperial Guard, in such storylines as "[[Emperor Vulcan]],"<ref>''Emperor Vulcan'' #1–5 (November 2007 – March 2008).</ref> "Secret Invasion,"<ref>''Secret Invasion: [[Inhumans]]'' #3–4 (December 2008 – January 2009).</ref> ''[[X-Men: Kingbreaker]],''<ref name=XMenKingbreaker>''X-Men: Kingbreaker'' #1–4 (February – May 2009).</ref> "[[War of Kings]],"<ref>''War of Kings'' (May – October 2009).</ref> and the "Trial of [[Jean Grey]]."<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #13 (May 2014).</ref>

{{main|Scorcher (comics)}}

==Scorpia==
'''Scorpia''' is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

'''Elaine Coll''' is recruited by [[Silvermane]] from a [[mental hospital]] to become the new Scorpion. She opts to call herself '''Scorpia''' instead and is given robotic armor which enhanced her strength and speed by 500 percent. Scorpia successfully brings [[Deathlok]] to Silvermane and is ordered to ambush Spider-Man and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], who had infiltrated their base. She wears them down but is then betrayed by Silvermane, who shoots her in the back. Scorpia follows Spider-Man and Daredevil to Silvermane's location and immediately attacks him. Mainframe, another of Silvermane's mercenaries, takes control of Scorpia's cybernetic enhancements and uses her to attack Spider-Man. However, she soon regained mobility and blasted Silvermane. An explosion created by [[Punisher|The Punisher]] knocked Scorpia off the building they were on, but a mentally conflicted Deathlok saved her. She then decided to flee the area rather than be put in prison.<ref>''Spider-Man: The Power of Terror'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Scorpia then joins the new [[Sinister Six]] (though there were seven members total). The team's main purpose was to stop [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]] from killing any more of Spider-Man's enemies. When Kaine disguised himself as Spider-Man and attacked Hobgoblin, Scorpia immediately joined the others in the battle. However, they were not accustomed to working together, much to Scorpia's disdain. Spider-Man eventually entered the battle and was able to defeat Scorpia. She also participated in another battle against Spider-Man with some of her former allies and new ones such as [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]] and [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O' Lantern]]. She was defeated when Spider-Man threw Jack O'Lantern at her.{{Issue|date=January 2011}}

Much later, Scorpia fights Spider-Man and [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], and is defeated when Black Cat rips off her tail.<ref>''Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> She later reveals that she was hired by Alberto Ortega, the head of a local drug syndicate.<ref>''Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]" storyline, Scorpia appears as one of the female villains in the employ of Caroline Le Fay. She helps fight off [[Thanos]]' forces and later battles the [[Fearless Defenders]].<ref>''Fearless Defenders'' #10</ref> Scorpia remained in Le Fay's employ afterward, acting as one of her bodyguards during a meeting with the Mercs for Money.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Cullen Bunn|penciller = Salva Espin|inker = Salva Espin|colorist = Guru-eFX|letterer = VC's Joe Sabino|editor = Jordan D.

During the "[[Hunted (comics)|Hunted]]" storyline, Scorpia is among the animal-themed characters that were captured by [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] and [[Black Ant|Black Ant]] for [[Kraven the Hunter]]'s Great Hunt, which is sponsored by [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]]'s company Arcade Industries. She was seen at a gathering held by [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 5) #19. Marvel Comics.</ref> She was later freed when Kraven the Hunter told Arcade to lower the force field around Central Park.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 5) #22. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Scorpia appears as a member of a female incarnation of the [[Sinister Syndicate]]. She states to [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Francine Frye]] that she heard about her frying the original Electro and stealing his schtick. The Sinister Syndicate begins its mission where they attack the F.E.A.S.T. building that Boomerang is volunteering at.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 5) #26. Marvel Comics.</ref> Beetle leads the Sinister Syndicate in attacking Boomerang. It was stated by Boomerang that he was the one who came up with the Sinister Syndicate name. After getting Aunt May to safety, Peter Parker changes into Spider-Man and helps Boomerang fight the Syndicate. The Syndicate starts doing their formation attack until Spider-Man accidentally sets off Boomerang's gaserang which knocks out Spider-Man enough for the Syndicate to make off with Boomerang. As Beetle has Electro write a proposal on how the Syndicate can use Boomerang as an example to the criminal underworld, Beetle leaves while calling Wilson Fisk that they caught Boomerang, as she is given the information on where the exchange can happen. Scorpia later mentioned to the Syndicate members that Rhino once refused to arm wrestle her.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 5) #27. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Beetle returns to the headquarters, Scorpia is present when Mayor Wilson Fisk brings the full force of New York City to their headquarters, demanding that they surrender Boomerang to him. The Syndicate then assists Spider-Man against Mayor Fisk's forces. After Spider-Man evacuates Boomerang, the Syndicate fights Mayor Fisk's forces while not killing them. The Syndicate is defeated and arrested by the police. Their transport is then attacked by an unknown assailant who frees them.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 5) #28. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Jim Evans===
'''Jim Evans''' is a successful apothecary in Dustville during the Old West. He began to date Sarah (the prettiest girl in town) until she began to neglect him upon stating that she already has a boyfriend in Matt Cody. Matt Cody was not pleased that Sarah went out with Jim and challenged him to a shootout. Jim drew his gun first and only managed to wing Matt in the left arm as Matt managed to shoot Jim's gun out of his hand. Matt then made Jim dance with his gun. Jim was humiliated and vowed revenge. Upon inventing a liquid paralytic that he can fire no matter where he would hit them, Jim took on the identity of Scorpion and embarked on a crime spree. Scorpion managed to hold up a stagecoach and the sound of his gun attracted the attention of [[Rawhide Kid]]. Rawhide Kid managed to tackle Scorpion who hit Rawhide Kid with a paralytic pellet and continued to rob the stagecoach where he made off with the payroll. Upon questioning the nearby town about Scorpion, Rawhide Kid learned that there had been an apothecary who had been around for four months which allowed Rawhide Kid to determine his identity. Rawhide Kid followed Jim to an abandoned mine, watched him change into Scorpion, and then confronted him. Their fight collapsed the mine and Rawhide Kid fell into an underground stream. Rawhide Kid recovered and went after Scorpion again. When Scorpion fired the paralytic pellet again, Rawhide Kid twisted Scorpion's wrist causing Scorpion to get hit by his own paralytic pellet. Rawhide Kid then turned Scorpion over to Dustville's sheriff.<ref>''Rawhide Kid'' #57. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After six months in jail, Jim Evans managed to mix up a small amount of his stun potion in the prison workshop. He used it on a guard, grabbed his keys, and escaped from jail. Taking on the alias of '''Sting-Ray''', Jim Evans went on another crime spree until he arrived in Bison Bend and decided to settle there as the base of his ultimate destiny as the Emperor of the West. Sting-Ray robbed a bunch of people at Bison Bend's square dance. Clay Riley and Sheriff Ben Brooks tried to stop him, but ended up victims of his stun pellets. Sting-Ray later kidnapped Sheriff Ben Brooks' daughter Natalie holding her hostage until he got the power he demanded. However, he was foiled by [[Phantom Rider]] who attacked Sting-Ray. Phantom Rider managed to defeat Sting-Ray and unmasked him after he was distracted by Natalie's shouting. The sheriff and his men arrived and chased after Phantom Rider.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #4.

Scared of Shriek's malice, the symbiote arm then rebonds to Tanis, creating the new hero Scorn, who defeats Shriek and forces her to use her sonic shriek to weaken Carnage who escapes.<ref name="CarnageFF" />

In ''Carnage USA'', Carnage invaded Doverton, Colorado and bonded to its citizens and the Avengers team (who originally tried to stop Carnage) to which the government send in the Mercury Team, a symbiote-enhanced special forces team bonded to the [[Agony (comics)|Agony]], [[Phage (comics)|Phage]], [[Riot (comics)|Riot]] and [[Lasher (comics)|Lasher]] symbiotes along with Dr. Tanis Nieves as Scorn to stop Carnage, but they are heavily outnumbered, since Carnage controls the entire town. The enhanced special forces keep fighting, but Carnage sends the controlled Avengers after them, that was when Spider-Man comes with the town's unaffected residents. The melee is particularly fierce when Agent Venom intervenes with sonic rounds. Scorn uses a construction vehicle to carry the two to a device she built and reveals that her device is meant to permanently remove the bonds from Carnage and Venom, but the hosts are still in there. After the symbiotes fight with themselves and the Avengers team, the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote finds its way back to [[Flash Thompson]] while Scorn is able to capture and contain the Carnage symbiote.<ref>''Carnage USA'' #3–5.

==Senyaka==
'''Suvik Senyaka''' is the first ever Sri Lankan character to appear in Marvel Comics, followed by Dr. Amara Perera.<ref>[http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Amara_Perera_(Earth-616) Amara Perera (Earth-616)]</ref> Senyaka first appeared in ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #300 and was created by [[Scott Lobdell]] and [[John Romita Jr.]]

Senyaka possesses the power to drain the bio-electrical essence of others upon physical contact. The living energy he drains augments his natural strength, endurance, and reflexes, as well as accelerating his recuperative powers significantly. Senyaka can also utilize the excess life-force he drains to generate a pair of psionic whips composed of bio-electric energy. These whips move according to his mental command and can greatly increase the distance of his absorption ability. The whips can also conduct his bio-electric energy to ignite nerve clusters in an opponent to cause intense pain or paralysis, as well as sear into their flesh.

Senyaka is a mutant recruited by [[Fabian Cortez]] as a member of a second group of the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]].<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #300</ref> On their first mission, this new team of Acolytes attacked the Our Mother of The Sacred Heart school while searching for a mutant child.<ref>''X-Force'' #92</ref> During the assault, Senyaka displeased his lord [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] after critically injuring a human nurse with his energy coils and was subsequently slain by Magneto, who crushed the life out of Senyaka with his own coils.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #304</ref>

Senyaka survived, however, by siphoning the life energy from agents from the international law enforcement agency known as [[SHIELD|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] who had recovered Senyaka's body. Seeking revenge on Magneto, Senyaka set out to kill sea captain Lee Forrester, a former paramour of the self-styled master of magnetism. Forrester teamed up with the mutant soldier from the future named [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], and Senyaka was seemingly killed once more in the ensuing battle.<ref>''Cable'' #11-12</ref>

Senyaka later reappeared once more as a member of a faction of Acolytes led by [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]], who has the ability to bring people back to life. The Acolytes participated in an assault on [[Wundagore|Wundagore Mountain]] in the European country of [[Transia]], home of the enigmatic scientist known as the [[High Evolutionary]]. The Evolutionary had developed a powerful mutagenic compound known as Isotope-E, which the Acolytes coveted for themselves.<ref>''Siege of Wundagore'' Crossover</ref>

After Exodus was defeated, Senyaka found himself amongst the ranks of former Acolytes who were aiding the Carrion Cove rebellion against Magneto's rule of the island nation of Genosha. With the genocide of the Genoshan population at the hands of giant mutant-hunting robot Sentinels controlled by [[Cassandra Nova]], the genetic twin of [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]], Senyaka was believed dead.<ref>''Magneto: Dark Seduction'' #1-2</ref>

Some time passed before Senyaka would return. Upon his return, the nature of which is still unknown, he joined the ranks of Exodus' new team of Acolytes. Following the [[X-Men]]'s battle against the Hecatomb, Senyaka appeared on Cable's decimated island nation of [[Providence (comics)|Providence]] alongside new Marauders, [[Gambit (Marvel Comics)|Gambit]] and [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]], in an attempt to claim the island's information archives, which would allow access to Cable's future technology. While Gambit and Sunfire faced Cable, Senyaka battled Deadpool and appeared to gain the upper hand before Deadpool was teleported away by Cable's technology.
<ref>''Cable and Deadpool'' #42</ref>

When [[Selene (comics)|Selene]] dispatches her Inner Circle to retrieve the mystical knife necessary to complete her ritual, Senyaka mortally wounds several mutants with death-related powers. At first, when she tries to fool him by appearing before him as a little girl, he tells her to drop her disguise as he will kill for her because she is different compared to the others he has served.<ref>''X-Necrosha: The Gathering'' #1</ref> They travel to Selene's birthplace, Rome and New York where they slaughter the members of that branch of the Hellfire Club. After being led to the ruins of Genosha by Caliban, Selene declares this is where she will become a goddess and renames it Necrosha.<ref>''X-Necrosha'' #1</ref>

When Selene dispatches her Inner Circle to retrieve the mystical knife necessary to complete her ritual, Senyaka mortally wounds Meld, then teams up with [[Blink (comics)|Blink]] to attack [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]], using his coils to restrain him, while Blink teleports his wings to shreds. Senyaka is later attacked by Wolverine, who drives his claws into his chest. Senyaka is unfazed by this, declaring he has been killed before. In the final fight, Senyaka ensnares Wolverine in his coils, slamming him in to walls. [[X-23]] releases him when she cuts Senyaka's arm off. Wolverine takes advantage of the situation, decapitating Senyaka.<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 3 #21-25</ref>

===Senyaka in other media===
* Senyaka made a cameo appearance in the ''[[X-Men: The Animated Series|X-Men]]'' episode "Secrets, Not Long Buried". Senyaka is one of the many residents of the mutant-dominated community of Skull Mesa.
* Senyaka first appears in the ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' episode "Greetings from Genosha". He is one of the many Acolytes of Magneto. In "Battle Lines", Senyaka and Pyro attack MRD Facility Beta in the Northwest to break out the mutants imprisoned there. He later battles [[Gambit (Marvel Comics)|Gambit]] in "Aces & Eights".

==Sepulchre==
'''Sepulchre''' (also known as '''Shadow Woman''') is a [[fictional]] [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She first appeared in ''[[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]'' #45 (April 1993), and was created by [[Mark Gruenwald]] and [[Grant Miehm]].

After a difficult childhood, Jillian Marie Woods left home to attend the [[University of San Francisco]]. While there, she met occult lecturer Anthony Ludgate Druid, the superhero known as [[Doctor Druid]]. They discovered that a psychic link existed between them. Druid probed Jillian's mind and learned her soul had inhabited a male alchemist in King Arthur's court in a past life, and that the alchemist loved a princess whose soul was reincarnated as Dr. Druid. The alchemist and princess were killed by the princess' brother because of their relationship, and the alchemist swore he would find the princess again. Jillian and Druid, surprised by these revelations, became lovers. Sometime later, Jillian accidentally released a demon, which killed her when she and Druid were investigating mystical artifacts Druid took from the sorcerer Magnus. Dr. Druid, using a mystical statue called the Bride of Slorioth, bonded a piece of Jillian's soul to her shadow. When Jillian woke up with her new powers, Druid told her that they were a result of her exposure to the demon.{{Issue|date=October 2009}}

Jillian took the name Shadow Woman and alongside other heroes [[Skull the Slayer|Jim Scully]] (as the second Blazing Skull) and [[N'Kantu, the Living Mummy]], joined a team, led by Dr. Druid called the Shock Troop. When [[Quagmire (comics)|Quagmire]], using his Darkforce, [[Neutron (Marvel Comics)|Neutron]], and the [[Presence (Marvel Comics)|Presence]] corrupted Earth-148611 (New Universe), Shadow Woman and the Shock Troop helped [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] fight Anti Bodies until the [[Shi'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (Marvel Comics)|Imperial Guard]] destroyed them. Later, the Shock Troop was called on by Doctor Strange to face a threat at the [[Nexus of All Realities]]. When the team arrived, the threat had already been neutralized by Quasar.{{Issue|date=October 2009}}

After [[Doctor Strange|Dr. Strange]] forced Dr. Druid to assume the responsibility of organizing the [[Secret Defenders]], Jillian, [[Luke Cage]] and [[Deadpool]] were assembled to prevent Malachi from reassembling the Moebius Stone. They met at the Chicago Museum of Art, and confronted Malachi as she attempted to acquire a Moebius Stone fragment attached to a sword. To hold back the Secret Defenders, Malachi animated artwork to attack them and departed with the fragment. Casting her shadow form over them, Shadow Woman caused them{{clarify|date=July 2018}} to dissipate. Druid then teleported them to his townhouse to seek artifacts which could aid them against Malachi.<ref>''The Secret Defenders'' #16</ref>

They set out to oppose Malachi at a tomb where a corpse held the last fragment of the Moebius Stone in a ring upon its finger. They were joined by Cody Fleisher, [[Cadaver (comics)|Cadaver]], a teenager Malachi killed who Agamotto re-animated to serve as his Pale Horseman. However, Malachi obtained the last fragment, and caught Shadow Woman and Dr. Druid with her spells. Shadow Woman was able to phase through her bonds, and distracted Malachi while Dr. Druid escaped. Malachi struck Shadow Woman down, and when she survived the blow, she realized she shouldn't have, and that Dr. Druid had done something to her. Malachi was finally slain by Deadpool, but then [[Strangers (Marvel Comics)|Strange]], Dr. Strange's servant, attempted to claim the Moebius Stone. Shadow Woman opposed him, only to be struck down again, but Dr. Druid was able to destroy the stone.<ref>''The Secret Defenders'' #17</ref>

Shadow Woman, Cadaver, Dr. Druid and R.G. Mathieson confronted [[Swarm (comics)|Swarm]], as it attempted to control the Rand-Meachum supercollider. Jillian was immune to Swarm due to her powers, and helped free Dr. Druid and Cadaver from the creature's clutches. She and Cadaver helped hold Swarm back long enough for Dr. Druid to convince Swarm to stand down.<ref>''The Secret Defenders'' #19</ref>

Returning from their encounter with Swarm, Jillian asked Dr. Druid to explain to her what she had become. Druid promised to do so, but cast her into the Bride of Slorioth. Within the statue, Jillian encountered the dark side of Dr. Druid's soul, and learned from it what Dr. Druid had done to her. She emerged from the statue furious, and assaulted Dr. Druid, but he convinced her that he had only done what had to be done, and that he was ready to lead her and Cadaver on a mission that would free them all of their respective curses. She agreed, but assumed the new alias of Sepulchre for that mission. Dr. Druid then teleported them to Starkesboro.{{Issue|date=October 2009}}

Sepulchre and the others met up with [[Deathlok]], [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Dagger]] and [[Drax the Destroyer|Drax]], their teammates for this mission. Dr. Druid led them to the Gates of Perdition, where he was to confront the demon Slorioth. However, as Dr. Druid departed, the original [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] — [[Silver Surfer]], [[Hulk]] and [[Sub-Mariner]] — appeared to oppose the Secret Defenders. Sepulchre engaged the Silver Surfer in battle, but he fled the scene when he realized he was in an era where [[Galactus]]'s barrier did not surround the Earth. However, the Surfer's conscience gnawed at him, and he returned to engage Sepulchre once more, but she encased him within a field of total darkness. Just then, their battle was interrupted when the demon Slorioth arose.<ref>''The Secret Defenders'' #20 – 22</ref>

The two teams of Defenders fought Slorioth, but Sepulchre and Cadaver were taken aside by [[Joshua Pryce]] to face the real threat — Dr. Druid, corrupted by his dark side. Dr. Druid claimed that everything he had done had been for Jillian, then attacked his one-time allies. Since Dr. Druid had taken control of her soul, he used that advantage to cause her to dissolve away. Ultimately, Joshua Pryce brought in the Vishanti and [[Living Tribunal]], who drove off Dr. Druid and Slorioth. Pryce then went to help Sepulchre, but she begged him to let her die. He replied, "Better to live, forever a Shadow woman...than to die a Sepulchre!", and helped raise her to life.<ref name="Secret Defenders #25">''The Secret Defenders'' #25</ref>

Sepulchre and Cadaver met with Pryce afterward, and decided to go their separate ways, but noted that "if the world ever needs saving...and all the good super-heroes are busy," they would meet again.<ref name="Secret Defenders #25"/>

Sometime later, Lindsay McCabe, a friend of [[Jessica Drew]]'s, asked Jillian to help her find her missing friend. They were joined by [[Julia Carpenter]], Spider-Woman, who had encountered Jessica's Spider-Woman costume moving of its own accord. Jillian sent the two women to the dimension of the Void-Eater, where Jessica was imprisoned. Re-powered by her costume, Jessica escaped the Void-Eater with Lindsay and Spider-Woman. Jillian closed the portal to the Void-Eater's realm before the creature could follow them back.<ref>''The Sensational Spider-Man 1996''</ref>

Jillian is seen on the phone with a representative from [[Roxxon Oil]], agreeing to speak to them about a job offer they had made.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #113</ref> She encounters the Thunderbolts on her way to the interview, and uses her powers to fight off [[Mac Gargan|Venom]] before teaming up with [[Steel Spider]] and [[American Eagle (Marvel Comics)|American Eagle]] to battle the rest of the team. Managing to reach Roxxon Oil just in time, she negotiates a new life off American soil.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #114</ref>

Sepulchre returned to America, following the collapse of Norman Osborn's regime and his Thunderbolts initiative, and was last seen participating in a job interview for a babysitter job with [[Jessica Jones]] and [[Luke Cage]], but gets increasingly frustrated with the apparent mispronunciation of her name, repeatedly telling Jones and Cage off and re-spelling her name over and over, which results in her eventual rejection.<ref>''The New Avengers'' vol.2 #7</ref>

[[Darkforce]] energy manipulation allows Jillian to fly, generate darkness fields, phase, and merge with shadows.

==S.H.O.C.==
Todd Fields/S.H.O.C. was created by [[Howard Mackie]] and [[John Romita Jr.]] in ''[[Spider-Man]]'' #76 (1997).

Todd Fields is the son of Dr. William Fields, who worked for [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] in project S.H.O.C. (Sub-dimensional Human-based Occultechnic Conduit). The idea behind it was to use a highly evolved technology connecting to the rather mysterious [[Darkforce|Darkforce dimension]]. It was made into an armor by Doctor William Fields, and it has the capabilities of [[Cloak and Dagger (characters)|Cloak]], as in shadow-melting and projecting the Darkforce energy into the armor to modify its form. Dr. Fields first subject was a man that would come to be known as [[Loxias Crown]], however Crown had his own hidden agenda and killed Dr. Fields along with many other Hydra agents and was planning to use the S.H.O.C.s technology to conquer the world. Todd was a young boy when he witnessed the death of his father, which traumatized him greatly. His father however left Todd with key components for Todd to track and steal another S.H.O.C. armor and bond with it. Todd then became SHOC and swore revenge on Crown for murdering his father. <ref>''Spider-Man'' Vol 1 79</ref>

After Todd saw his father murdered by agents of Hydra, he was devastated. Years later, as a grown man, he would become the new SHOC and a hero. He teamed up with [[Spider-Man]] several times and battled Don Fortunato for the whereabouts of Crown, and he was directed to [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]], who informed him that the living vampire [[Michael Morbius]] has been captured by Dr. Andrea Janson. Hammerhead killed Dr. Andrea Janson, Crown’s lover, to lure him out. During the confrontation, Hammerhead was badly injured and S.H.O.C. figured out a way to defeat Crown, by having him drain the power of the HYDRA’s ship, overloading him. Crown later returned as Hunger, a vampire, and battled [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] and Spider-Man. S.H.O.C. however was coming to terms with himself, since the armor was killing him, like it did with Crown.

While trying to get his life straight, Todd was ambushed by [[The Hand (comics)|the Hand]] and was killed, only to be resurrected, brainwashed and used as a weapon against [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] in ''Wolverine: Enemy of the State''. Luckily, SHIELD was able to stop the influence of Hydra and reverse the brainwash. His memory is slowly recovering, and he has become a hero once more. <ref>''Wolverine'' Vol 3 26-27 </ref>

The S.H.O.C. armor that he was bonded with allowed him access to high powered weapons that didn’t require reloading or recharging since it was powered by the Darkforce.

==Shotgun==
'''Shotgun''' ('''J.R. Walker''') is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]]. The character, created by [[Ann Nocenti]] and [[John Romita Jr.]], first appeared in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #271 (October 1989).

J.R. Walker was once a soldier in the [[United States Army]] before becoming an assassin working for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. The CIA and Skip Ash sent Shotgun to retrieve a young blonde woman known as Number 9. He wound up battling [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #272–273 (1989)</ref>

He has worked side by side with the [[Punisher]] at one point, teaming up to destroy the Carbone crime family. Shotgun had been hired to do this because the Carbone family were not the 'tame' Mafiosi that the government enjoyed. Shotgun saves the lives of the Punisher and ally [[Mickey Fondozzi]]. Shotgun and the Punisher then work to slaughter an isolated island full of international Mafia members. This particular battle results in the destruction of most of the Carbone family, with [[Rosalie Carbone]] being left in charge.<ref>''The Punisher War Zone'' #1–6 (1992)</ref>

An athletic man with no superhuman powers, Shotgun is a highly experienced hand-to-hand combatant and an expert marksman with most known firearms. Shotgun wears Kevlar (body armor) for protection. He uses a high-powered recoilless rifle firing a variety of explosive, concussive, combustible and disintegrative ammunition, and also has a specially-designed one-man tank. Shotgun's equipment was designed by Central Intelligence Agency weaponry research and design.

==Sibercat==
Siberian Tiger (renamed Sibercat in Soviet Super Soldiers #1) was a member of Father Garnoff's mutant underground in Russia. They worked with the original X-Factor to attack the Doppelganger's lab.

Later on, they helped the original mutant Soviet Super-Soldiers escape government capture. A cyborg named Firefox killed most of Illich's teammates, leading him and Father Garnoff to join with their new allies in the Super-Soldiers, forming a group alternately called the Exiles or Siberforce.

Sometime after that, Sibercat was made a member of the Winter Guard when Siberforce and the People's Protectorate merged into a single group. The group battled the Mandarin when his 'Dragon of Heaven' entered Russian airspace.

Sibercat's powers were a therianthropy like transformation into a feline/humanoid form. Sibercat's feline-like mutation gave him heightened strength, speed, agility, endurance, 'catlike' reflexes, enhanced senses, a healing factor, and claws.

Marvel Comics</ref> it wanted to take care of its seventh spawn after being cleansed by the Klyntar.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 3 #23. Marvel Comics</ref> The Symbiote kept this a secret to [[Eddie Brock]], until they were captured by the Symbiote Task Force, led by Claire Dixonbe working alongside the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]], who wanted to rebond with the Venom symbiote.<ref>''Venom'' #164. Marvel Comics</ref> Luckily, [[Jessica Drew|Spider-Woman]] came and saved Eddie along with the symbiote from the Task Force. Then Eddie with Venom went to [[Alchemax]] to give birth to the new spawn. However, due to the experimentation it went through, the symbiote had a difficult pregnancy and meanwhile Mac Gargan arrived at their location and changed his plan to kill the Venom symbiote and bond to its more powerful spawn. Fortunately, Eddie knocked out both Mac and agent Claire Dixon. After giving birth to the spawn, Eddie and Venom entrusted [[Liz Allan]] to take care of the symbiote.<ref>''Venom'' #165. Marvel Comics</ref>

The spawn was then nurtured and raised by its parent who had been visiting at Alchemax to make it good in contrast to its other offsprings.<ref>''Venom: First Host'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref> However, after Venom was taken away by its original host, the [[Kree]] soldier Tel-Kar,<ref>''Venom: First Host'' #2.

Then Eddie with Venom and Sleeper returned to Earth as M'Lanz returned to space. However, Tel-Kar had survived the explosion and planned to use the bioweapon on the humans, but Sleeper intervened and bonded to Tel-Kar, lobotomizing him in the process and turning him into a body that Sleeper can pilot. After that, Sleeper bid Eddie farewell and with Tel-Kar's spaceship decided to go explore the universe.<ref>''Venom: First Host'' #4-5. Marvel Comics</ref>

==Smart Alec==
'''Smart Alec''' ('''Alexander "Alec" Thorne''') is a fictional [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]]{{citation needed|reason=When was Smart Alec identified as a mutant?|date=December 2019}} in [[Marvel Comics]], and a member of [[Alpha Flight]]. He first appeared in ''Alpha Flight'' #1 (August 1983) and was created by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]. He was unidentified in his first appearance, and was not named until ''Alpha Flight'' #8.

The character subsequently appears in ''Alpha Flight'' #7 (February 1984), #11–13 (June – August 1984), and ''Alpha Flight Special'' (1992) in a flashback story.

Alec Thorne was born in [[London]], [[England]]. As a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], he was contacted by [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|James Hudson]] to be one of the first members to join Department H. Alec was also one of the first recruits to join [[The Flight (comics)|The Flight]], a precursor to Alpha Flight. In their first mission, they stopped the terrorist known as [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Egghead]] from launching a thermonuclear missile at the United States.<ref>''Alpha Flight Special'' (1992)</ref> Later, after Hudson divided the team into three smaller groups, Thorne (as '''Smart Alec''') began training in [[Gamma Flight]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #1 (1983)</ref>

Some time after Gamma Flight was disbanded, its members were contacted by [[Jerry Jaxon]] to join [[Omega Flight]] in his bid for vengeance against Hudson. During the fight between Omega Flight and Alpha Flight, Smart Alec was defeated when he looked in [[Shaman (comics)|Shaman]]'s magical medicine bag; the resulting mental shock shut down his mind. Shaman shrank him down to miniature size and placed him in the bag, until a way could be found to restore his mind.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #12 (1984)</ref>

[[Snowbird (comics)|Snowbird]] was later forced to kill [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] to vanquish the [[Great Beasts|Great Beast]], Tanaraq, who co-inhabited his body. His mind was eventually transferred into Box's robot body.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #24 (1985)</ref> Langkowski's mind eventually entered Thorne's tiny body in an attempt to return to the human world. Thorne's body was finally killed when Langkowski merged his mind into the [[Box (comics)|Box]] robot to defeat [[Pestilence (comics)|Pestilence]], whose freed mind had inhabited the body of Snowbird (who was in the form of Sasquatch at the time), before Langkowski took over the Sasquatch body.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #46 (1987)</ref>

Thorne invented and wore an encephala-helmet, which was used to increase his already super-genius intelligence level and boost his levels of perception (such as seeing across more than the mere visible light spectrum).

Smart Alec appears as part of the "Omega Flight" entry in ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition]]'' #9.

===Other versions of Smart Alec===
Smart Alec appears in ''What If?'' #62 (June 1994) titled "What If... Wolverine Battled Weapon X?" He is shown as a member of The Flight before being killed by Guy Desjardins, that reality's version of Weapon X.

King was a latent [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] and drug runner whose mutation was catalyzed when he spent several days out in the desert sun after his truck broke down.

Solarr hated Winslow, and when he found his corpse, he incinerated it. Bres used his magic to animate the charred corpse, which killed Solarr.<ref>''Power Man & Iron Fist'' #113</ref>

It was later revealed that Solarr was one of the possible targets of [[Scourge of the Underworld]], until Scourge found out that Solarr was already dead.<ref>''Captain America'' #320</ref>

==Space Phantom==
The '''Space Phantoms''' are the servants of [[Immortus]] in [[Marvel Comics]].

For many years it was assumed that there was only one Space Phantom, but in the course of the [[Avengers Forever|Destiny War]] the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] discovered that there was more than one. During a journey back in time to 1873, a trio of Space Phantoms was caught impersonating the [[Gunhawks]] and the [[Black Rider (comics)|Black Rider]].<ref>''Avengers Forever'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Space Phantoms were previously said to have originated on the planet Phantus,<ref>''Thor'' #281. Marvel Comics.</ref> in the Phalbo system in the Milky Way Galaxy.<ref>Phantom's entry in ''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' vol. 2 #15. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The first Space Phantom first appeared in ''The Avengers'' #2, copying [[Hank Pym|Giant-Man]], [[Iron Man]], and [[Hulk]]. During his battle with the Avengers, he first copied the Hulk, and battled Iron Man. He took the shape of a flying insect to escape, but Iron Man continued to battle the Hulk. The Space Phantom attacked the Wasp in his insect form, and then became Giant-Man. After fighting Iron Man, he took Iron Man's form. He finally attempted to copy [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and was banished back to Limbo because his powers couldn't affect [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardians]].<ref>''The Avengers'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Since all Space Phantoms appear identical and can appear as any other creature, it can be difficult to determine which Space Phantom did what; the following activities have previously been attributed to the Space Phantom who first encountered the Avengers, but these may not have been the same Space Phantom. A Space Phantom allied with the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]] and impersonated [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Madame Hydra]], and commanded a division of [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] in that identity. The Space Phantom battled the Avengers, but was shunted back into Limbo when he attempted to mimic [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], who was then linked to [[Mar-Vell|Captain Mar-Vell]].<ref>''The Avengers'' #106-108. Marvel Comics.</ref> A Space Phantom was compelled by Immortus to impersonate [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]] to deceive [[Kang the Conqueror|Kang]].<ref>''Giant-Size Avengers'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> A Space Phantom attempted to trick Thor into freeing the planet Phantus from Limbo, and allied with Thor to save Phantus, which led to Thor losing much of Mjolnir's power over time.<ref>''Thor'' #281-282. Marvel Comics.</ref> A Space Phantom once encountered [[Rom (comics)|Rom]] in Limbo.<ref>''Rom'' #19. Marvel Comics.</ref> A Space Phantom later encountered the Avengers in Limbo.<ref>''The Avengers'' #268. Marvel Comics.</ref> A Space Phantom was used as a pawn by the [[Young Gods (comics)|Young God]] Calculus in a scheme pitting [[Spider-Man]] against the Avengers.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #168-170. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The original Space Phantom is revealed to be disguised as [[Spider-Man]] in the ''[[Beyond!]]'' series.<ref>''Beyond!'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Ripley Ryan===
'''Ripley Ryan''' is a human who grew up in a home where she was not treated well by her mother Roberta. She was also bullied a lot growing up.<ref>''Star'' #5</ref> When Ripley became a reporter, she had her first encounter with [[Carol Danvers]] when they were attacked by Nuclear Man. He kidnapped Ryan and took her to Roosevelt Island. Carol pursued them with help from [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]], [[Echo (Marvel Comics)|Echo]], and [[Hazmat (comics)|Hazmat]].<ref name="Captain Marvel #1">''Captain Marvel'' Vol. 10 #1</ref> Ripley helped Captain Marvel and her allies defeat Nuclear Man<ref>''Captain Marvel'' Vol. 10 #5</ref>

At some point, Ripley Ryan found out about [[Doctor Minerva]]'s efforts to engineer humans so that they would become a hybrid of humans and Kree. Ripley volunteered herself to partake in these experiments.<ref name="Captain Marvel #10">''Captain Marvel'' Vol. 10 #10</ref> The experiment was a success, but Ryan had no superpowers. With help from Doctor Minerva, Ryan utilized the stolen powers from Captain Marvel at the time when she had unleashed a "Kraken" into New York City.<ref name="Captain Marvel #1"/> When Captain Marvel defeated the "Kraken", she got infected, with her powers being siphoned into Ryan. She became Star, who helped to fight an armada of "Kraken". Star's popularity rose, while Captain Marvel's popularity plummeted.<ref>''Captain Marvel Vol. 10 #8</ref> Star later found out about Doctor Minerva's plans to recruit Carol into fighting the possible extinction of the Kree and nearly killed Doctor Minerva with a message left in her own blood stating "You're not as smart as you think you are".<ref>''Captain Marvel'' Vol. 10 #9</ref> Following the attack, Captain Marvel brought Doctor Minerva to Stark Unlimited HQ so that she can get some medical treatment. After learning some information from Doctor Minerva, Captain Marvel went to confront Star in [[Times Square]]. As Captain Marvel fought Star, she got weaker due to the Power Siphoners. Captain Marvel ripped the device off her chest, which severed the connection and caused both of them to fall to the ground. Star revealed to Captain Marvel that she released the virus into New York City so that she can draw on the powers of all the New Yorkers.<ref name="Captain Marvel #10"/> Captain Marvel defeated Star by ripping the Power Siphoner off of Star's chest. While it seemed that she was remanded to the Raft, it turned out that Star had somehow merged with the [[Infinity Gems|Reality Gem]] and escaped.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' Vol. 10 #11</ref>

Star later visited the Bar With No Name, where she got into a fight with [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Titania]]. She was defeated due to her inexperience with the Reality Gem and is thrown out where Star was knocked out by [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]]. While in a warehouse, Loki attempted to remove the Reality Gem from Star to no avail as he states that other people have come for the Infinity Gems. When Star asks who would come for them, Loki listed a lot of names. Star thanks Loki for the information and attempts to destroy him. Star tries to enlist [[Jessica Jones]] to help her, only to be turned down due to recalling what she did to Captain Marvel. Both of them fought until [[Scarlet Witch]] broke up the fight and stated to Star that she is destroying reality.<ref>''Star'' #1</ref>

During the "[[King in Black]]" storyline, Mayor [[Kingpin (character)|Wilson Fisk]] forms his incarnation of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] to escort Star, the current keeper of one of the Infinity Gems, into battle to kill [[Knull (character)|Knull]]. To do that, they'll first need to make contact with a man Kingpin believes can help turn the tide against the [[Symbiote (comics)|Symbiote]] god. Star and [[Mister Fear]] are able to defeat a Symbiote Dragon. Star and the Thunderbolts make their way to Ravencroft Institute, where the man that would help in defeating Knull turns out to be [[Norman Osborn]].<ref>''King in Black: Thunderbolts'' #1</ref>

'''Starbolt''' is a warrior serving in the [[Shi'ar]] Imperial Guard, a multi-ethnic group of super-powered alien beings who act as enforcers of the laws of the Shi'ar Empire. Created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Dave Cockrum]], the character first appeared in ''X-Men'' #107 (October 1977). Like many original members of the Imperial Guard, Starbolt is the analog of a character from [[DC Comics]]' [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]: in his case [[Sun Boy]]<ref name=CBR/> (although some sources think his analog is [[Wildfire (Drake Burroughs)|Wildfire]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2020}} Starbolt can fly and project energy bolts from hands.

Part of the division of the Imperial Guard known as the Superguardians, Starbolt was amongst the first of the Imperial Guard encountered by the team of superhuman mutant adventurers known as the X-Men who sought to rescue the Princess-Majestrix Lilandra from her insane brother, then-Majestor D'ken. Following the orders of their emperor, the Guard clashed with the [[X-Men]] on a nameless Shi'ar Empire planet and was on the verge of winning when the band of interstellar freebooters known as the [[Starjammers]] arrived to turn the tide of battle in the X-Men's favor. During the clash, Starbolt became enraged when he saw the feral X-Man [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] attacking his teammate and then-lover [[Oracle (Marvel Comics)|Oracle]]. After Starbolt flash-fried him, Wolverine quickly took the two lovers out of the fight by slamming them into each other.<ref name="X-Men #107. Marvel Comics">''X-Men'' #107 (October 1977).</ref>

Starbolt is featured prominently in an adventure set early in his career; the Guard and the current ruler of the Shi'ar empire are set upon by Skrull assassins and are rescued by the hero later known as [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]].<ref>''Untold Legend of Captain Marvel'' #1-3 (April – June 1997).</ref>

Starbolt was also one of eight Imperial Guardsmen chosen to battle the X-Men in a trial by combat over the fate of [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]], a primal force of the cosmos that had assumed the form of the X-Man [[Jean Grey]].<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #137 (September 1980).</ref>

Soon after, Starbolt was amongst those few Imperial Guard members who opposed the treacherous Shi'ar High Council member Lord Samédàr, who was aiding an attempted coup of the Shi'ar throne by [[Deathbird]]. Even after many of the Guard chose to side with Samédàr, Starbolt remained steadfast in his loyalty to then-Empress [[Lilandra Neramani|Lilandra]]. These Imperial Guard members went on a mission to find Lilandra, and joined with [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Kitty Pryde]] in battling Samédàr's renegade Imperial Guardsmen. Starbolt was captured, but was freed on Lilandra's command.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #157-158 (May – June 1982).</ref>

Later, after the formerly-exiled Deathbird had usurped the Shi'ar throne, Starbolt was amongst those Imperial Guard members who clashed with the British team of costumed adventurers known as [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] and the [[Starjammers]] over the fate of the then-bearer of the cosmic Phoenix Force, the alternate future daughter of Jean Grey named [[Rachel Summers]].<ref>''X-Men: Spotlight on... Starjammers'' #2 (June 1990).</ref>

Much later, the intergalactic teleporter [[Lila Cheney]] transported the X-Men to the Shi'ar Empire at the behest of then-Empress Deathbird. On Deathbird's behalf, Starbolt and the Imperial Guardsmen battled the X-Men and Starjammers, but the X-Men had arrived in Shi'ar space just in time to see Lilandra regain her throne. Not all was as it seemed, however, as in reality a group of [[Skrull|Warskrulls]], using technology to allow them to duplicate superpowers, had captured and impersonated the X-Men's founder, the telepathic Professor Charles Xavier, using his telepathy to control Lilandra, and the Imperial Guard, including Starbolt. After the ruse was discovered by the X-Men and all the Warskrull impostors were exposed, Lilandra settled matters with Deathbird, discovering her sister did not want the throne anymore.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men' 1991"/>

Elektra kills Stone by tricking him into walking under a tree that he previously attacked, as Elektra used her weight to bring it down on him.

==Kron Stone==
There are two different versions of '''Kron Stone''' that appear in [[Marvel Comics]] and exist in the [[Marvel 2099]] reality. He is the older half-brother of [[Spider-Man 2099|Miguel O'Hara / Spider-Man]] and eldest son of Tyler Stone.

===Original 2099 version===
As a child, Kron was continually abused by the android [[Housekeeper (servant)|housekeeper]], which mistook him for a dog. As a result, he later became a bully, taking enjoyment in other people's pain. The relationship between the two brothers is so conflicted that Miguel tried to kill Kron at one point. In his introduction, Stone ordered [[Punisher 2099|Jake Gallows]]' family to be killed. Gallows found Stone and fatally wounded him with a knife as revenge, before dumping his body into the sewer.<ref>''Punisher 2099'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> As Kron laid dying in the sewer, his body brushed up against a black ball. The ball then bonded to him and formed a new [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)#Marvel 2099|Venom]]. The symbiote was described as having mutated over the years, and displayed new abilities in this timeline, including acidic blood and saliva.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' #35. Marvel Comics.</ref> With this new power, Stone sought to emotionally torture Miguel—whom Kron never discovered was his half-brother—by hurting those close, going so far as to kill Miguel's former love Dana—who was also Tyler's lover. After a fight between Spider-Man and Venom, the former emerged as the victor, using loudspeakers to neutralize Venom, who was subsequently taken to the lab for study. It was revealed that the symbiote bonded with Kron on a molecular level, giving Kron an amorphous physiology that allowed his body to take on the properties of the symbiote itself.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' #37. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Timestorm 2009-2099 version===
A variation of Stone appears in the ''[[Timestorm 2009–2099]]'' as the alternate [[Marvel 2099]] reality version of [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]]. Stone was one of Miguel's nightmares during high school, a bully used to do whatever he wanted thanks to the influence of his father ready to solve any trouble the son caused. One evening, Kron was tormenting the lab animals in an [[Alchemax]] laboratory, using the powerful instruments found there. While toying with a gene splicer, Stone was attacked by a sudden surge of energy, resulting in an explosion, and his DNA was fused with that of a lab [[scorpion]]. The incident transformed Stone in a hulkling and monstrous beast, with his reason lost and the powerful instinct of an arachnid to guide him. Rejected by his father, he becomes obsessed with finding a way to reverse his mutation.<ref>''Timestorm: 2009–2099'' #1–3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Kron Stone in other media===

Despite this, Spider-Man is able to defeat him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/vgstories.13289.sdcc_2010~colon~_spider-man_sd_updates|title=San Diego Comic-Con 2010: Spider-Man: Shattered Dimension Updates|access-date=July 22, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723174322/http://marvel.com/news/vgstories.13289.sdcc_2010~colon~_spider-man_sd_updates|archive-date=July 23, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Deadly Villains of Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2010/09/03/the-deadly-villains-of-spider-man-shattered-dimensions?page=9|publisher=IGN}}</ref>

==Subbie==
'''Subbie''' is an amphibious boy who grew up in the depths of the ocean, and appeared in ''[[Kid Komics]]'' #1-2.

==Sublime==
'''Sublime''' (also known as '''John Sublime'''), is a [[supervillain]] (a [[Sentience|sentient]] [[bacterium]]). The character is usually depicted as an enemy of the [[X-Men]], and first appeared in the ''[[New X-Men (2001 series)|New X-Men]] [[Annual publication|Annual]] 2001''. As Dr. John Sublime, Sublime is the self-appointed name of a sentient [[bacteria]]l life form that arose during the beginnings of life on [[Earth]]. With the rise of [[Multicellular organism|multicellular lifeforms]], Sublime found endless numbers of hosts it could infect. Sublime is not a typical sapient but a sentient microscopic bacterial colony that can possess the body of any living organism, and manipulate both psyche and physical appearance. Other abilities include mass mind control, personal genetic manipulation (which allows for accelerated healing), cellular shapeshifting, as well as performing any number of power enhancements. 

It was hinted that the very hatred and fear of mutants was caused by Sublime itself. But the bacteria took more direct actions to ensure that the mutant population would be held in check, if not exterminated, to keep it from becoming the dominant species of the planet.

The first step was the [[Weapon Plus|Weapon Plus Project]]. Sublime took over a human body, dubbed Dr. John Sublime, and became the director of the Program, overseeing the creation of living weapons created by each installation of the program, from Captain America (Weapon I) to the Super-Sentinels - [[Fantomex]], Huntsman, and Ultimaton (Weapon XIII, Weapon XII, and Weapon XV), passing through [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Nuke]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], and [[Deadpool]], the latter two originating in the Weapon X Project, seemingly the most prolific living weapons producer.

For many years, Sublime remained behind the scenes, manipulating the Weapon Plus Project and installing [[Malcolm Colcord]] as the Director of Weapon X, which would eventually lead to the so-called War of the Programs between Colcord's replacement, [[Brent Jackson|Agent Brent Jackson]], and Sublime, as Weapon X became an independent organization.

As millions of mutants were born worldwide, Sublime, still under the identity of John Sublime, took other steps to ensure the extermination of mutantkind. One of these steps was the creation of the ''TransSpecies Movement'' a.k.a. ''Homo Perfectus'', a cult of humans that sought to empower themselves by grafting mutant body parts to their own bodies, but outwardly a group of 'mutants born in human bodies'. The militant faction of this group, the [[U-Men (comics)|U-Men]], refused to have any sort of contact with the world, which they considered impure, for which they sealed themselves in containment suits.<ref name="annual">''New X-Men Annual'' 2001</ref>

During a trip to [[Hong Kong]]'s new office of the [[X-Corporation]] to investigate the murder of [[Risque (comics)|Risque]], the [[X-Men]] discovered Sublime's farm of mutant prisoners. They were being harvested for mutant body parts which could give the U-Men powers. Sublime, who was in the country on a book tour, thus became aware of the X-Men's immediate threat to his plans. Sublime also tried to purchase the mutant healer [[Xorn]] in one such prison in [[China]].<ref name="annual"/>

Although Xorn was rescued by the X-Men, he was a mole. Xorn, who was revealed to apparently be [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], became addicted to the drug '''"Kick"''', made from concentrated doses of Sublime's body. Xorn dealt the drug to [[Quentin Quire]], thus placing Quire under Sublime's influence, which would cause the Open Day Riots made by the Omega Gang, and which led to the death of Sophie of the [[Stepford Cuckoos]] and [[Dummy (Marvel Comics)|Dummy]], the bodiless, gaseous-form student of Xorn.<ref>''New X-Men'' #137</ref>

Meanwhile, Sublime and the U-Men spread their influence to [[New York City]], where they kidnapped the telepath [[Martha Johansson]], harvested her still-living brain, and used it as a weapon against the X-Men. Cyclops and [[Emma Frost]], the White Queen, were kidnapped and tortured. They were sent off to be dissected, but escaped and confronted Sublime in his office. Emma, angry, held Sublime off a high ledge. Johansson forced Sublime to fall from Emma Frost's grip to his apparent death. The Sublime organism survived, regenerated its host body, and returned to actively overseeing Weapon Plus, as always, from the shadows.<ref>''New X-Men'' #120</ref>

Sublime suffered a setback in its plans with the destruction of two of Weapon Plus' ''Super-Sentinels'' ([[Huntsman (Weapon XII)|Huntsman]]/Weapon XII and [[Ultimaton]]/Weapon XV) and the defection of Fantomex (Weapon XIII). Sublime had envisioned a team of mutant-hunters with scripted actions operating from a space station (a section of [[Asteroid M]]) to make the genocide of mutantkind look like a "[[Saturday morning cartoon]] come to life". Weapon XII had already been destroyed during its test-drive; Fantomex, intended to be the smart, cool member of the team, refused to be anybody's weapon. Only Ultimaton remained, and even though he followed the direction of Weapon Plus operatives, he had begun to question his role as a slaughter machine but was ultimately killed by Wolverine.<ref>''New X-Men'' #146</ref>

Under the influence of Sublime via Kick, Xorn revealed himself to be Magneto, and assembled a new [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] to lay waste to the Xavier Institute and then New York City. They were defeated by the X-Men, but Xorn-Magneto, under Sublime's influence, killed [[Jean Grey]], who was manifesting the powers of the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]]. Unbeknownst to all, the Phoenix was the ultimate threat to Sublime's plan. In retaliation for Jean's murder, Xorn-Magneto was beheaded by [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].<ref>''New X-Men'' #150</ref>

Later, [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]], an X-Man who had infiltrated Colcord's Weapon X organization, was ordered to assassinate Sublime by Brent Jackson, an [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent turned Weapon X field leader. Chamber incinerated Sublime, but Sublime again regenerated. At the same time, Sublime was also responsible for sending [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] against [[Mister Sinister]] to obtain Sinister's latest creations, the Children (not to be confused with the Children of the Vault, a thematically similar team of characters but different in origin).{{Issue|date=May 2011}}

With the massive [[Decimation (comics)|depowering]] of mutants following the [[House of M]], mutantkind's threat to Sublime has been greatly diminished. However, it remains to be seen if the depowered mutants lost their innate immunity to the Sublime infection. In any event, Sublime appears as a computer-generated image and personality in ''[[X-Men: Phoenix - Warsong]]'' where he greets the remaining Stepford Cuckoos at The World, the base of operations for the Weapon Plus. He confirms that the Cuckoos are part of the larger Weapon XIV, the "Thousand-in-One," a telepathic gestalt of one thousand cloned daughters based on the [[ovum|ova]] of Emma Frost, taken by John Sublime years earlier when she was comatose. He facilitates the transfer of the Phoenix Force into all one thousand clones and uses robots to stop the X-Men, though "he" is defeated.<ref>''X-Men: Phoenix - Warsong'' #1 - 5</ref>

Sublime was responsible for the birth of the [[Stepford Cuckoos]], extracting thousands of eggs from the ovaries of Emma Frost and harvesting them into humanoid/nanite hybrids designed to be killing machines. The hub of his program, the five sisters, were sent to the Xavier institute to be trained in the use of their telepathic legacy.

John Sublime returned in a new human host and surrendered himself to the X-Men, hoping they could fight his sister, Arkea.

===Alternate versions of Sublime===
In the ''[[Here Comes Tomorrow]]'' timeline, after Jean Grey's death and Xorn's apparent death, Professor X left the Xavier Institute to rebuild the island of [[Genosha]], and a broken Cyclops declined Emma Frost's offer to jointly run the Xavier Institute. The new '''[[Beast (comics)|Beast]]''' became the new Headmaster and faced many troubles in his attempt to teach new generations of mutants and to fight for the Dream. The stress resulted in Hank consuming Kick and, subsequently, becoming the new host for Sublime. In this new host body, Sublime waged a war against mutant kind and the X-Men, destroying the Xavier Institute in the process.<ref>''New X-Men'' #151</ref>

===Sublime in other media===
Sublime appears in ''[[Marvel Anime|Marvel Anime: X-Men]],'' voiced by [[Troy Baker]] in the English dubbed version. This version is a white-haired human with a mechanical eye that is associated with the U-Men. He and the U-Men member Kick were abducting mutants to harvest their organs. After the X-Men had killed Kick, Sublime later ambushes them in the mountains while piloting a robotic armor that can use the X-Men's powers against them. Beast manages to find the robotic armor's weak point, allowing the others to defeat him. They discover that he has a mutant detection device before Sublime self-destructs himself.

John Sublime appears in the video game ''[[X-Men: Destiny]],'' voiced by Joel Spence. John Sublime is shown to be associated with the U-Men. He transforms into a gigantic monster after injecting himself with a serum of concentrated "X-Genes" that grants him mutant powers. Sublime presumably dies in the ensuing fight.

==Sugar Man==
'''Sugar Man''' is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] villain created by writer [[Scott Lobdell]] and artist [[Chris Bachalo]], and first appeared in ''[[Generation Next (comics)|Generation Next]]'' #2 (April 1995).<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=360}}</ref>

Sugar Man first appeared during "[[Age of Apocalypse]]", an event that caused Marvel Universe's history to diverge. Although many of the storyline's characters were alternate versions of existing heroes and villains, Sugar Man does not appear to have an [[Earth-616]] counterpart.

=== Fictional character biography ===
==== Age of Apocalypse ====
Sugar Man hails from the dystopian reality of the Age of Apocalypse, where [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] conquered North America and set up a system in which mutants ruled. Little to nothing is known about this twisted figure's childhood. With his grotesque appearance and psychotic personality, Sugar Man quickly earned himself a reputation as a brilliant geneticist, as well as a sadistic torturer under [[Mister Sinister]] direction, and like his teacher, Sugar Man so too had built secret labs all however North America, with one at [[Niagara Falls]] where he regularly torments his human slaves.<ref>''X-Man'' Annual 1996</ref>

Sugar Man was later placed in charge of Pacific Northwest's human slave camp, the "Seattle Core". [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] needed a mutant with time travel powers to go back in time to restore reality's proper order before [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]]'s death, whose existence was revealed by [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]], a displaced mutant from Earth-616. Apocalypse had already killed all mutants with chrono-variant powers to prevent anyone from undermining his [[regime]], but [[M (Marvel Comics)|Know-It-All]] was able to locate one with latent powers: [[Magik (comics)|Illyana Rasputin]], the sister of Generation Next's leader, [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]].{{issue|date=September 2021}}

Magneto sends the fledgling group, Generation Next, to the Core in an attempt to rescue her. During their mission, Sugar Man encounters and kills several of the members, including Vincente and [[Mondo (comics)|Mondo]]. During the process, Sugar Man is seemingly destroyed. In reality, however, he lost most of his mass and shrank to a minuscule size. He hides in Colossus' boot during the assault on Apocalypse's citadel.{{issue|date=September 2021}}

In the 2000 ''Blink'' limited series, a flashback reveals that Sugar Man was once the jailer in charge of cellmates [[Illyana Rasputin]] and [[Blink (comics)|Blink]] (before she was rescued as a young girl by Weapon-X and Sabretooth) in a prison facility where he regularly experiments with them.

==== Arrival in Earth-616 ====
During the assault on Apocalypse's citadel, Sugar Man takes advantage of the chaos to escape by jumping into the [[M'Kraan Crystal]], the "Nexus of all realities". He arrives in the [[Earth-616]] timeline, arriving in an unspecified location some twenty years in the past. With no apparent counterpart in this universe and no-one to remember him, Sugar Man travels to [[Genosha]] where he continues his genetics work behind the scenes. At some point, he approached Dr. David Moreau, a scientist who lived and worked on Genosha. Using techniques developed in his home reality, the Sugar Man sold his work on the Mutate bonding process to Dr. Moreau. Dr. Moreau, who would go on to be called the Genegineer, used the process to turn the mutant inhabitants of Genosha into mindless slaves. Years later, when the X-Men helped topple Dr. Moreau and the Genoshan government, ending the enslavement of mutants, they remained completely unaware of the existence of the Sugar Man or his role in the creation of the Mutate process. As the months and years passed, the Sugar Man quietly orchestrated things in his favor during the more peaceful government run by Sasha Ryan.

Eventually, this government falls into a brutal civil war. When the mutant team Excalibur is investigating the first Mutate slave of Genosha, they almost learn the secret of the Sugar Man; however, this is thwarted when Sugar Man activates a device that kills the Mutate before his involvement can be revealed.<ref>''X-Men Prime'' #1</ref> When Excalibur continues to keep searching for the secret history of Genosha, Sugar Man prevents them by destroying the master computer holding the information.<ref>''Excalibur'' #87</ref>

==== Operating from the Shadows ====
Detecting that [[Nate Grey|X-Man]], another refugee from Earth-295, is active in Earth-616, Sugar-Man sends his agent Rex to eliminate him to maintain his anonymity.<ref>''X-Man'' #6</ref> Much to his frustration, the first assassination attempt is interrupted by Selene.<ref>''X-Man'' #7</ref> Sugar Man then attempts to capture [[Havok (comics)|Alex Summers]], using a copycat of the deceased Scarlet McKenzie as his operative. She fails, and he eventually gives up after learning that another refugee from "The Age of Apocalypse", [[Dark Beast|Beast]], now calling himself "Dark Beast", is also trying to capture him.<ref>''X-Factor #113''</ref>

When Nate Grey's Earth-616 counterpart, Cable, travels to Genosha and becomes involved, Sugar Man believes him to be Nate and decides to reveal himself following 20 years of secrecy.<ref>''Cable'' #26</ref> Sugar Man realizes he was wrong and concludes that someone is manipulating the events to uncover his secret when Cable discovers his lab, forcing Sugar Man to activate the self-destruct mechanism in his lab.<ref>''Cable'' #27</ref> As [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], Jenny Ransome, Phillip Moreau, and the brainwashed ex-Magistrate [[Pipeline (comics)|Pipeline]] try to deactivate the bomb, Sugar Man captures Phillip Moreau. Sugar Man's plans for Phillip remain unknown. With the database destroyed, Sugar Man's existence is kept secret. The clues themselves were passed to Phillip by [[Mister Sinister]], who had long suspected that the Genosha mutate process was based on his own genetic research.<ref>'' Cable'' #28</ref>

After nearly coming face-to-face with 616's Mr. Sinister in Genosha, Sugar-Man begins working with the Dark Beast to keep their existence secret: Sinister learning that they are the ones who are using his techniques in 616 would work against them. In this vein, they target Bishop, who retains memories from the Age of Apocalypse.<ref>''X-Men'' #48</ref> After the failed attempt to slay Bishop by using the Dark Beast's operative Fatale, the two refugees part company.<ref>''X-Men'' #49</ref>

==== Return to the Age of Apocalypse ====
Sugar Man returns to Earth-295's past [[The Age of Apocalypse|Earth-295]] by utilizing a hyper dimensional device. After succeeding, he quickly resumes experimentation on a super-virus that he hopes to bring back to Earth-616 to wipe out humanity. Unfortunately for Sugar Man, Nate Grey follows him and, with the help of Magneto and Forge, thwarts his plot and sends him back to Earth-616.<ref>''X-Man'' Annual #1996</ref>

==== The Fall of Genosha ====
Back in 616, Sugar Man and the other refugees from Earth-295 are targeted by the [[Shi'ar]] empire, who see Holocaust's embedded shard of the M'Kraan Crystal as sacrilege. When the shard is removed, all refugees are sent back to Earth.<ref>''X-Man'' Annual #1997</ref>

Afterward, Genosha is quickly destroyed by the wild [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]], directed by [[Cassandra Nova]]. The whereabouts of Sugar Man are unknown until he reappears in Genosha, killing a band of Magistrates who are exploring the island with the Dark Beast. Callisto and Karima Shapandar confront Sugar Man and apparently kill him with a pipe through the head.

==== Endangered Species ====
He recovers from Calisto's attack and is one of the villains contacted by Beast when he is trying to reverse the effects of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]]. Sugar Man declines, saying that Beast can't afford him.<ref>''X-Men'' #200</ref>

==== Recent activities ====
After Dark Reign, Sugar Man leaves his hideout to find the device known as the "Omega Machine". He finds the device in an abandoned H.A.M.M.E.R. facility with, to his delight, Nate Grey hooked up to it.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #25</ref> He remakes the device to open portals to other realities and begins creating technologically derived mutates as part of his experiments while he tries to reach Earth-295, the Age of Apocalypse.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #26</ref> Realizing that the only way Sugar Man will leave him alone is to give him what he wanted, Nate uses all of his strength and willpower to open a portal to 295; before Sugar Man can escape into it, he is forced to return to 616 by [[Danielle Moonstar|Moonstar]], where he is taken into custody by [[Captain America|Captain Steve Rogers]].<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #27</ref>

===Return to the Age of Apocalypse===
Sugar Man is released from prison by Dark Beast. They rebuild the dimensional portal technology and return to the Age of Apocalypse, where the two use the energies of the life seed to resurrect a number of fallen mutants to provide [[Alternative versions of Wolverine#Age of Apocalypse|Weapon Omega]] an army.<ref>''Age of Apocalypse'' #2</ref>

The Human Resistance later captures Sugar Man and gives him to Penance in exchange for her co-operation. Penance plans to reform Sugar Man and utilize his science in her reformation of society.

==== Secret Wars ====
Sugar Man was believed to have stayed on the Age of Apocalypse when the reality was closed from the Multiverse during the X-Termination event, but in the lead-up to the incursion between the Earth-616 Earth and [[Earth-1610]] as seen in the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, he had managed to return to Earth-616 before its closure and has been in hiding since then. Believing that the villain has the means to boost his magnetic abilities, [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] seeks him out. Sugar Man is able to unveil a set of mobile power amplifiers with the intention of selling them to Magneto. Magneto, however, takes the technology violently and impales Sugar Man with numerous metal pipes, leaving him barely alive.<ref>''Magneto'' vol. 3 #19</ref>

==== Apocalypse Wars ====
While investigating the mysterious appearance of 600 new mutant signatures, Colossus takes a group of younger mutants to investigate. During the investigation, they discover that Sugar Man has created the new mutants and plans on traveling to the future with them where he will raise and control them, but are able to thwarted his plans.<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #8</ref>

Sugar Man was also revealed to be associated with [[Chance (comics)|Chance]] and his airborne casino for criminals, the Palace.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (Vol. 5) #39</ref>

==== Death ====
Bishop, later receives a warning about an unspecified, imminent event that would have catastrophic consequences on the X-Men's timeline which lead him to Sugar Man's lab where the X-Man had a quick confrontation with the frightened villain before getting knocked unconscious. By the time Bishop woke up, Sugar Man was dead, with his body split in two.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 5 #1 (2018)</ref>

====Powers and abilities====
Sugar Man is a mutant who possesses superhuman strength, four arms, hands with razor-sharp claws, a giant mouth full of razor-sharp teeth, and a dense, razor-sharp tongue of indeterminate length that fused with bio-energy able to pierce and damage stone, steel, and even non-solid objects such as gas and liquid. It is unknown if all of his abilities, as well as his bizarre physical appearance, are a natural part of his mutation, or later additions through genetic tampering.

He has an enhanced sense of smell and can use it to detect fear.

He can control his own body size and mass.

Sugar Man also possesses advanced regenerative abilities.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Marvel Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded}}</ref>

Sugar Man is an expert, at least by modern standards, in sciences including biology and genetics.

====Other versions====
=====X-Babies=====
In the dimension ruled by [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]], [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]] encounters childlike versions of the [[Age of Apocalypse]] villains, including Sugar Man. These entities seem to be created by Mojo himself, though he has lost control of them.

==Sway==
'''Sway''' ('''Suzanne Chan''') is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She first appeared in ''[[X-Men: Deadly Genesis]]'' #3 as one of the "Missing X-Men". She was created by writer [[Ed Brubaker]] and artist [[Pete Woods]].

Originally from [[Hong Kong]], David and Emily Chan became [[naturalized citizen]]s of the [[United States]] after living twenty years in [[California]]. They had a daughter named Suzanne, who, at 17 years old, wanted to attend [[Barnard College]] on the east coast of the United States and planned a trip to [[New York City]] to prove to her parents that she would be safe on her own after moving. During the trip, David and Emily were gunned down in a crossfire between gangs in [[Chinatown]]. Although standing a few feet from her parents, Suzanne was unscathed, which perplexed police detectives.

After the shooting, Suzanne entered a state of [[Post-traumatic stress disorder|shock]]. She could only dwell on the fact that when the shooting started, she had somehow stopped the bullets in midair and was able to get herself out of the path of the bullets. In actuality, she had stopped time around the bullets, effectively freezing them in place. Unfortunately, she was unable to do the same for her parents, and could only watch as the bullets tore into them.

The police placed the traumatized girl in a hospital for forty-eight-hour observation, during which she mostly slept and cried. When she was released, she was told that the police were looking into things, but they did not have any leads. Wandering the streets, she returned to the spot where her parents were killed. Suddenly, her mutant powers activated again, and she was able to see past events in the area, namely the phantoms of herself and her parents. After witnessing the shooting for a second time, Suzanne followed the phantom car, carrying her parents’ murderers, throughout the city. She then realized that she somehow had control over the flow of time, and she was making it replay itself for her.<ref>''X-Men: Deadly Genesis'' #3</ref>

Suzanne followed the murderers to their front door, and inside she could see them celebrating. She called the police, and when they arrived, the killers opened fire. Consciously using her power for the first time, she froze the bullets and the killers in time. After giving her statement to the police, the detective contacted [[Moira MacTaggert|Dr. Moira MacTaggert]], who then offered Suzanne a chance to train in the use of her mutant abilities. She took the code-name Sway and went with MacTaggert. She was in the first team, along with [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Kid Vulcan]], [[Darwin (comics)|Darwin]], and [[Petra (comics)|Petra]] to attempt to rescue the [[X-Men]] from [[Krakoa]], but was sliced in half by the island's force. With the last of her power, she and the mortally wounded Petra combined their powers to save their remaining teammates from certain death.<ref>''X-Men: Deadly Genesis'' #6</ref>

When the X-Men established Krakoa as a mutant paradise, Sway was among the revived mutants living there. She, Petra, and Vulcan were residing in the Summer House.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 5 #8</ref>

During the "[[Empyre]]" storyline, Sway and Petra have a drink with Vulcan at the Summer House on the Moon. After Vulcan defeated his [[Cotati (comics)|Cotati]] attackers, Sway and Petra catch up to him.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 5 #10</ref>

Sway demonstrated the ability to decelerate and probably stop or even accelerate time around her body, as well as a form of [[Retrocognition|retrocognitive]] projection that allowed her to replay the recent pasts as short bursts of ghostly images. It's highly possible her powers revolve either around the manipulation of gravitation as means for spacetime curvature or the control of [[chroniton]]s, much like [[Tempo (comics)|Tempo]], another time-manipulating mutant. By focusing carefully, Suzanne was able to slow down and stop objects entirely, enabling her to freeze projectiles in mid-air, immobilize her enemies, and various other effects. Apparently, Suzanne's training had honed her abilities to the point where she could target specific objects in her range or everything within a certain radius.

==Margali Szardos==
'''Margali Szardos''', also known as '''Margali of the Winding Way''', '''Red Queen''' or '''Fata Morgana''', is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]] Annual'' #4, and was created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[John Romita Jr.]] based on sketches by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]. Margali is [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]'s adopted mother. She is also the biological mother of [[Amanda Sefton]], formerly known as Daytripper and the second [[Magik (comics)|Magik]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2014/06/05/what-if-john-byrne-designed-nightcrawlers-mother-by-accident/|title = What if John Byrne Designed Nightcrawler's Mother by Accident?|date = 5 June 2014}}</ref>

Margali Szardos' past is as much of an enigma as she is. She was supposedly born in Paris, France and taught magic by her mother, but she has yet to reveal her true origins. Margali's particular discipline of magic is called 'The Winding Way.' <ref>Uncanny X-Men Annual #4</ref>

Once having been married, Szardos has two children: Stefan and Jimaine (aka [[Amanda Sefton]]). She supposedly had an affair with the demonic mutant [[Azazel (Marvel Comics)|Azazel]] who, at the time, had also seduced [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], who was then posing as the wife of Baron Christian Wagner. The Baron, who was infertile, suspected his wife of infidelity and, when the pain of childbirth caused Mystique to shift back to her natural form and deliver a devilish-looking child, the locals rose up against mother and son. Mystique fled, throwing the child over a waterfall, where he was later found and adopted by Margali. Whether she knew the child's origins or not, she raised the boy as her own.<ref>''Excalibur'' #83</ref>

Working at Der Jahrmarkt as a fortune-teller to cover her tracks, Margali discovered that the Demon [[Belasco (comics)|Belasco]] was sowing seeds of destruction into the Earth. She tricked her daughter into staying with her in Der Jahrmarkt by killing Sabu, Jimaine and Kurt's trapeze mentor. A day after Sabu's death, Kurt left Der Jahrmarkt to start a new life with the X-Men. Jimaine followed him to America and changed her name to Amanda Sefton, taking a job as a flight attendant. She and Kurt have since had an on-again, off-again relationship.

Years later, Margali learned that Kurt had killed Stefan. Too deep in grief to question why, Margali exiled Nightcrawler's soul to a dimension resembling "Dante's Inferno." With help from Jimaine and [[Doctor Strange]], Kurt was exonerated.<ref>''Excalibur'' #99</ref>

During Margali's time of weakness on The Winding Way, she was captured by the demon [[D'Spayre]]. After being rescued by Jimaine and Nightcrawler, Margali began her quest to take possession of a magical weapon called the Soulsword. Margali tricked her daughter once again by giving her a warning about a sorcerer called Gravemoss who was trying to kill all above him on The Winding Way. Amanda travelled to Muir Island and found that Gravemoss had possessed Kurt. After defeating Gravemoss, Amanda gave her mother the Soulsword and Margali used it to kill all the other sorcerers stationed above her. Amanda then joined Excalibur under the code name Daytripper.

Hoping to release a demon under London, Margali joined the U.K. branch of the Hellfire Club as the [[Red Queen (comics)|Red Queen]] and kidnapped the mutant hybrid Douglock. Her efforts were foiled by Excalibur and Margali disappeared only to be captured by Belasco. With her last bit of magic, she swapped souls with her daughter. Margali's soul, now in Amanda's body, took Nightcrawler to [[Otherplace|Limbo]], where they were able to rescue her body and defeat Belasco. After the battle, Nightcrawler returned to the X-Men and Margali left Amanda to rule Limbo. Amanda then took the name Magik for herself.

Margali has reappeared recently to find Nightmare torturing her daughter. Nightmare was under control of a demon called Hive who was looking for the Soulsword. Nightcrawler was able to defeat Hive with the help of Margali, Jimaine and Nightmare. During the battle, Margali revealed that Nightcrawler possessed the Soulsword. Nightcrawler currently keeps the Soulsword inside his body.

Because of Margali's indiscriminate use of magic, she and Amanda parted ways on tense terms.<ref>''Nightcrawler'' (2014) #2-#4.</ref> Following Nightcrawler's resurrection<ref>''Amazing X-Men'' (vol.2) #1-5.</ref> and his reunion with Amanda, Margali began to lust for the secrets of the afterlife. For this purpose, she engineered an attack by a quasi-robotic villain of her own creation called Trimega, pushing Nightcrawler into granting her sanctuary at the [[X-Mansion|Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]].<ref>''Nightcrawler'' (2014) #1-#2.</ref> Once there, she attacked [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], who had participated in Nightcrawler's recovery, converting their bodies into pictures of their memories. Stealing those memories relating to their experiences in the afterlife, she opened a portal into the Beyond. Intent on closing it from the other side, Nightcrawler and Amanda attempted to pass the gate, but Nightcrawler's voluntary exile from Heaven barred him from entry, stranding Amanda alone in the Void.<ref>''Nightcrawler'' (2014) #4.</ref>

Margali is an accomplished sorceress, equal of almost any sorcerer on Earth, occupying "The Winding Way's" highest position. The Winding Way grants mystic power, but that power ebbs and flows unpredictably, affecting the strength of Margali's magic. Margali can cast spells and transform herself. As the Red Queen she manifested her magic as a flaming sword, could extend her nails into long talons, and fire blasts of red arcane energy. Upon her first meeting of [[Doctor Strange]], she summoned his [[Eye of Agamotto]] away from him against his will, a feat which made him consider that her powers could rival or dwarf his own.

===Margali Szardos in other media===
Margali appears in the ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' episode "The Toad, the Witch and the Wardrobe". Along with her daughter, Amanda, her history and background from the comics is not represented, and is instead portrayed as a normal Gypsy woman. She is voiced by [[Teryl Rothery]].

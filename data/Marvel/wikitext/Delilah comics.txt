[[Spider-Man]] is a [[superhero]] created by [[Marvel Comics]] who debuted in the [[anthology]] comic book series issue ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15 (August [[1962 in comics|1962]]) during the [[Silver Age of Comics]]. After his debut, he got his own comic book entitled ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]''. This comic introduced many of what would become his major [[supervillain]] adversaries. Spider-Man then became popular enough for more Spider-Man comic spinoffs (''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', ''[[Web of Spider-Man]]'', ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man]]'' etc.) which introduced more recurring enemies of the web-slinger, across [[List of incarnations of Spider-Man|their various incarnations]].

As with Spider-Man, most of his villains' powers originate from scientific accidents or the misuse of scientific technology. They can be classified into multiple categories, such as animal-themed villains ([[Doctor Octopus]], [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]], [[Rhino (character)|Rhino]], [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]], [[Jackal (Marvel Comics character)|Jackal]], [[Beetle (comics)|Beetle]], [[Kangaroo (comics)|Kangaroo]], [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)|Tarantula]], and [[Puma (comics)|Puma]]), those with powers over the elements ([[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Molten Man]], and [[Hydro-Man]]), horror-themed villains (the [[Green Goblin]], the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]], [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Morbius]], [[Morlun (comics)|Morlun]], and the [[symbiote (comics)|Symbiotes]]), crime lords (the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]], [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]], [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]], [[Silvermane]], and [[Mister Negative]]),<ref name="Top25"/> inventors (the [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], the [[Tinkerer (Marvel Comics)|Tinkerer]], [[Spencer Smythe]], and [[Alistair Smythe]]), and masters of trickery and illusion (the [[Chameleon (Marvel Comics)|Chameleon]] and [[Mysterio]]).<ref name="Top25">{{cite web | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/16/top-25-spider-man-villains| title=Top 25 Spider-Man Villains| publisher=IGN | date=16 April 2014 | access-date=18 June 2015}}</ref> There are, however, numerous villains that don't fit into any specific category, such as [[Kraven the Hunter]] and [[Mephisto (Marvel Comics)|Mephisto]], the latter of whom originated as a [[Silver Surfer]] villain. The villains oftentimes form teams such as the [[Sinister Six]] to oppose the web-slinger.

Spider-Man is notable for having numerous villains that redeemed themselves and became [[antihero]]es, such as [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], the [[Prowler (Marvel Comics)|Prowler]], [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Morbius]], [[Kraven the Hunter|Kraven]], and [[Silver Sable]]. Also, unlike most superheroes, Spider-Man doesn't have one particular [[archenemy]], but rather three: the [[Norman Osborn]] version of the Green Goblin, [[Doctor Octopus]], and the [[Eddie Brock]] version of [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]], the latter two of whom have been similarly redeemed and depicted as antiheroes.

The rogues gallery of Spider-Man has garnered positive critical acclaim and has been considered one of the greatest rogues galleries of all time.

==Debuting in Spider-Man titles==
[[File:Stan Lee by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Stan Lee is responsible with helping create the most villains for the web-slinger and helped pave the way for the fictional rogues gallery.]]
The majority of supervillains depicted in Spider-Man comics first appeared in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'', while some first appeared in spinoff comics such as ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' and ''Marvel Team-Up'' and other titles.

===''The Amazing Spider-Man'' debuts===
{{see also|List of The Amazing Spider-Man issues}}
Most of the supervillains of Spider-Man would be introduced in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' comic book starting with the Chameleon.<ref name="DeFalco87"/> The early villains would be introduced in the [[1960s in comics|1960s]] during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]],<ref name="DeFalco87"/> and created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko.<ref name="DeFalco87"/> John Romita Sr. replaced Ditko starting with the Rhino.<ref name="Kindersly 6"/> Gerry Conway later replaced Stan Lee and helped create new adversaries for the web-slinger and also helped pave the way for the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books]] with the death of Spider-Man's long time romantic interest, Gwen Stacy.<ref>Manning "1970s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 62: "[''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #111] marked the dawning of a new era: writer Gerry Conway came on board as Stan Lee's replacement. Alongside artist john Romita, Conway started his run by picking up where Lee left off."</ref><ref>Manning "1970s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 68: "This story by writer Gerry Conway and penciler Gil Kane would go down in history as one of the most memorable events of Spider-Man's life."</ref><ref>David and Greenberger p. 49: "The idea of beloved supporting characters meeting their deaths may be standard operating procedure now but in 1973 it was unprecedented...stan's death took villainy and victimhood to an entirely new level."</ref> Many collaborators would soon take over ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' title. One of the more popular examples included Todd McFarlane's Venom in the [[Modern Age of Comic Books]].<ref name="Venom2"/>

Killing several people and blaming Norman for his condition, van Adder harasses and later attempts to kill him before being knocked out an Oscorp window by Chief of Security Arthur Stacy and his brother Detective [[George Stacy]]. In order to escape conviction for what he had done to van Adder, Norman convinces the police that van Adder had been experimenting on himself and that he had been trying to help him. Van Adder was last seen fleeing into the wilderness and his current fate is unknown.

As well as endowing van Adder with super strength and agility, the prototypical Goblin Formula gave him claws, talons, fangs, glowing green eyes, and near-impenetrable red skin that is capable of withstanding several close range bullet shots.

'''Delilah''' first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #414 by [[Tom DeFalco]] and [[Mark Bagley]].<ref name="confidential"/> A highly skilled and ruthless assassin who came under the employ of the Rose during one of the many crime-boss gang wars and became his confidante as well as his chief enforcer. She is first shown wiping out an entire room of mobsters so the Rose could maintain control of part of the New York Organize Crime. Delilah came into conflict with Spider-Man for the first time when she attempted to assassinate the ex-husband of one of Rose's employers. When the [[Black Tarantula]] first involved himself in the gang war, Delilah attempted to kill his super-strong henchman El Uno but she was overwhelmed by his power. The rematch, though, was a firm win for Delilah, with El Uno's head being mailed back to the Black Tarantula.<ref>{{Cite comic

She also had a role during the Rose's efforts to gain extra muscle and to remove Spider-Man from interfering in their operations, in the rebirth of two of Spider-Man's old foes. She was the one who threw the switch of the [[electric chair]] which gave [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] his powers back, hoping he would eliminate Spider-Man. Electro failed, and so they devised a new plan. This time, they stole the corpse of [[Doctor Octopus]] so [[The Hand (comics)|the Hand]] could succeed in restoring him to life. Delilah later found herself ambushed by the Black Tarantula himself, who easily subdued her and broke her neck, inflicting fatal injuries, but before she could die, however, the Black Tarantula instantly healed her with a message of warning for the Rose.

Attempting to find help to bring down the Black Tarantula, Delilah enlisted the aid of the new costumed adventurer Ricochet (actually Spider-Man in disguise). Together they tackled two of the Black Tarantula's operatives, Roughhouse and Bloodscream. Bloodscream grabbed hold of Delilah and caused her to bleed until she passed out. She was taken by the authorities to the hospital.

Years later she appears in [[Loners (comics)|Loners]] as an assassin smuggling MGH. When Johnny Gallo (the second Ricochet) broke into a laboratory, she thought he was the one she had teamed up with, and attacked him. Despite her skills, Johnny managed to knock her out with a cunningly thrown disc.<ref>Loners #5 Comic – September 12, 2007</ref><ref>{{Cite comic

==Antiheroes and reformed, semi-reformed, or occasionally reformed supervillains==
The following is a list of Spider-Man adversaries who, at one point or another, have been reformed or semi-reformed, either temporarily or currently, or who are no longer primarily antagonists of Spider-Man. Many of these characters are now anti-heroes and have often acted as allies of the web-slinger, while others occasionally return to villain status depending on the story arc.

They opined that the scope of their schemes, how cool their powers are, and how dramatically they have affected Spider-Man's life is what makes the Spider-Man villains so great.<ref name="Top25"/> ''[[Newsarama]]'' ranked Spider-Man's rogues gallery as number one out of ten as the greatest rogues gallery of all time.<ref name="rogues gallery">{{cite web|last1=George|first1=Marston|title=The 10 Greatest ROGUES GALLERIES of ALL TIME!|url=http://www.newsarama.com/15497-the-10-greatest-rogues-galleries-of-all-time.html|website=Newsarama|access-date=18 June 2015|date=7 August 2013}}</ref>

===Themes===
George Marston of ''[[Newsarama]]'' said that the reason he felt that Spider-Man's rogues gallery was the best was the thematic elements that the villains manifested.<ref name="rogues gallery"/> He explained that just like the superhero they have the same concept of science gone wrong. They are "like him, great men with great minds, great power, and great determination." But instead they fail to use their powers responsibly, symbolizing the thin line between being a hero and being a villain.<ref name="rogues gallery"/> Alex Wyse of ''[[Comic Book Resources]]'' felt that a good villain is supposed to challenge the ideals of the hero. For Spider-Man that idea was the famous quote "[[With great power comes great responsibility]]", where the superhero is pitted against an antithesis of the hero's motto like the concept of using [[Superpower (ability)|superpower]]s for their personal gain.<ref name="CBR slayer">{{cite web |title=Spider-Slayers: The 25 Deadliest Spider-Man Villains, Officially Ranked |url=https://www.cbr.com/spider-man-villains-ranked |website=CBR |access-date=15 August 2019 |date=16 January 2019}}</ref>

==Me and the Boys==
A viral [[internet meme]] called "Me and the Boys", centering on images of Spider-Man foes from the 1960s ''[[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series that showcases the four supervillains – the [[Green Goblin]], [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] and a photoshopped addition of [[Rhino (character)|Rhino]] – along with other Spider-Man foes in some variations, emerged in 2019.

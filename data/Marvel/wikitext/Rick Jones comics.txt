==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=March 2015}}
Rick Jones was created in 1962 by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] and first appeared in ''[[Hulk]]'' #1 (May 1962).<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=200}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Rick Jones was born in Scarsdale, Arizona. He lost his parents at a young age and grew up in an orphanage. Later, he accepts a dare to drive out to a [[bomb]] [[Nuclear weapons testing|testing ground]] in [[New Mexico]]. As luck would have it, the [[Radiological weapon|gamma bomb]] designed by Dr. Robert Bruce Banner is being tested. Banner pushes Rick into a protective trench saving his life, but absorbing the [[gamma ray]]s that transform Banner into the [[Hulk]]. Rick thus becomes the sole confidant of the Hulk's true identity.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== Early days with the Hulk and the Avengers ===
Jones' guilt over causing the incident (and lack of any other place to go) leads him to stay close to Dr. Banner and the Hulk alter ego. In one story, he even gains mental control over Hulk. Eventually, the dangerous unpredictability of Hulk forces Rick to keep his distance.

Later, Rick forms the [[Teen Brigade]], a loose network of teenagers with [[amateur radio|ham radios]] throughout the United States. The first Teen Brigade played a role in the origin of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] when the Norse god [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] tampered with the Teen Brigade's radio transmission. Originally, the Teen Brigade intended to bring the [[Fantastic Four]] together to battle the Hulk, but instead brought [[Iron Man]], [[Hank Pym|Ant-Man]], [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] together to form the Avengers.<ref>''The Avengers'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After the Hulk's departure from the team, Rick becomes an honorary Avenger. He alerted the team to the Hulk's presence when they began searching for Hulk.<ref>''The Avengers'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''The Avengers'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> He becomes close to the recently revived [[Captain America]] although his guilt leads him to leave the Avengers and seek out Banner and Hulk on his own.<ref>''The Avengers'' #17; ''Tales to Astonish'' #69. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Captain America rescues Rick from one of Hulk's rampages, and after that Rick becomes Captain America's sidekick, briefly taking the title and uniform of [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|Bucky]], Captain America's [[Bucky Barnes|long-dead junior partner]]. This was on Jones' own insistence, but Captain America continues to have guilty objections, noting that others have lost partners and it was time to move on. Rick's brief time as Bucky gave him the training to survive around superheroes to this day.<ref>''Captain America'' #110–116. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Rick believed Hulk to be dead (although Hulk had actually been sent to the future), he revealed the truth of Banner's condition to [[Glenn Talbot|Col. Glenn Talbot]], thus inadvertently making Banner a wanted fugitive by the US Military.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #77. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Wells |first1=John |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1965-1969 |date=2014 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490557 |page=92}}</ref>

===Captain Mar-Vell===
After being neglected by Captain America, Rick became fed up with the Captain's ego. After talking with [[Edwin Jarvis]], Rick decided to leave the Avengers for good. Rick joined with the [[Kree]] [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]] when he finds himself drawn to the mystical [[Nega-Bands]]. Donning the Bands, he is immediately linked to Captain Marvel. Once joined, one of the two remains in a protective bubble in the [[Negative Zone]]. After either the person not in the Negative Zone strikes the Nega-Bands together or a certain amount of time passes, the two switch places.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #17. Marvel Comics.</ref> Rick and Mar-Vell go on various adventures encountering many different heroes, such as the Hulk,<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #20-21. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Namor]],<ref>''Sub-Mariner'' #30. Marvel Comics.</ref> and Captain America.<ref>''The Avengers'' #72. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Rick and Mar-Vell play a critical part in the [[Kree-Skrull War]]. Rick is freed from the Negative Zone through a portal in the Fantastic Four headquarters. Mar-Vell is released from the Negative Zone while Rick is still in the regular world without the use of the Nega-Bands. The bond between the two is broken. At the height of the conflict, the Kree [[Supreme Intelligence]] briefly unleashes the Destiny Force from within Rick. Rick uses his new-found ability to summon images of various [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] heroes. While at full power, Rick single-handedly stops both the [[Kree]] and [[Skrull]] fleets long enough to put an end to the conflict. Injuries that Rick sustains lead Mar-Vell to willingly bond with Rick in order to save his life.<ref>''The Avengers'' #89–97. Marvel Comics.</ref> Shortly after this the Captain Marvel series was re-launched and we found that Rick was not able to contain the energy of Mar-Vell. He was then bombarded with photonic energy, which saved him and enabled him to contain Mar-Vell safely. A consequence of this was that Mar-Vell gained the ability to absorb energy in addition to the nega-band energies to boost his strength and could fly with the photonic energy now.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #22 (Sept. 1972). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Rick and Mar-Vell serve as a duo for several years while Rick pursues his musical career and love life. Eventually, the two are again freed from their bond while aiding the Avengers against the [[Super-Adaptoid]]. Rick then parts company with Mar-Vell.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #50–51. Marvel Comics.</ref> Rick begins to spend his time with the Hulk again and briefly forms a new Teen Brigade,<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #251-253, 260, 262, 264, 265 Marvel Comics.</ref> after which Rick finds himself again teamed with Mar-Vell,<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #245 Marvel Comics.</ref> though not merged with him as they deal with a legacy left by the Mad Titan [[Thanos]]. Sometime after, Mar-Vell dies of cancer that he received when he was exposed to a deadly nerve gas stolen by the villain [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]].<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #34. Marvel Comics.</ref> Note: Mar-Vell collapsed from the gas and was comatose until he was given an antidote to the gas. However, despite the antidote, Mar-Vell still developed cancer and there was some momentary concern that the link Rick shared with him could have caused himself to contract the condition. Rick was at Mar-Vell's bedside when he died.<ref>''Marvel Graphic Novel'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Venturing with Rom===
After Mar-Vell's death, Rick began to team with the Hulk again.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #267 Marvel Comics.</ref> Guilt over causing Banner to be hit with the gamma rays made Rick decide to expose himself to gamma rays in an attempt to become another Hulk-like being that could stop the Hulk.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #269-270 Marvel Comics.</ref> However this plan backfired and Rick was dying of gamma poisoning until Banner cured him.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #275-276 Marvel Comics.</ref> However, this too led to the consequence of Rick developing a form of [[Hematological malignancy|blood cancer]].<ref>''Rom'' #56. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Rick was going to undergo a massive blood transfusion to treat this ailment when the hospital was attacked by monsters created by the [[Dire Wraith]]s. Rick was saved by the Spaceknight [[Rom (comics)|Rom]] and began to team with Rom despite the fact that Rick was slowly dying.<ref>''Rom'' #57. Marvel Comics.</ref> Upon the final defeat of the Wraiths, Rom banished them all to Limbo and then bade farewell to Rick Jones and Earth.<ref>''Rom'' #70. Marvel Comics.</ref> Shortly after Rom left, Rick Jones met the alien called The [[Beyonder]], who cured Jones of his cancer.<ref>''Rom'' #72. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Reunion with the Hulk===
Shortly after the encounter with the Beyonder, Rick once again teamed with the Hulk.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #319 Marvel Comics.</ref> This time, the Hulk had been split into two beings, Banner and Hulk,<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2  #315 Marvel Comics.</ref> but the experiment was a failure and both were dying.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #320-323 Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Thunderbolt Ross|General Ross]] tried to stop the process of remerging the two, and Rick intervened only to be dumped into the chemical nutrient bath that was fusing Banner and the Hulk again.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #324 Marvel Comics.</ref> This resulted in Rick somehow becoming a Hulk-like creature of his own and he took off into the desert on a savage rampage.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #325 Marvel Comics.</ref> Rick would be human by day and be his own green-skinned near mindless Hulk at night.

With the [[Vision (Marvel comics)|Vision]]'s help, Banner and the Hulk are made whole again, but, both are weak and still dying. As a result of a Nutrient Bath developed by [[Doc Samson]], Banner/Hulk is reverted from Green Hulk into the [[Hulk#Grey Hulk ("Joe Fixit")|Grey Hulk]]. During this time, Rick as Hulk battled the Grey Hulk, [[Zzzax]], the [[Hulkbusters]], and the Outcasts. The Grey Hulk is manipulated by Sam Sterns, along with Banner, into siphoning the radiation from Rick into Sterns. Sterns is then turned back into the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]], drastically altering his appearance, and Rick is cured of his Hulk transformations.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #324–329, 332. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Rick stays with Banner, the Grey Hulk, [[Betty Ross|Betty Banner]], and [[Clay Quartermain]] for several months as they travel the country looking for a government supply of [[Radiological weapon|gamma bombs]]. The group splits after the Hulk's apparent death at the Leader's hands.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #341-346 Marvel Comics.</ref> Rick's psionic potential is later released by [[Moondragon]] against [[Homo mermanus|Atlantean]] invaders.<ref>''The Avengers'' Annual #18. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Rick authors the book "Sidekick", an autobiography of his time with super-heroes. While on a book tour, he meets [[Marlo Chandler]] without realizing that she had only recently broken up with the Hulk (then acting as a [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] thug with the alias Mr. Fixit). Rick is kidnapped by a Skrull vessel and the Hulk aids in Rick's rescue.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #374–376. Marvel Comics.</ref> This starts another period with Rick and the Hulk, this time with Marlo and Betty.

===Encounters with death===
Rick came in touch with [[death]] in several ways during this time with the Hulk. First, Rick dies at the hands of Thanos, along with half of the universe, when Thanos uses the [[The Infinity Gauntlet|Infinity Gauntlet]] to impress [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]].<ref>''The Infinity Gauntlet'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Rick and the others are brought back in ensuing events.<ref>''The Infinity Gauntlet'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> Rick remembers meeting several deceased rock stars.

Rick assisted the Hulk many times during his tenure with the [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]].<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #386–390. Marvel Comics.</ref> During this time, he guns down an insane killer, but is still wracked with remorse. Over time he bonds with [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] of X-Factor, who also killed another insane murderer during the same debacle;<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #392. Marvel Comics.</ref> he even ends up inviting her to his wedding.<ref name=autogenerated5>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #418. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Another major encounter with death occurs when Jackie Shorr (who is revealed to be a demented [[serial killer]]) comes into his life and claims to be his mother.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #396. Marvel Comics.</ref> This claim has not been proven, but she insists that those she killed and left mummified in her basement were substitutes for Rick, and that he is her real son. Shorr is discovered to be insane, but not until after she kills Marlo by stabbing her with a kitchen knife.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #398. Marvel Comics.</ref> A horrified Rick refuses [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]]'s offer to carry out a DNA test, saying that he does not want to know, especially if she is truly his mother.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #399. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Rick attempts to bring Marlo back using a [[resurrection]] device known as the "[[deus ex machina]]" that the Leader developed, but the Hulk, believing that the Leader's efforts are part of a bigger villainous plan, destroys the equipment part way through the process.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #400. Marvel Comics.</ref> Marlo is left in a [[Catatonia|catatonic]] state.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #401. Marvel Comics.</ref> Rick's care eventually helps Marlo return to full health despite the intervention of many other well-meaning friends and family, including Marlo's brothers and Captain America.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #406. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Shortly after Marlo is revived, the two become engaged and quickly marry.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #409. Marvel Comics.</ref> Neither of them realizes, however, that a portion of Death remains ''in'' Marlo. This piece of Death attracted many strange visitors to the wedding, including [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] and [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] herself.<ref name=autogenerated5/>

The married couple soon finds success in a popular talk show, ''Keeping Up with the Joneses'',<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #439. Marvel Comics.</ref> but it is cut short when Rick is crippled by a Banner-less Hulk,<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #457. Marvel Comics.</ref> that made a deal to work for [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] and become his [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Horseman]] "War" if he would remove the shrapnel from the Hulk's brain.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #456. Marvel Comics.</ref> The injury confines Rick to a wheelchair and the debilitation strains his relationship with Marlo.<ref name=autogenerated6>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #467. Marvel Comics.</ref> The strain increases with the death of Betty Banner by [[radiation poisoning]] to the point that the couple split shortly thereafter.<ref name=autogenerated6/>

Rick joins Dr. Banner again after he returns to Earth and merges with the separated Hulk.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #468. Marvel Comics.</ref> His serious health problems force him to be brought by the Avengers to the now-captive [[Supreme Intelligence]] for aid, which marks the beginning of the [[Avengers Forever|Destiny War]], as Kang the Conqueror's rejection of his apparent destiny to become Immortus results in Rick's access to the mysterious 'Destiny Force' being used to draw in a team of seven Avengers from different points in time to act as his protectors. Over the course of these events, Rick's injury is healed when he is able to channel the Destiny Force into himself,<ref>''Avengers Forever'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> and after the final battle with the powerful Time Keepers,<ref>''Avengers Forever'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> he is joined with [[Genis-Vell]] (the recently endowed Captain Marvel and son of Mar-Vell), due to a temporal paradox involving the future Genis-Vell linking with Rick to save his life.<ref>''Avengers Forever'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Captain Marvel (Genis-Vell)===
Rick's bond with Genis works in about the same way as his bond with Mar-Vell. The biggest difference is that the two switch in and out of the [[Microverse]] rather than the [[Negative Zone]]. Genis-Vell's unique birth and accelerated aging makes him the opposite of Rick: full of power but without experience. They compensate for each other's weaknesses with Rick taking on the role of mentor. He helped Genis learn to control his [[Omniscience|Cosmic Awareness]] and accept his role as a [[superhero]]. As Rick's confidence grew, he also attempted to rekindle his romance with Marlo.

It was not until this point that Marlo's connection with Death is finally revealed. Thanos aids in separating the two, but Rick is prematurely aged and loses an arm in the process. He is later yanked back in time to the Destiny War, where he aids his younger self in the conflict leading to his bond with Genis.

Marlo tries to aid the elderly Rick the way he had helped her when she was catatonic. Rick's pride, however, just causes more problems. The [[Supreme Intelligence]] attempts and fails to restore Rick to his normal condition, but he is spontaneously restored to his normal age and health shortly thereafter. Rick believes this was [[divinity|divine]] aid while Genis believes it was a delayed reaction to the Supreme Intelligence's procedure. No definitive explanation has yet been determined.

For a while, Rick and Genis are yanked back and forth through time. Rick encounters two older versions of himself: one an aging collector surviving under the rule of the [[Maestro (comics)|Maestro]]; the other a super-villain named [[#Thanatos|Thanatos]]. The super-villain Rick was in the process of creating the "ultimate Rick Jones". He is stopped by the elder Rick's ability to wield [[Mjolnir (comics)|Thor's hammer]], Rick having been judged worthy for things the present Rick had yet to do and things that Thanatos would never achieve.

Rick and Marlo again split when Marlo becomes romantically involved with [[Moondragon]]. Shortly after, Genis goes insane when his cosmic awareness reaches its peak. Rick's attempts to continue as Genis' guide are fairly unsuccessful. Genis becomes a callous, homicidal maniac believing himself a god. Rick's friend even destroys the universe just to rebuild it with Rick and Genis as sole survivors.

In the rebuilt reality, Genis again loses his mind. Rick develops an ability to mentally attack Genis through their psychic bond (although the pain is reciprocal). For a time, Genis uses this same link to control Rick. He goes as far as 'convincing' Rick to kill himself on a whim. Genis brings Rick right back to life just as easily.

In part due to Rick's influence, Genis' madness calmed to a point where he was able to maintain a veneer of sanity, albeit with some unpredictability. He creates a recording studio for Rick that allows for fame and fortune at the sake of Internet-based sales of a song written for Marlo. The same song also acts as a catalyst for the two to reunite, with Marlo ending her relationship with Moondragon.

At the end of the series, it is revealed that Rick has a "[[fourth wall|comic awareness]]" that the ''Captain Marvel'' comic series was coming to an end. He pushed for several of the loose ends of the series to be resolved: Rick and Genis were separated again, and Rick was reunited with Marlo at last report. This ability was primarily created for the needs of this one issue, and it seems unlikely that it will see future usage.

===''Runaways''===
Rick was revealed to be the mysterious benefactor of [[Loners (comics)|Excelsior]].<ref name="Runaways Vol 4.: True Believers">{{cite book|last1=Vaughan|first1=Brian K.|title=Runaways Vol 4.: True Believers|date=2008|publisher=Panini|location=Tunbridge Wells|isbn=978-1-905239-83-2}}</ref> The group is composed of former teenage superheroes dedicated to reforming other super-powered kids from following down the same path. Their first targets are the underage [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]] patrolling Los Angeles in the wake of the supervillain power vacuum since the defeat of the Runaways' evil parents, [[Pride (comics)|The Pride]], who once controlled the city.<ref name="Runaways Vol 4.: True Believers" /> Rick tells Excelsior that he wanted the Runaways back in foster care because he did not want them to go through the same experiences he went through.<ref name="Runaways Vol 4.: True Believers" />

===Fallen Son: Death of Captain America===
Rick served as one of the pallbearers at the memorial service for Captain America, along with Ben Grimm, Ms. Marvel, The Falcon, T'Challa and Tony Stark. When [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson (The Falcon)]] made his inspirational speech, he mentioned that Rick would know what it's like to have called Captain America a partner. Jones replied by saying "Right on."<ref>''Fallen Son (Iron Man)'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''World War Hulk''===
Rick re-connects with the Hulk during the ''[[World War Hulk]]'' mini-series. He seeks out the Hulk and attempts to talk him down, telling his friend that, while he recognized that the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] had been out of line in their decision to exile him to Sakaar and their apparent involvement with the deaths of thousands of innocent people on that planet, including the Hulk's wife and unborn child, his current blind quest for vengeance was not him, using Hulk's willingness to protect innocent people caught in the fight between him and a [[Zom]]-possessed [[Doctor Strange]] as proof that the Hulk was still a hero rather than a man blindly seeking vengeance. After the Hulk's climactic battle with the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] resulted in him reverting to Bruce Banner, one of the Hulk's associates, [[Miek]] (who witnesses and did not prevent the true cause of the deaths on Sakaar which was not the humans), impales Rick through the chest to provoke Bruce into turning back into the Hulk. Rick is seen being loaded into an ambulance.<ref>''[[World War Hulk]]'' #1–5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Becoming A-Bomb===
[[File:Abomb.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Rick Jones as A-Bomb, from ''Hulk'' (vol. 2) #2 (April 2008). Art by [[Ed McGuinness]].]]
In the aftermath of "[[World War Hulk]]", a new [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]] emerged,<ref name="hulk1">Loeb, Jeph. ''Hulk'' vol. 2 #1 (March 2008). Marvel Comics.</ref> brutally beating and then shooting the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]] to death.{{issue|date=June 2012}} After this occurred, Jones escaped from a secret base in Alaska that had been destroyed in a "Hulk-like" manner.{{issue|date=June 2012}} Following this, Red Hulk confronts Jones at Gamma Base, where Bruce Banner is being held. In defense, Jones inexplicably transforms into a creature resembling the Abomination, calling himself A-Bomb.<ref name="HULK2">[[Loeb, Jeph]]. ''Hulk'' vol. 2 #2 (April 2008). Marvel Comics.</ref> During the fight, the base security measures activate, and giant [[android (robot)|android]] [[harpy|harpies]] (with the face of [[Betty Ross]]) attack the two, and attempt to remove them from the base. A-Bomb manages to disable one mid-flight, and they both crash to earth, the robot exploding as it does.<ref name="HULK3">'' Hulk'' vol. 2 #3 (May 2008). Marvel Comics.</ref>

A-Bomb joined with several heroes including the Avengers, the Fantastic Four, She-Hulk and the Hulk to help stop an impending earthquake in San Francisco, which was caused by Red Hulk.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2 #5 (Aug. 2008). Marvel Comics.</ref> After the Red Hulk was defeated, A-Bomb reverted to Rick. He attempted to reveal who Red Hulk really was, but was shot and dragged away by [[Doc Samson]].<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2 #6 (Sept. 2008). Marvel Comics.</ref> In ''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #600 it is revealed the reason Doc Samson shot Rick Jones is because he now has [[multiple personality syndrome]]. It's also revealed that [[MODOK]] was involved in Rick's new condition. After Red Hulk drained the gamma energy from Hulk, A-Bomb had enough intelligence to get Bruce Banner to safety.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #600. Marvel Comics.</ref> In ''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #604, A-Bomb was shown to be fully healed, participating along with [[Korg (comics)|Korg]] as [[Skaar (character)|Skaar]]'s sparring partner to prepare him for the time when the Hulk will return. In the same issue, Rick was reunited with Marlo, who was transformed by the Leader into [[Marlo Chandler|Harpy]], whom Bruce mistakes for Betty Ross.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #604. Marvel Comics.</ref>

It was eventually revealed that Rick was transformed into A-Bomb by the Intelligencia under command of the Leader and MODOK. Using the Abomination's blood they changed him to become their weapon, but soon learned that he could not be controlled as easily as they planned. Instead, they gave him one simple command with a certain trigger—kill Bruce Banner. Suspecting this, Bruce was able to trigger Rick at an earlier time of his choosing and talk him down, thus preventing Rick from being triggered in the future when his plans were to be carried out.{{Issue|date=September 2010}}

During the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, A-Bomb and Korg assist the Hulks in fighting [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], a [[Zom]]-possessed [[Doctor Strange]], and the forces of [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]].<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #618. Marvel Comics.</ref> It is later revealed that Rick is able to change between A-Bomb and his normal form.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #635. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When a new Hulk persona emerges as the result of an attempt to assassinate Bruce Banner and efforts to save his life using the [[Extremis#The Extremis virus|Extremis virus]], this new Hulk, calling himself "Doc Green", decides that gamma-powered superhumans are a threat to humanity that must be eliminated. Deriving a cure for others' gamma mutations from his own physiology, Green seeks out Rick as his first target. Though Rick resists transforming into A-Bomb to defend himself, Green is apparently successful in permanently reverting Rick to human form.<ref name=autogenerated8>''Hulk'' vol. 3 #6 (Sept. 2014). Marvel Comics.</ref> Afterward, Rick seeks out Betty (who had been revived from death by Intelligencia and transformed into the [[Betty Ross#Red She-Hulk|Red She-Hulk]] the same way Rick was transformed into A-Bomb), ostensibly in order to warn her about Doc Green's intentions.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 3 #7 (Oct. 2014). Marvel Comics.</ref> When Green arrives and Betty assaults him as the Red She-Hulk, she finds herself reverting to normal involuntarily and realizes that Rick had dosed her with Green's cure during a meal they had shared earlier. Rick admits to anxieties over the possibility of losing control of his transformation, and an addiction to the "rush" of being A-Bomb. However, he was unwilling to aid Doc Green in curing Betty until Doc Green informed him that Betty, acting under orders from a watchdog group called The Order of the Shield, was behind the attempt on Banner's life. Rick is left behind with the equally powerless Betty as Doc Green continues on his mission.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 3 #8 (Nov. 2014). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Working as Whisperer===
As a side effect of losing his Hulk abilities, Rick briefly gains the ability to learn any task at lightning speed. He uses this ability to become a master hacktivist known as the Whisperer during the "[[Avengers: Standoff!]]" storyline and secretly aids the new [[Falcon (comics)|Captain America]]. He uncovers a plot by [[Maria Hill]] called Project [[List of Marvel Comics characters: K#Kobik|Kobik]], which uses shattered [[Cosmic Cube]] remains to create a new cube.<ref>''Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Alpha'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Phil Coulson]]'s group learns about Pleasant Hill and Rick's involvement. Deathlok, Daisy Johnson, and [[Jemma Simmons]] investigated Rick' house and discovered a hidden escape route. They follow Rick through the Morlock Tunnels and apprehend him. During an interrogation at the S.H.I.E.L.D. Battlecarrier, the New Avengers arrived to retrieve Jones from S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> It turns out that the New Avengers were contacted by Rick through a pre-recorded video that was to be sent to them in the event that the alien nanobots he ingested noticed him being unconscious. The New Avengers invading the S.H.I.E.L.D.

During the "[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]" storyline, a hacker named Rashaun Lucas is entrusted with key data by Rick Jones that Jones says will prove the truth about Captain America, who at the time was reprogrammed by [[Red Skull]]'s clone using the powers of Kobik into being a Hydra sleeper agent. Captain America later sentences a captive Rick Jones to death by firing squad.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Revival as Subject B===
After his death, Rick Jones was buried at Severin Memorial Cemetery. The Immortal Hulk takes Doc Samson there in order to prove that he, Bruce Banner, Betty Ross, and Rick Jones are all connected to one constant theme: resurrection. They find Rick Jones' grave dug up and his body missing.<ref>''The Immortal Hulk'' #15. Marvel Comics.</ref> In the U.S. Hulk Operations' Shadow Base Site B, Rick Jones' corpse is used for gamma experiments by scientists led by Charlene McGowan and his whole body is covered in gamma energy, which resurrects him as an Abomination/A-Bomb-like creature with two faces and many finger-like structures surrounding his face called Subject B.<ref>''The Immortal Hulk'' #16-17. Marvel Comics.</ref> Using a camera placed inside Rick's head, the U.S. Hulk Operations dispatched Subject B to Reno, Nevada to draw out Hulk. After Subject B killed two bystanders, Hulk appeared to fight it thinking that it was a form of Abomination. He discovered that it was actually Rick as his two faces spoke short and tortured sentences.<ref>''The Immortal Hulk'' #18. Marvel Comics.</ref> Hulk had no other choice but to fight Rick's Subject B form. During the fight, Subject B shot acid at Hulk that dissolved part of his flesh and negated his ability to heal. Upon melting Hulk's limbs, Betty Ross' Harpy form appeared and ripped open Hulk in order to consume his heart.<ref name="Immortal Hulk #19">''The Immortal Hulk'' #19. Marvel Comics.</ref> This caused Rick Jones' Subject B to attack Betty Ross' Harpy. Hulk revives enough to regenerate his limbs and punch Subject B. Harpy then continues her attack on Subject B and rips at his stomach to prevent him from emitting acid. During the fight between Subject B and Harpy, Hulk got Jackie McGee to safety as two War-Wagons sent by Reginald Fortean arrive. When in the air, Harpy dropped Subject B onto one of the War-Wagons. After destroying the War-Wagons, Hulk ripped open Subject B's body to discover that it was a shell containing an emaciated Rick in his human form. With Rick in tow, Hulk, Harpy, and Jackie fled the area upon Hulk seeing Gamma Flight approaching.<ref>''The Immortal Hulk'' #20. Marvel Comics.</ref> Some days later, Rick was still emaciated and speaking broken words until a burst of energy awakens and restores him. Using what he had learned while being experimented on, Rick directed Hulk, Harpy, and Jackie McGee toward the U.S. Hulk Operations' base at Groom Lake in Area 51.<ref>''The Immortal Hulk'' #21. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Doc Samson and Gamma Flight confronted General Fortean at the U.S. Hulk Operations' base, Hulk, Rick, Harpy, and Jackie also show up as both sides see that General Fortean has merged with the Subject B body.<ref>''The Immortal Hulk'' #22. Marvel Comics.</ref> While Hulk and Gamma Flight fight General Fortean and the U.S. Hulk Operations' soldiers, Rick assisted Harpy and Jackie McGee where they found the gamma mutate Delbert Frye in a room with scientist and Charlene McGowan who tearfully accepted responsibility for what happened to Rick and Delbert. This caused Rick to spare her life.<ref>''The Immortal Hulk'' #23. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Soon after, however, it is revealed that Rick's body is in fact a puppet controlled by [[Leader (comics)|The Leader]].<ref>''The Immortal Hulk'' #33. Marvel Comics.</ref> During Hulk's photo op following the repairs of Georgeville, Iowa which was wrecked during Hulk's fight with the Avengers, Leader controlled Rick Jones into overflowing Hulk with gamma energy to kill him which caused an explosion.<ref>''The Immortal Hulk'' #35. Marvel Comics.</ref> Rick protected the people from the explosion, but was mutated into an elongated form with extra arms and legs in the process. Using Rick, Leader watched Hulk's fight with Gamma Flight. When Titania noticed that Rick made an unintelligent comment, Leader controlled Rick into knocking her down causing Absorbing Man to fight Hulk some more. Then Leader allows Rick to be teleported to Shadow Base just as he planned.<ref>''The Immortal Hulk'' #36. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Rick Jones is an athletic man who previously had no powers. He received special training in combat and gymnastics by Captain America, making him a highly skilled martial artist. Rick is also a self-taught folk/[[Rock and roll|rock 'n' roll]] singer, guitarist, and harmonica player.

One time, Rick wielded the Destiny Force: a powerful ability utilized during a Kree-Skrull War storyline.<ref>''Avengers: Forever'' Vol #1 (December 1998)</ref> With this power through focus, he were able to perform amazing feats, such as pulling various members of the Avengers from past, present and future. Although, its generally random unless another controlling influence, [[Libra (Marvel Comics)|Libra]] is assisting him.<ref>''Avengers: Forever'' Vol 1 #2 (January 1999)</ref>

Rick's latent psionic potential had been once unleashed by the Kree Supreme Intelligence, but he is unable to utilize it at will.<ref>''The Avengers'' Vol 1 #89 (June 1971)</ref> He were also able to shift [[Dimension|dimensional]] positions with [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Mar-Vell]], and later [[Genis-Vell]] for a time.

After he was held captive by the Intelligencia and subjected extreme experiments on him,<ref>''Fall of the Hulks: Red Hulk'' Vol 1 #3 (May 2010)</ref> Rick gains the ability to transform into a blue-skinned creature resembling the Abomination with immense physical attributes (even the Red Hulk only causes superficial damage), but stunting his speech patterns similar to the classic Hulk persona.<ref name="HULK2" /> His scales can change color to blend in these surroundings. Following experimentation by MODOK, Rick's human persona became dominant after the price of trapping him in A-Bomb form.<ref>Loeb, Jeph. ''Hulk'' vol. 2 #13 (Oct. 2009). Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Hulk|Bruce]] speculates in this second storyline that is actually a deliberate, albeit subconscious, action on Rick's part stemming from his fear of allowing others to get hurt, because he might do more harm than good. The Hulk's encouragement let him to remain as A-Bomb so he would always be ready for more heroics.<ref>''The Incredible Hulks'' #618. Marvel Comics.</ref> Thanks to the Hulk, Rick now transforms himself at will while maintaining his full intelligence and personality.<ref>''The Incredible Hulks'' #635. Marvel Comics.</ref> Unfortunately, he lost these A-Bomb powers when the Hulk, under a new persona called "Doc Green," decided to eliminate almost all gamma-mutated people. He injected A-Bomb with the dose of his cure, which made Rick completely human once more.<ref name=autogenerated8/>

The consequence of these side effects from his A-Bomb form have affected Rick's brain. According to himself, he can now pick up natural skills lightning-fast. His mind was like a [[sponge]] and Rick directed it through communications, thus becoming an expert in security hacking.<ref name="Avengers Standoff 1"/>

As Subject B, Rick has [[superhuman strength]], enhanced durability, [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]], fingernail claws, and toxikinesis. This highly corrosive [[poison]] from his hands or two mouths could dissolve flesh and negate [[Healing|healing factors]]. The amount of [[acid]] depends on how much he consumes.<ref name="Immortal Hulk #19" />

When he got separated from Subject B's body, Rick obtained new powers - gamma manipulation and [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitation]].<ref>''The Immortal Hulk'' #22-23. Marvel Comics.</ref>

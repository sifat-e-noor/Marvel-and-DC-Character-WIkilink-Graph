The '''Skrulls''' are a [[fictional]] race of extraterrestrial [[shapeshifter]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The Skrulls first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #2 and were created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]. They originated from the planet Skrullos and their empire is located in the [[Andromeda Galaxy]]. Their infiltration of Earth was a major event in the Marvel Comics universe as shown in the [[crossover (fiction)|crossover]] event, ''[[Secret Invasion]]''.

The Skrulls have made numerous appearances in animated television and video games before making their live-action cinematic debut in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film, ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'' (2019). Skrulls have also appeared in ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (2019) and the [[Disney+]] series ''[[WandaVision]]'' and ''[[What If...? (TV series)|What If...?]]'' (both 2021), and will return in the upcoming series ''[[Secret Invasion (TV series)|Secret Invasion]]'' (2023).

==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=January 2019}}
The Skrulls first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #2 and were created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].<ref name="IGNretrospective" /> The Skrulls next appear in ''Fantastic Four'' #18. The four who impersonated the members of the [[Fantastic Four]] next appear in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #92. The concept of the Skrulls would be explored and used throughout multiple storylines, spin-off comics, and derivative projects.

==Fictional history==
Millions of years ago, in the main Marvel continuity,  the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] perform genetic experiments on the [[Reptile|reptilian]] ancestors of the Skrulls, resulting in three branches of Skrulls: the '''Prime''', the '''[[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]]''' and the '''[[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]]'''. Eventually, the three branches battled with one another and the Deviant branch – due to possessing the innate ability to [[shapeshift]] – were triumphant, and wiped out all members of the other two races until only two were left: the Skrull Eternal [[List of Marvel Comics characters: K#Kly'bn|Kly'bn]], and the Prime Skrull of the original non-Deviant Skrull race. Kly'bn implored them to spare his life, as killing him would kill part of their heritage. The Deviants' leader Sl'gur't eventually fell in love with Kly'bn, with the two eventually becoming the gods of the Skrull pantheon.<ref name="Incredible Hercules' 2008">{{Cite comic|writer=[[Greg Pak]] and [[Fred van Lente]]|penciller=Rafa Sandoval|inker=Roger Bonet and Greg Adams|colorist=Marte Gracia, Dennis Calero and Raul Trevino|letterer=Joe Caramagna|editor=Mark Paniccia|story=Secret Invasion|title=The Incredible Hercules|volume=|issue=#120|date=August 2008|publisher=Marvel Comics||location=United States}}</ref> Taking the name the Prime Skrull, the last original Skrull escaped to Earth in the 20th century and later became a member of the [[Underground Legion]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Glenn Herdling]]|penciller=[[Angel Medina (artist)|Angel Medina]]|inker=Bill Anderson|colorist=Ray Murtaugh|letterer=Jack Morelli|title=Blackwulf|volume=1|issue=#2|date=July 1994|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}</ref> From that point on, the Skrulls began to expand their territory. The Deviant branch later split into two more groups, the modern Skrulls and an anomaly called the [[Dire Wraith]]s.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Bill Mantlo]]|penciller=[[Sal Buscema]]|inker=Ian Akin and Brian Garvey|colorist=Ben Sean|letterer=Janice Chiang|editor=Bob Haras|story=Assistant Editor's Month 1984|title=Rom|volume=|issue=#50|date=January 1984|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}</ref>

The Skrulls originated from the planet Skrullos, and were originally a mercantile civilization, primarily interested in [[free trade]] and willing to share their [[technology]] with all races they deemed worthy. When they encountered a new race, they simply transformed themselves to resemble that race. The Skrull Empire that resulted from these contacts was based on free trade and mutual cooperation.

===Kree–Skrull War===
{{main|Kree–Skrull War}}
Eventually, the Skrulls developed long-distance space travel; a great tour of the universe was undertaken, led by Emperor Dorrek. Finally, the Skrull delegation reached the planet Hala, home to the then-barbaric [[Kree]] and the peaceful [[Cotati (comics)|Cotati]], and held a contest to determine which of the races would represent Hala to the Skrull Empire. Seventeen members of each race were taken to different uninhabited planetoids, where they were left with sufficient supplies for one year. At the end of that period, whichever group had done the most with themselves would be adjudged the most worthy. The Kree were taken to Earth's [[Blue Area of the Moon|Moon]] where they built a great city, while the Cotati were taken to another barren world in a different solar system and used their abilities to create a beautiful park. Realizing that the Cotati were going to win, the enraged Kree killed all of them. When the Kree revealed that they had solved the question of who would represent Hala to the Skrulls by destroying their opposition, the Skrull delegates were appalled and vowed that Hala would forever be banned from their circle of favored worlds—so the Kree massacred them as well, took over the Skrull landing spaceship by force, and developed their own technology from it.

Because of the immense distances involved, decades passed before the Skrulls learned of the Kree's activities. By this time, however, it was too late. The Kree were now advanced and audacious enough to attack the Skrulls in their home galaxy. During the millennia that followed, the Kree aggression forced the Skrulls to become a militaristic civilization, and the Skrulls eventually developed the vicious streak needed to conduct intergalactic war. Their entire culture was remade in the warrior image. The [[Kree–Skrull War]] continued for thousands of years with only brief interruptions.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Steve Englehart]]|penciller=Sal Buscema|inker=Joe Staton|colorist=Phil Rachelson|letterer=Tom Orzechowski|title=Avengers|volume=|issue=#133–134|date=March–April 1975|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}</ref> The Skrull Throneworld is later moved from Skrullos to the more central Tarnax IV, with their empire encompassing over fifty worlds.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Scott Edelman]]|penciller=[[Al Milgrom]]|inker=Terry Austin|colorist=Irene Vartanoff|letterer=Joe Rosen and Gaspar Saladino|editor=[[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]]|title=Captain Marvel|volume=|issue=#51|date=July 1977|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}</ref> The Skrulls also created the first [[Cosmic Cube]], which later became the [[Shaper of Worlds]]; the Shaper related that, upon attaining self-awareness, he lashed out blindly, destroying two-thirds of the Skrull Empire and casting the civilization back into barbarism (suggesting this occurred before the war with the Kree broke out).<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Peter Gillis]]|penciller=Brian Postman|inker=Kim DeMulder|colorist=Bob Sharen|letterer=Diana Albers|editor=Mark Gruenwald|title=Captain America Annual|issue=#7|date=October 1983|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}</ref>

The Kree Accuser [[Ronan the Accuser|Ronan]] had wrested control of the Kree Empire from the [[Supreme Intelligence]] and attacked the Skrulls, reigniting hostilities. The [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] become involved once the [[Super-Skrull]] kidnapped [[Mar-Vell|Captain Marvel]] and, in turn, they battled a Kree [[Sentry (Kree)|Sentry]] robot, three of the four original Skrulls that had fought the Fantastic Four, [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents, rogue [[Inhumans]] and legions of Skrulls. The Supreme Intelligence ended the immediate conflict by revealing to the Avengers' ally [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] that he had vast mental potential, which was then used to freeze all combatants in place.

===Empire-changing events===
The Skrulls became aware of Earth when they discovered a space warp linking Earth and Throneworld. Later, they discovered Earth possesses an equidistant link to Hala. They see Earth as a world to conquer, but they are content to hold off a full invasion. Because of their caution, the Skrulls have sent only a handful of scout warriors to infiltrate Earth, but failed to take into account the presence of the modern [[superhero]].

In 1958, Skrulls attempted to sabotage Earth's space program. They battled the [[3-D Man]], and set the Cold Warrior against the 3-D Man.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Roy Thomas|penciller=[[Jim Craig (comics)|Jim Craig]]|inker=Dave Hunt|colorist=George Roussos|letterer=John Costanza|title=Marvel Premiere|volume=|issue=#35–37|date=April–August 1977|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}</ref> Later, a small scouting party used their shape-shifting powers to impersonate the [[Fantastic Four]], committing crimes so the country would turn against the Fantastic Four, the only ones with the power to stop them at the time. But the Fantastic Four were able to locate the Skrulls and tricked their leaders into believing the Earth was full of threats. The fleet left and Mr. Fantastic made three of the four Skrulls that were left behind shape-shift into cows and he hypnotized them to remember nothing about their true heritage.<ref name="Fantastic Four #2 January 1962">{{Cite comic|writer=Stan Lee|penciller=[[Jack Kirby]]|inker=George Klain and Christopher Rule|title=Fantastic Four|volume=|issue=#2|date=1 January 1962|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}</ref>

In retaliation, the Skrull Emperor Dorrek VII dispatched Kl'rt, a Skrull who was made into the Super-Skrull, to Earth to defeat the Fantastic Four. Kl'rt possessed the combined powers of the entire Fantastic Four (in addition to shape-shifting and [[hypnotism]]), and he held the team at bay until Mister Fantastic discovered the source of his power and used a miniature device to jam the ray, before the Human Torch imprisoned him inside a crater.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Stan Lee|penciller=Jack Kirby|inker=Dick Ayers|colorist=Stan Goldberg|letterer=Artie Simek|title=Fantastic Four|volume=|issue=#18|date=September 1963|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}</ref> The Super-Skrull posed as the jailed Dr. [[Franklin Storm]], after transporting him to the Skrull Throneworld, and battled the Fantastic Four as the Invincible Man.

Later, the cosmic being [[Uatu|Uatu the Watcher]] adjudicates a duel between champions from both races: Colonel Bel-Dann of the Kree and Warlord Raksor of the Skrulls. After one year of conflict, the duel remained deadlocked and was ultimately abandoned, with no resolution.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]|penciller=[[M. D.

Empress R'klll's reign was short-lived, however, as the greatest blow to the Skrulls arrived in the form of the World Devourer [[Galactus]]. After his Herald [[Frankie Raye|Nova]] annihilated the Skrull fleet, Galactus devoured Tarnax IV, killing 7 billion Skrulls, including R'klll and Princess Anelle.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=John Byrne|colorist=Glynis Wein|letterer=Jim Novak|editor=[[Al Milgrom]] and [[Ann Nocenti]]|title=Fantastic Four|volume=|issue=#257|date=August 1983|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}</ref> With the destruction of the central government, the Skrull Empire collapsed into hundreds of bickering factions. Their galaxy was filled with Governors who declared themselves to be Emperor of the Skrulls and soon, a civil war began. The [[Shi'ar]] maintained a heavy presence in the former Empire as well, constantly dealing with pockets of resistance.

===Second Kree–Skrull War===
Later, Reed Richards discovered that yet another Governor-turned-Emperor, Zabyk, had created a genetics bomb, which, when it exploded, made all the Skrulls lose their shape-shifting abilities. Whatever form they were in, they were stuck in at the time of the explosion.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Roger Stern]]|penciller=John Byrne|inker=Kyle Baker|colorist=Christie Scheele|letterer=John Workman|editor=Mark Gruenwald|title=The Avengers Annual|volume=|issue=#14|date=30 July 1985|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}};

In desperation, since without their shape-shifting powers they were vulnerable, they managed to kidnap the herald of Galactus Nova in an attempt to get Galactus to destroy Kree worlds for them. Their plot failed when the [[Silver Surfer]] helped Galactus rescue Nova in exchange for his freedom from Earth.

When the Celestials made an appearance, this scared the Skrulls into starting a second war with the Kree to show they were not powerless. The attack was first made by Kylor, one of five governors claiming to be Emperor. He had a spy in the Kree Empire, Nenora, who gave him the early edge. They tried to hide their secret weakness at all costs from the Kree.

Kylor was eventually betrayed by Nenora, as was the entire Skrull race. She assumed power of the Empire and wished to keep it for herself. It was Empress S'byll who stepped up to control the Skrulls and finish the war. She was able to resurrect the Super-Skrull and he returned to find the empire in shambles. They tricked the Silver Surfer into attacking a [[Badoon]] fleet, which he was not aware were allied with the Kree. Since the Kree waged war on the Surfer, he allied himself with the Skrulls to save Zenn-La from destruction.

To restore their powers, the Super-Skrull's DNA needed to be transferred to S'byll, because only a female could spread the ability to the other Skrulls. The Surfer helped them to power a machine that would return the Empress' shape-shifting abilities. The device was successful. With this power, she was able to restore every Skrull she touched and became the true Empress of the Skrulls.

She and the Super-Skrull waged war with the Kree with the help of the Silver Surfer. She replaced the Super-Skrull with Captain Reptyl and he helped to change her into an emotionless reptile. But Reptyl was betrayed by one of his own and the Skrull fleet was utterly destroyed by the Kree. S'byll and the Silver Surfer went alone to attack the Kree homeworld of Hala.

Gaining the knowledge that Nenora was actually a Skrull gave them the advantage. S'byll gave her shape-shifting abilities back to her, crippling her and showing the Kree her true self. A peace treaty was created.

The Skrulls eventually broke that peace treaty, as they kept their military drive and prefer to fight rather than negotiate. Among the other races contained within the Skrull Empire are the Druff, Guna, Kallusina, Morani, Pheragot, Queega, Tekton, and Yirbek races. Other races remain independent, whether through treaties or open resistance. Such races include the Clegrimites, Gegku, Krylorians, Wilameanis, and [[Xandarian]]s. The Skrull-Xandarian war with the Xandarians recently ended with the destruction of Xandar by the supervillainess [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Steve Englehart]]|penciller=[[Marshall Rogers]] and [[Ron Lim]]|inker=Joe Rubinstein, Tom Christopher and Keith Williams|colorist=Tom Vincent|letterer=John Workman and Ken Bruzenak|editor=[[Michael Higgins (comics)|Michael Higgins]], Mike Rockwitz and [[Craig Anderson (comics)|Craig Anderson]]|title=Silver Surfer|volume=3|issue=#1–31|date=July 1987 – December 1989|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}</ref>

===Warskrulls===
A group of genetically-bred Skrulls called the Warskrulls began infiltrating the Shi'ar Empire.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Chris Claremont|penciller=[[Jim Lee]]|inker=Scott Williams|colorist=Joe Rosas|letterer=Pat Brosseau|editor=Bob Haras|title=The Uncanny X-Men|volume=|issue=#276|date=May 1991|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}</ref> They used a Nexus Amplifier to assume total physical discorporation of their targets, adopting their superpowers along with their physical appearance. They captured and replaced the Starjammers with members of their race, as well as key components in government. The Warskrulls, acting under the direction of the paramount among them, posing as a Shi'ar called the Chamberlain, began committing murders and even genocide upon various Shi'ar affiliated races, such as the P!ndyr, in the name of the Shi'ar Empire. One Warskrull replaced the Imperial Consort, [[Professor X]], called himself Warlord, and took mental control over [[Lilandra]], the Majestrix of the Shi'ar. They were eventually defeated by the combined forces of [[Deathbird]] and the [[X-Men]] and later the Shi'ar vowed to weed out any other Warskrulls.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Chris Claremont|penciller=Jim Lee|inker=Scott Williams|colorist=Joe Rosas|letterer=Tom Orzechowski|editor=Bob Haras|title=The Uncanny X-Men|volume=1|issue=#277|date=June 1991|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}</ref>

===Infiltrating Earth===
Some time later, a Skrull called [[Paibok|Paibok the Power Skrull]] mounted a campaign to invade Earth, using another Skrull called [[Lyja]] as an infiltrator. The plan involved secretly replacing the real [[Alicia Masters]], the Thing's blind lover. The plan fell through when she instead seduced the Human Torch and the two eventually married one another. The long-running facade eventually came to light and the group discovered that the real, human Alicia was actually being held captive by the Skrull nation and Lyja defected, having fallen in love with the [[Human Torch]]. The Fantastic Four rescued her, but Lyja seemingly died in the process as she sacrificed herself to save Johnny when Paibok attacked.

Paibok later revealed to [[Devos the Devastator]] that she was still alive. Paibok, with the assistance of Devos, awoke Lyja from her comatose state and gave her the power to fly and fire energy blasts from her hands (she called herself "Lyja the Lazerfist"). These powers were later revealed to come from a special device implanted in her. Joining them in search of vengeance, the three arrived on Earth, and battled the Torch at Empire State University. The Torch panicked, used his nova flame and destroyed the campus. Alongside Devos and Paibok, Lyja witnessed a battle between the Fantastic Four and an alternate Fantastic Four. However, Lyja still bore feelings for the Torch and once again betrayed her cohorts to side with the Fantastic Four. This ended with the Fantastic Four destroying the "Skrull War World", the Skrulls' largest attack ship.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Tom DeFalco]]|penciller=[[Paul Ryan]]|inker=Danny Bulanadi|colorist=Christie Scheele|letterer=Bill Oakley|editor=[[Ralph Macchio (editor)|Ralph Macchio]]|title=Fantastic Four|volume=|issue=#358|date=November 1991|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}</ref>

===Cadre K===
A group of Skrulls traveled to Earth, where they began plotting to invade the planet once again. They were, however, at some point approached by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], who wanted to lure together 12 powerful mutants that he needed to ascend to godhood. At the same time, the body of the Living Monolith, who had been hurled out into the far reaches of space by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], is found and brought back to Earth. On Earth, a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] Skrull named Fiz snuck into [[X-Mansion|Xavier's mansion]] to tell them urgent news of trouble: the Skrulls have allied themselves with someone powerful and the only thing he knows is that there are 12 mutants that cannot be harmed and that something terrible is going to happen. Fiz also reveals the existence of a subtype of Skrulls that possess innate powers like Earth's mutants. Deemed outcasts by the other Skrulls, they were hunted by the Empire.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Alan Davis]] and [[Terry Kavanagh]]|penciller=Alan Davis|inker=Mark Farmer|colorist=Marie Javins|letterer=Richard Starkings and Saida Temofonte|editor=Mark Powers|story=Shattering|title=X-Men|volume=2|issue=#94|date=November 1999|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}</ref>

After the eventual defeat of Apocalypse, Professor X went into space to train them, giving them the name Cadre K. Cadre K and Xavier returned to Earth during the [[Kree|Ruul]]'s attempt to overtake the planet by turning it into an intergalactic prison. A wounded Z'Cann attempted to pass on vital information to [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]. Their physical contact affected Rogue's powers for some time.

A group of Warskrulls attacked a remote Shi'ar space station and took it over. Disguised as Shi'ar, they were taken aboard the space station willingly and slaughtered all those aboard, except a few needed to keep working the ship. The group, however was eventually defeated by a group of X-Men ([[Darwin (comics)|Darwin]], [[Havok (comics)|Havok]], [[Rachel Summers|Marvel Girl]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], Professor X and [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]]).

===''Secret Invasion''===
In the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' series by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[Leinil Yu]], a flailing Skrull Empire, under the leadership of newcomer Queen [[Veranke]], made an all-out effort to infiltrate and conquer Earth. It was revealed that the Skrulls had infiltrated Earth for quite some time by capturing and replacing many of Earth's heroes. They followed this infiltration with their main assault group. This wave of Skrulls then formed new versions of the [[Super-Skrull]], with each possessing the abilities of several different heroes. Their invasion ultimately failed, costing the life of Veranke, and reducing their numbers even further.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Brian Michael Bendis]]|penciller=[[Leinil Yu]]|inker=Mark Morales|colorist=Laura Martin|letterer=Chris Eliopoulos|editor=Tom Brevoort|title=Secret Invasion|issue=#1–8|date=April–December 2008|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}</ref> Even their gods were slain, and the Japanese God of Evil [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]] took over their Pantheon, leading to the events of ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]''.<ref name="Incredible Hercules' 2008"/>

===Re-establishing the Empire and ''Infinity''===
After the events of ''Secret Invasion'', the Skrulls, now reduced in numbers, became very segmented with various factions rising up around Warlords that began plotting to rise back to power by orchestrating events for their own benefit.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Dan Abnett]] and [[Andy Lanning]]|penciller=[[Tan Eng Huat]]|inker=Victor Olazaba|colorist=June Chung|letterer=Joe Caramagna|editor=Bill Rosemann|title=Annihilators|issue=#3|date=4 May 2011|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}</ref>

===''Infinity Countdown''===
During the search of the Infinity Stones in the ''Infinity Countdown'' storyline, Razor reveals the true origin of the Tree of Shadows; according to Razor, the Tree of Shadows was created eons ago by one of the [[Elders of the Universe]] known as the Gardener, who tried to bring life to the Null Space and planted it in the [[Darkforce Dimension]]. Eventually the Null Space and the Tree of Shadows were discovered by a more prehistoric version of the Shi'ar and the Skrulls, a find that erupted in a war between the two alien races. The war raged until one member of the Shi'ar was able to grasp one of the seeds of the Tree. His physiology, fear and beliefs shaped the birth of the most vicious killing machine the universe had ever seen, the first Raptor and while the Skrulls, being shape-shifters, were still able to hold out against the Shi'ar, they eventually were nevertheless slaughtered by Raptor Prime, a creature of instinct and adaptation which quickly learnt to use their enemies' shape-shifting abilities as well.<ref>''Infinity Countdown: Darkhawk'' #2.

==Biology==
Skrulls are green-skinned [[Reptile|reptilian]] humanoids with large pointed ears, red or green eyes, and chins with several vertical folds in the skin below their mouths. Skrulls are known for genetic and molecular instability and genetic diversity, due to Celestial experimentation creating the Skrull [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]]. The Skrulls are known for their physical malleability and ability to [[shapeshift]] to any size, shape, or color at will, taking on the appearance but not the characteristics of other beings and objects. Skrulls are able to assume virtually any form, be it organic (e.g., cows <ref name="Fantastic Four #2 January 1962"/>) or inorganic (e.g., lamps <ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Roger Stern|penciller=John Byrne|inker=Kyle Baker|colorist=Christie Scheele|letterer=John Workman|editor=Mark Gruenwald|title=The Avengers Annual|volume=|issue=#14|date=30 July 1985|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}</ref>). As a result, the Skrulls excel at spying and infiltration. Skrulls are also able to use their shapeshifting abilities to form weapons (e.g., blades and clubs) with parts of their bodies, making them dangerous hand-to-hand combatants. Their [[sexual dimorphism]] is roughly the same of a human being, with the exception that the males are mostly bald and have no facial hair, while females have full head of greenish-black [[hair]], but their [[sexual orientation]] is more complex, since they can change their genders at will. Indeed, [[Xavin]] once casually said that, for a Skrull, changing gender is comparable to a human being changing their hair color.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Brian K. Vaughan]]|penciller=[[Takeshi Miyazawa]]|inker=Craig Yeund|colorist=Christina Strain|letterer=Randy Gentile|editor=MacKenzie Cadenhead|title=Runaways|volume=2|issue=#8|date=November 2005|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}</ref> As for their reproductive system, just like the other reptilians, the females do not give live birth, but instead lay [[egg]]s and the newborns are known as "hatchlings".<ref>{{Cite comic|title=[[Marvel Fact Files]]|issue=#2|date=March 2013|location= United States|publisher= Marvel Comics}}</ref> However, despite being reptilian, the females also possesses hair and [[mammary glands]] to nurture their newborn, just like a human being.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer= [[Mark Gruenwald]] and [[Peter Sanderson]]|inker= Josef Rubinstein|colorist= Andy Yanchus|editor= Mark Gruenwald and Howard Mackie|title=Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|volume=2|issue=#12|date= November 1986|location= United States|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>

Courtesy of their advanced technology, the Skrulls have also been able to augment their abilities in certain warriors, such as the Super-Skrull, Power Skrull and the Warskrulls—all elite groups who, with special encoding, are able to emulate the powers as well as the appearance of their biophysical templates or are bestowed entirely unique supertropical abilities all their own (in the case of Paibok).<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Chris Claremont|penciller=Jim Lee|inker=Scott Williams|colorist=Joe Rosas|letterer=Pat Brosseau|editor=Bob Harris and Suzanne Gaffney|title=The Uncanny X-Men|volume=|issue=#274–277|date=March – June 1991|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}</ref>

The Skrulls have been shown to suffer from various diseases.

===Squadron Supreme===
The '''Skrullian Skymaster''' (real name '''Skymax''') is a founding member of the [[Squadron Supreme]] and possesses abilities matching the Super-Skrull from [[Earth-616]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Len Kaminski]]|penciller=[[Anthony Williams (comics)|Anthony Williams]]|inker=Andy Lanning|colorist=Tom Smith|letterer=[[Richard Starkings]] and Comicraft|editor=Tom Brevoort|title=Squadron Supreme: New World Order|volume=|date=September 1998|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}</ref> The character first appeared in flashback in ''Squadron Supreme'' #1 (1989), and appeared in more detail in ''Squadron Supreme: New World Order''.

In an alternate reality to that in [[Earth-616|which most Marvel Comics stories]] take place, the Skrull Empire has been at war with the Kree Empire. In an attempt to end the bloodshed, the Skrull Empire created a means to imbue their soldiers with extraordinary powers to vanquish the Kree. Skymax was the first and the only soldier subjected to the experiments, because the [[Galactus|World Devourer]] destroyed the Skrull homeworld. Sk'ym'x was in the vicinity of Earth when his [[starship]] malfunctioned. He was rescued by American astronaut Joe Ledger (who would later become [[Doctor Spectrum]]). Grateful for his rescue, Skymax gave Ledger a Power Prism, which Ledger used to become the costumed adventurer Doctor Spectrum, while Skymax became the costumed adventurer known as the Skrull. Skymax and Ledger both became founding members of the [[Squadron Supreme]], and Skymax remained with the team until member [[Tom Thumb (comics)|Tom Thumb]] repaired his ship, allowing him to return to space. Skymax realized that the damage to his ship was beyond repair despite Tom Thumb's efforts, and he chose to remain on Earth in secret, searching for any possibility of other Skrull survivors. Not finding any, Skymax concluded that he was indeed the last of his race; he remained on Earth.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After the Squadron Supreme returned from their adventures on Earth-616, the sorcerer Mysterium sent the surviving members to retrieve others to help in the rebellion against the Global Directorate. Doctor Spectrum was sent after "the Watcher" and discovered Skymax. Renaming himself the Skrullian Skymaster and revealing his true origin to Doctor Spectrum, Skymax rejoined the Squadron Supreme and settled with them on Utopia Isle.<ref>''Squadron Supreme: New World Order'' (September 1998). Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the 2021 "[[Heroes Reborn (2021 comic)|Heroes Reborn]]" reality, the Skrullian Skymaster was established as a former member of the Squadron Supreme of America. While trying to break up the protests caused by mutants over a bill that would start the Mutant Registration Act, the Skrullian Skymaster killed Mystique with his flame attacks. This caused Rogue to use her life-draining powers to avenge her adoptive mother by killing the Skrullian Skymaster.<ref>''Heroes Reborn: Magneto & The Mutant Force'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
The Skrulls are led by the billion-year-old Skrull Emperor Kl'rt. The Skrulls dislike being confused with the [[Chitauri]] whom they call terrorists. They have extremely advanced technology, but have not been observed to shapeshift. These Skrulls were seen only in an [[alternate timeline]] in which [[Maker (Reed Richards)|Reed Richards]] contacted their world via his teleporter; the events leading to that timeline were altered in ''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #29 so that contact was never made.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Mark Millar]]|penciller=[[Greg Land]]|inker=Matt Ryan|colorist=Justin Ponsor|letterer=Randy Gentile|editor=[[Ralph Macchio (editor)|Ralph Macchio]], [[John Barber (comic)|John Barber]] and Nicole Wiley Boose|title=Ultimate Fantastic Four|issue=#27 – 29|date=April–June 2004|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}</ref>

====''Secret Invasion''====
On Earth-10021, the Skrulls were victorious in the end of ''Secret Invasion'' and the heroes were defeated. In this reality, the Skrulls were coexisting along with the humans on Earth and were seen by humans as people with good intentions. Despite helping the humans in medical care and technology, in reality, they are secretly turning the humans into Skrulls like themselves, including Norman Osborn, who had married Queen Veranke, while the heroes had been hiding in [[Wakanda]], since now they were seen as criminals. In the end, the heroes spread a virus which killed every Skrull and the humans who had been turned into Skrulls, except for Osborn, who had been disguised as Iron Man. Osborn revealed that he had orchestrated the plan all along, but he was killed by [[Bucky Barnes]]. The heroes were then taken by the U.S. government as world criminals.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Kevin Grevioux]] and Karl Bollers|penciller=[[Pow Rodrix]]|colorist=Frank Martin|letterer=Jeff Powell|editor=[[Justin Gabriel]] and A.J.

'''Caiera''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was introduced during the "[[Planet Hulk]]" storyline. She first appeared in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|Incredible Hulk]]'' vol. 3 #92 (April 2006), and was created by [[Greg Pak]] and [[Carlo Pagulayan]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=68}}</ref>

Caiera was born on Sakaar to a tribe of Shadow People, the creators of the Old Power. She was raised by the priests to be a shadow warrior. When she was thirteen, her village was attacked by alien "spikes" that caused the other villagers to mutate into monsters. Caiera, the only survivor, was rescued by the Red Prince. When the Red Prince becomes the Red King, Caiera is his loyal lieutenant and the mother of his daughter. When the [[Hulk]] arrives on Sakaar and gains public support as a gladiator, she protects the Red King from him. After a failed attempt to ruin his popularity, the Hulk and his [[Warbound]] escape.
Caiera is sent to kill the Hulk, but they encounter spikes during their battle. The Red King reveals he controls the spikes, devastating her. She turns against the Red King and aids the Hulk in a coup. Hulk becomes the Green King, and he marries Caiera. She becomes pregnant but dies in the warp core explosion which laid waste to much of the planet.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 3 #104</ref><ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 3 #105</ref> Hulk returned to Earth in [[World War Hulk]].<ref>''World War Hulk'' #1–5</ref> Although Caiera died, she posthumously – through the Old Power – gave birth to two sons, spawned from beneath the surface of the planet: [[Skaar (character)|Skaar]] and [[Hiro-Kala]].<ref>''Skaar: Son of Hulk'' #8</ref><ref>''Skaar: Son of Hulk'' #10</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
Caiera possessed abilities that were derived from the planet itself. She could transform her body into stone and become incredibly resistant and strong, to the extent that she battled the Hulk to a standstill even when his strength and fighting skills had dramatically increased. She was also an expert fighter and tactician.

===Other versions of Caiera===
An issue of [[What If (comics)|''What If?'']] examined what would have happened if Caiera had survived the explosion instead of Hulk. Angered at the loss of her husband, Caiera takes the entirety of her planet's energy into herself, vastly increasing her power. She then goes to Earth to avenge his death. She kills the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] and enslaves Earth.

However, it later turns out that the Red King was the one who created the Spikes, thus he is responsible for destroying Caiera's village and killing her people. Once the truth is revealed, Caiera angrily severs her loyalty to the Red King and aids the Hulk and the Warbound in defeating him. Caiera then plants a Spike bug on the Red King, leaving him to be killed by his Death Guard robots as revenge. She then goes on to become the Queen Consort to Hulk, who accepts his new role as the new King of Sakaar.

==John Carik==
John Carik was featured as the main [[supporting character]] in the mid-1990s series ''[[Blade (comics)|Blade: The Vampire Hunter]]'' and was created by [[Ian Edginton]] and [[Doug Wheatley|Douglas H. Wheatley]]. He was exclusively referred to in the solicitations as '''"Bible John"''', and the use of that nickname was established in the first issue. However, that name was rarely used in other issues. He is one of the last of an order of warrior/scholars named the Cathari, who all take vows to combat the evil forces of the [[supernatural]]. Carik appeared in all issues of ''Blade: The Vampire Hunter'' (July 1994 to April 1995) except Issue #6. The series was cancelled after ten issues leaving John Carik's story unfinished. Carik was attacked by a supernatural being of an undisclosed nature, the encounter giving him [[precognition]]. He was shortly thereafter contacted by and joined the Cathari. Carik is covered from head to toe inwards and sigils that he has carved into his flesh which gives him protection from supernatural beings.

Blade: the Vampire Hunter begins with Carik having a vision of the return of [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]] and the resulting destruction of [[New York City]]. His vision gives him the knowledge that Blade is the only one who can prevent the events from coming true. To warn Blade, Carik escapes from the Nyman Psychiatric Clinic and seeks him out. Once he finds Blade, Carik gives him a witch compass, a device for seeking out the supernatural.

===John Carik in other media===
Although he never made an appearance in the ''[[Blade (film series)|Blade]]'' films or in ''[[Blade: The Series]]'', many of John Carik's character traits are visible in [[Abraham Whistler]]'s character. He was originally intended to appear in ''[[Blade: The Series]]'' (portrayed by [[Marc Singer]]) but was eventually scrapped.

==Luke Carlyle==
Luke Carlyle was created by [[J. Michael Straczynski]] and [[John Romita Jr.]], and first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' vol. 2 #43.<ref name="ASM #43">{{Comic book reference|writer=[[J. Michael Straczynski]]|penciller=[[John Romita Jr.]]|title=[[The Amazing Spider-Man]] (second series) #43–45|date=Oct–Nov 2002|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> He is a thief and [[confidence trick|con man]] who worked his way up the corporate ladder, eventually rising to a trusted position.<ref name="ASM #43"/> When the CEO of the company he worked at discovered Carlyle was a fraud, Carlyle killed him. Lacking the time to act, and with most of the company's assets either gone or unreachable, Carlyle then hired [[Doctor Octopus|Otto Octavius]] under the guise of helping to make him a legitimate researcher, and stole his mechanical appendages. He was finally defeated by a combined effort between Octavius and Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #47</ref>

===Luke Carlyle in other media===
Luke Carlyle, under the alias of '''The Mad Bomber''', appears in the ''[[Spider-Man 3 (video game)|Spider-Man 3]]'' video game, voiced by [[Neil Ross]]. The Mad Bomber is the only villain to be featured across all platforms, besides the three antagonists of the film itself. His public persona is that of a respectable businessman, who secretly uses his wealth to provide for his gang, the '''H-Bombers''', equipment, and weaponry. As their name suggests, the gang's main goal is to destroy New York using explosives, though their motivation remains unknown and their plans are constantly thwarted by Spider-Man. The game's H-Bombers storyline culminates with an attack on the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', during which it is revealed that Carlyle has a vendetta against [[J. Jonah Jameson]], who published a story that exposed Carlyle's company as environmentally damaging, driving him out of business and leading him to create his gang. After Spider-Man thwarts the H-Bombers' attack and rescues Jameson, Carlyle either escapes (in the next-gen version), or is defeated and arrested (in the [[PlayStation 2|PS2]], [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]], and [[Wii]] versions). The [[Game Boy Advance]] version of the game differs drastically from the others. Here, The Mad Bomber doesn't lead the H-Bombers but instead plants several bombs across the city by himself. He is foiled by Spider-Man, who defeats him and hands him over to the police.

'''Century''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]], a [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was depicted as a member of the [[Force Works]] team in the series of the same name from 1994 to 1996.<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=80}}</ref>

Century first appeared in issue #1 of ''[[Force Works]]'' and was created by [[Dan Abnett]], [[Andy Lanning]], and [[Tom Tenney]].

Century was a genetic creation consisting of the minds of the hundred strongest and most able of the surviving alien [[List of alien races in Marvel Comics#H|Hodomurians]]. He possessed all their memories and instinctively used the knowledge he needed. Therefore, he was an expert on many topics and a very skilled fighter, especially with his battle-staff, Parallax. His lifespan was apparently fixed at 100 years. He was sometimes seen [[Levitation|levitating]] while in a deep meditative [[trance]]. He had a symbiotic rapport with Parallax, an entity which bound the multiple personalities of Century into a unified self.

Since developing [[amnesia]], Century couldn't remember much about his past and often had to search for the right words which led to Century sounding like a [[thesaurus]] when he often used three similar words to express himself. Single memories returned when he was confronted with something from his past or he dreamt about it. After losing Parallax for a while, memories of his composite minds loosened and even after Parallax was returned to him he continued to remember bits from the lives of the Hodomur he was composed of.

To defeat the evil Nexus Being named Lore, responsible for the destruction of their world, the Hodomur race created Century, a being composed of the best 100 surviving Hodomur warriors. Possessing all of their memories, he was able to solve situations in many topics. He started a mission to track down Lore, but during inter-dimensional travel, he was enslaved by Broker and brainwashed. Only the urge to find Lore was maintained on his mind. He soon became a "scout" for the evil alien race of the Scatter, which bought him from Broket. Following constantly Century, the Scatter could feast on the leftovers of the worlds destroyed by Lore. Century first encountered the superhero team [[Force Works]] when Scarlet Witch's magic brought the alien on Earth-616 following a battle against the [[Kree]]. Century knocked out Kalum Lo, then when questioned by Scarlet about his whereabouts, was able to say only his name. A few minutes later Scarlet Witch, Spider-Woman, and U.S.Agent were all captured by the Scatter, that arriving on Earth the following Century, and also caused Wonder Man's apparent death. [[Iron Man]] questioned Century about the Scatter's whereabouts but Century knew only the name of their race and their evil goals, causing Stark to leave him behind. He was next to be brought to the [[Vault (Marvel Comics)|Vault]] but escaped and teleported to Iron Man. Using the teleportation powers of his staff Parallax, Century helped Iron Man to rescue the team from an unknown world ravaged by the Scatter. He helped Force Works defeat these aliens. Getting quarter to the Works, he soon joined the team on a full basis participating in missions to Slorenia, China, Australia, and defeating the menace of the Starstealth once and for at all. During a brief travel to space aboard the ship of ''Broker'', he was captured by the foe and sold to the mysterious ''Imogen''. He was then freed by ''Azimuth'', that was next to reveal the truth on his origins and life, but she was stricken by an energy blast of Imogen and fell comatose. After killing Broker for good, he returned to Earth, rejoining Force Works in time to help them unravel the plot of Kang (Immortus in disguise) that had on his side a corrupted Iron Man and Cybermancer, alternate version of scientist Suzi Endo. After Stark sacrificed himself to prevent Kang's plans, Force Works had to endure a last fight against alternate universe versions of [[Wonder Man]], and [[Ultron]], belonging to Cybermancer's reality. Force Works managed to resolve this situation. Before the team was disbanded, Century expressed the desire to learn more about his new homeworld, Earth. Force Works then responded to an emergency call starting for a final mission whose result remained unknown.

Century is later recruited by [[Wonder Man]] (whose ionic energy leaking problem was affecting his judgement) to join his [[Revengers]] in a plot to defeat the Avengers. He was easily defeated by the New Avengers.<ref>''The New Avengers Annual'' vol. 2 #1</ref> While incarcerated at the Raft, Century and the rest of Wonder Man's followers were interrogated about their motivations for joining the Revengers. Century stated that he sided with Wonder Man out of sense of honor to him and recognition of the cycle of life.<ref>''The Avengers Annual'' vol. 4 #1</ref>

As his name and some of his history indicated, Century was meant to be the best of the 100 beings that made him up.

He was shown to have greater than human strength, agility, and endurance. Additionally, by using Parallax, he was able to [[Teleportation|teleport]] through inter-dimensional space. He's also an expert hand-to-hand combatant.

===Century in other media===
* Century appears in ''[[Iron Man (TV series)|Iron Man]]'', voiced by [[James Warwick (actor)|James Warwick]] in season one, [[Jim Cummings]] in "The Beast Within", and by [[Tom Kane]] in the two-part series finale. A scene in the episode "Data In, Chaos Out" gives Century a civilian identity as a man named Woody where he sports shades and a broad-brimmed hat. In "The Beast Within," Century was the one who told Iron Man that the Force Works team is relocating from Stark Industries following Iron Man's team-up with the Mandarin to stop [[Fin Fang Foom]]. In the two-part episode "Hands of the Mandarin," Century rejoins Force Works when Mandarin uses the Heart of Darkness crystal to disable all technology. He appeared to knock out Hypnotia when she was using her powers on Iron Man and War Machine.

Wealthy former professional gambler '''Nicholas Powell''' was looking for more thrill in his life. He decides to become a mercenary criminal-for-hire, incorporating his love of gambling into his work. Anyone who hires him would, instead of directly paying, bet his fee against him actually completing the mission. If Powell (calling himself "Chance") is successful, he receives his fee; if not, he lost the "bet" and owes that amount to his contractors. The thrill of this risk was the only way in which Chance felt the work was truly interesting.

Chance was first hired by the [[Foreigner (comics)|Foreigner]] to kill a [[Fence (criminal)|fence]] named Andre Boullion. Chance wagered his fee at double or nothing that he could kill [[Spider-Man]], but Spider-Man instead defeated him.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #15</ref> Chance was then hired by corrupt city official Robert Phalen to kill a murder witness. His initial attempt was thwarted by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], and his contract was terminated when Phelan died.<ref>''Daredevil'' #246</ref> Chance was hired under pretense by the [[Life Foundation]] to steal a secret arms shipment. The Life Foundation captured him instead, and [[Carlton Drake]] sought to duplicate his wrist blasters. Chance joined forces with Spider-Man to overcome the Life Foundation.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #298–299</ref> Chance was next hired by Mister Grouper to kill casino owner Raymond Trask but was thwarted by Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #336</ref> Trask then hired Chance under the pretense of protecting Trask from an assassination attempt. Instead, Trask unsuccessfully tried to kill him out of revenge.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Annual #25</ref>

During the ''[[Spider-Island]]'' storyline, Chance (alongside [[Scorcher (comics)|Scorcher]] and [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]]) is seen guarding an abandoned lab at Empire State University when Peter Parker and Carlie Cooper arrive. He ends up knocked down by Parker using the moves he learned from [[Shang-Chi]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #669</ref>

Chance later appeared, attempting to kill the rejuvenated [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] during a press conference, only to be defeated by the current [[Falcon (comics)|Captain America]]. While getting arrested, he mentions to Captain America that he was on Pleasant Hill and did not agree with the heroes' actions as a result of the crisis.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #9</ref>

'''Chewie''' is a fictional alien in [[Marvel Comics]]. The character, created by Brian Reed and Roberto De La Torre, first appeared in ''Giant-Size Ms. Marvel'' #1 (April 2006). Her alien origin was invented by [[Kelly Sue DeConnick]] and [[David López (artist)|David López]] for ''Captain Marvel'' vol. 8 #2 (June 2014).

An ordinary-looking cat was caught in between an intense fight between [[Carol Danvers]], then known as [[Ms. Marvel]], and Sir Warren Traveler inside a fiery building.<ref>''Giant-Size Ms. Marvel'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Following this, the cat randomly showed up at Carol's apartment while she was about to give an interview. Carol opted to finally adopt the stray and calls her Chewie because she reminded her of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' character [[Chewbacca]].<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' vol. 2 #4–5. Marvel Comics.</ref> Since then, Chewie made sporadic appearances as a comforting companion throughout Carol's career as Ms. Marvel<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' vol. 2 #17. Marvel Comics.</ref> and when she finally took up the mantle of [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]].<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol. 7 #9-11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

This all changed when Carol took Chewie into space with her and they encountered the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]. [[Rocket Raccoon]] immediately identified Chewie as a Flerken, a species of alien that resembles the Earth cat, but in actuality are dangerous alien creatures. Rocket attempted to kill her before she laid eggs, but Carol stopped him as she did not believe Rocket.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol. 8 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> He ended up being correct, as Chewie laid 117 eggs that all immediately hatched. Carol, Rocket and their friend Tic had to take Chewie and her offspring to a rescue center where Carol planned to drop them off as she could not take care of them all. However, Chewie teleported back to their ship to be with Carol, leaving her offspring behind.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol. 8 #7–8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Empyre]]" storyline, Chewie was instructed by Captain Marvel to keep an eye on her recently discovered half-sister Lauri-Ell. When the [[Cotati (comics)|Cotati]] attack Earth, Chewie assists Captain Marvel and Lauri-Ell by eating some of the Cotati.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol. 10 #19. Marvel Comics.</ref>

She accompanies them on their Quinjet to [[Louisiana]] where they go to [[Maria Rambeau]] and her daughter [[Monica Rambeau]]'s house so Danvers can remember her past. There, the terrified [[Skrull]] [[Talos the Untamed|Talos]] identifies Goose as a Flerken. Goose was present when Talos has a parley with Danvers and Fury. Goose accompanies Danvers, Rambeau, Fury, and Talos into space to a spaceship carrying Skrull refugees. While there, Goose reveals her true nature by using her abilities to defeat [[Kree]] soldiers and swallowing the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]].

'''Clash''' ('''Clayton Cole''') is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Clash first appeared in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #1 (June 2014), and was created by [[Dan Slott]] and [[Ramon Perez]]. While he had a brief criminal career and was granted a spot on Parker Industries upon his reform, he regressed back to his criminal roots during the ''[[Civil War II]]'' storyline.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsarama.com/28484-amazing-spider-man-enters-civil-war-ii.html|title=Newsarama &#124; GamesRadar+}}</ref>

At a young age, Clayton Cole was a smart kid who was home-schooled by his mother. During his youth, he saw [[Peter Parker]]'s Masked Marvel appearance going up against [[Crusher Hogan]] in a wrestling match. Since then, he started working on technology so that he can be like the "Masked Marvel". This led him to being Clash.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In his first time operating as Clash, Cole came into conflict with Spider-Man. He was defeated by Spider-Man and sentenced to [[Youth detention center|juvenile hall]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #1.1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After being released on parole, Clash was working as henchmen for [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]] and other supervillains.<ref name="Civil War II: The Amazing Spider-Man #2">''Civil War II: The Amazing Spider-Man'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Spider-Verse]]" storyline, Clash's latest employer was the [[Kree]] named [[Doctor Minerva]]. When Spider-Man was aided in battle [[Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan)|Ms. Marvel]] and discovered that the latter has taken an [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] baby from Doctor Minerva, Clash turned against Doctor Minerva. Upon recognizing him and seeing that he has gone straight, Spider-Man offered Clash a job at [[Parker Industries]] which he accepted.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Clayton's work at Parker Industries involved Spider-Man's globetrotting adventures like helping out against [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]] to the infiltration of [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]].<ref name="Civil War: The Amazing Spider-Man #3">''Civil War II: The Amazing Spider-Man'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Civil War II]]" storyline, the Inhuman [[#Ulysses Cain|Ulysses Cain]] had a vision where Cole is Clash again and attacks Spider-Man.<ref>''Civil War II: The Amazing Spider-Man'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Cole later meets Sully back when he used to work for Owl and can't talk long without violating parole. Later on, Clayton's parents are displeased that their son is working as an "office drone" while his father wants Peter to help with their retirement. While showing his latest project for the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] to Parker, Clayton is told that he should talk to him if he has any problems. Upon hearing Ulysses' vision of him when he arrives in Peter's office, Clayton resigns from Parker Industries. At Moynihan's Social Club, Clayton tells Sully and another person on how companies like [[Roxxon Energy Corporation]] are destroying the planet. Afterwards, Clayton meets [[Mendel Stromm]] who makes a reference to how [[Norman Osborn]] stole the former's work to be left poor. After providing Clayton with the [[Tinkerer]]'s number, Mendel gives Clayton a day to consider helping in revenge on [[Harry Osborn]]. After calling Tinkerer who makes him an updated Clash suit, Clayton calls up Stromm.<ref name="Civil War II: The Amazing Spider-Man #2"/> In his new suit, Clash arrives at Stromm's apartment where he finds Stromm in the Robot Master appearance and robots. Robot Master then compliments Clash's outfit and claims that Spider-Man won't know what happened. When Clash attacks Robot Master stating that he will look out for himself, Robot Master unleashes his robots on Clash even when Spider-Man arrives. Spider-Man manages to web Robot Master in the air with foam web. When Spider-Man was talking Clash into getting back to the civilized life, Robot Master rises and attacks them. While Clash flies away, Spider-Man defeats Robot Master by ripping the remote control mechanics from within the robot body, deactivating the robot army. When Clayton states that he was trying to protect Parker Industries from Stromm, Spider-Man stated that he caused harm with his technology, caused millions of dollars worth of damages, and violated his parole. Though Parker did talk to Clayton's [[Probation officer|parole officer]] where he stated that Clayton acted in self-defense and that Clayton will have to give up on working on sonic technology. Though Clayton doesn't seem to agree with Spider-Man's proposal to discontinue his work on his sonic technology which leads to Ulysses' vision coming true.<ref name="Civil War: The Amazing Spider-Man #3"/> After battling Spider-Man on the streets, Clash escapes and returns to the Moynihan's Social Club where he decides to be a crime boss.<ref>''Civil War II: The Amazing Spider-Man'' #4, Marvel Comics.</ref>

Clash was seen at the closed Now Forever Nightclub where he discusses with his thugs the plans to take back his inventions that he made for Parker Industries to evade them being sold to pay off some debts. When Clash enters the Baxter Building to take back the Sonic Transducer, Harry sees that something is off and alerts Spider-Man and the [[Human Torch]]. Due to a self-charging power source getting stuck in the upward cycle, Clash had to work with Spider-Man and Human Torch to deactivate it. While Spider-Man catches Clash's thugs, he allows Clash to get away.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #790. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "Go Down Swinging" storyline, Peter later persuades Clash to look over the Osborn family in light of the Red Goblin's threat. At [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]], Clash assists Human Torch in protecting the Osborn family from Red Goblin.

'''Comet''' ('''Harris Moore''') is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]]. He first appeared in ''[[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] #21'' (September 1978), and was created by [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[John Buscema]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=91}}</ref>

In the late 1950s, radiation from a gaseous entity resembling a tiny comet mutagenically altered him, giving him superhuman flying and electrical powers, which he used as a costumed crimefighter. Decades later, he went to [[Xandar]] to aid its people in their war against the [[Skrull]]s as one of the [[Champions of Xandar]]. After his son [[Crimebuster (Marvel Comics)|Crimebuster]] died, the Comet chose to remain on Xandar.

==Copycat==
'''Copycat''' ('''Vanessa Geraldine Carlysle''') is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Copycat first appeared in ''[[X-Force]]'' #19 (February [[1993 in comics|1993]]), where the character was [[retconned]] to the first appearance of [[Domino (comics)|Domino]] in ''[[The New Mutants (comic book)|The New Mutants]]'' #98  (February [[1991 in comics|1991]]), and was created by [[Fabian Nicieza]] and [[Greg Capullo]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=93}}</ref>The character has been depicted as a former member of [[X-Force]]. Copycat is such a powerful and precise [[shapeshifting|metamorph]] that she can duplicate another being down to the cellular level.

Actress [[Morena Baccarin]] portrays a non-mutant Vanessa Carlysle in the 2016 film ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]'' and the 2018 film ''[[Deadpool 2]]''.

===Fictional character biography===
The daughter of Dorothy and the late Burt Carlysle, of New Brunswick, New Jersey,<ref>Deadpool: The Circle Chase, #2, Sep. 1993</ref> as a young [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] shape-shifter kicked out of her home, Vanessa Carlysle fell into a life of prostitution in [[Boston]] where she met and fell in love with a mercenary named [[Deadpool|Wade Wilson]]. Carlysle was soon saved from Wilson's vengeful employers by Zoe Culloden, a time-traveling agent of [[Landau, Luckman, and Lake]] who had journeyed into the past to prevent Wilson's eventual self-destruction. That night, Wilson broke up with Carlysle after learning he had terminal illness, leaving her heartbroken. Carlysle became a mercenary herself, eventually employed by arms-dealer [[Genesis (Marvel Comics)|Tolliver]].

Under his orders, Copycat infiltrated [[X-Force]] in the shape of [[Domino (comics)|Domino]] while the real Domino was a prisoner. Her mission was to blow up X-Force's headquarters to kill [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], but she became attached to the team members, fell in love with Cable and didn't go through with her mission. Tolliver sent Deadpool to force her to set the bomb. Deadpool would be put in her place, if she refused. Deadpool revealed Copycat's cover to X-Force, and left them for dead by blowing up the complex without knowing that X-Force had already escaped.

Vanessa briefly hid herself under the false identity (as a twin) of one of her friends; Tina Valentino. Deadpool and his associate, Sluggo, believing they killed her, killed Tina instead. She then moved in with [[Garrison Kane]] in [[San Francisco]], until Cable found them.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Cable|Issue = 37|Date = Nov. 1996|Publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref> She was subsequently captured by the emotion-manipulating [[Psycho-Man]], who sought Kane's advanced technology, but was rescued from the [[Microverse]] by Kane, Cable, Domino and the Microverse's resident heroes, the Microns. Later, she broke up with Kane and came back to live with Deadpool. Deadpool's feelings towards [[Siryn]] grew, so she left him after having taken his appearance to attack her, in hopes of souring their potential relationship.

Some time later, Copycat was captured by [[Weapon X]]. The treatments of Weapon X destroyed her memory and she forgot her mission. Recruited by [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], Deadpool received an order to kill her. He tried to warn her, so Weapon X sent Kane to kill the both of them. The fight took them to a local zoo where Deadpool left her in a shapechanged-gorilla form among other gorillas to fight against Kane. When he returned, the other gorillas were dead and Copycat was dying from wounds inflicted by Sabretooth. She died shortly after in Deadpool's arms.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Deadpool|Volume = 1|Issue = 59|Date = Dec. 2001|Publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref>

However, Deadpool had poured an amount of his blood into Copycat's wounds, which, unknown to him, healed her. Vanessa then took up the identity of an owner of a chimichanga stand, and later cheated Deadpool out of one of his past marriages.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Deadpool|Volume = 3|Issue = 27|Date = 2014|Publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref>

Copycat is such a powerful and precise [[shapeshifting|metamorph]] that she can duplicate another being down to the cellular level. Because of this, she is able to replicate superhuman powers, abilities, and even mental imprints so closely that telepaths have trouble identifying her. Copycat simply requires knowledge to duplicate someone's appearance, but needs physical contact to duplicate anything else. She is also capable of turning into animals, finding these forms easier to maintain than human shape.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Deadpool|Volume = 1|Issue = 59|Date = Dec. 2001|Publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref> Weapon X modified her powers by accelerating the rate at which she could duplicate others. However, as a side effect of this enhancement, Copycat began to lose her memory and was unable to hold any solid form for long periods of time.

===Other versions of Copycat===

In the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' reality, Copycat was a member of the Brotherhood of Chaos, an elite religious group affiliated to the Church of the [[Multiple Man|Madri]]. She served alongside other members such as [[Madison Jeffries]] and [[Spyne]]. She was often referred to as Sister Vanessa or Sister Carlysle. Using her shape-shifting powers, Copycat was able to hide incognito amongst the humans who had hoped to flee North America and was able to discover the site of the Sentinel Evacuation while in their midst. Vanessa led the Brotherhood to an emigration site in Maine and there they clashed with the Amazing X-Men. In an attempt to elude the X-Man Quicksilver, Copycat posed as Scarlet Witch, but was forced to revert to her normal self by Dazzler. Both Copycat and Box were able to escape the X-Men and conceal themselves, posing as humans, and escaped to Europe. They were discovered at a checkpoint and provided a distraction for a group of Altered Humans to pass through, but were subsequently hunted down by Weapon X and Jean Grey, with the latter slaying Vanessa in the process.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Weapon X|Volume = 1|Issue = 2|Date = Apr. 1995|Publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref>

In the ''[[Age of X]]'' reality, Copycat infiltrated Cannonball's X-Force when she worked for the Human Coalition. She was unmasked and killed by Husk.

Though she sports a telltale streak of white hair and references are made to the "roles" she has played, Vanessa has not demonstrated any mutant powers as of yet that relate to her comic-book counterpart. This is due to writers [[Rhett Reese]] and [[Paul Wernick]] deciding the reveal would be too confusing, although they have expressed interest in exploring the idea in a future story.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Eisenberg|first1=Eric|title=Deadpool Decided Not To Turn This Character Into A Mutant, Here's Why|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Deadpool-Decided-Turn-Character-Mutant-Here-Why-112447.html|website=Cinema Blend|accessdate=23 April 2018}}</ref> She is in a relationship with and got engaged to [[Deadpool|Wade Wilson]], later learning of his cancer.

After he rescued her, Vanessa was initially angry with Deadpool for abandoning her, though she reconciled with him upon learning of his plight.
* Vanessa appears in the live-action sequel film ''[[Deadpool 2]]'', with Morena Baccarin reprising her role. Vanessa and Wade celebrate their anniversary and discuss starting a family.

After Deadpool sacrifices himself to save Russell, he and Vanessa are temporarily reunited, but she tells him it is not his time yet and sends him back. In a mid-credits scene, Deadpool uses Cable's time-travel device to avert Vanessa's death.

'''Delphine Courtney''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]], an enemy of the super-team [[Alpha Flight]].

===Publication history===
Delphine Courtney first appeared in ''Alpha Flight'' #7 (February 1984), and was created by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]].

The character subsequently appears in ''Alpha Flight'' #11–13 (June–August 1984), ''Alpha Flight'' #22 (May 1985), and ''Alpha Flight'' #25–28 (August–November 1985).

Delphine Courtney appeared as part of the "Omega Flight" entry in ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition]]'' #9.

===Fictional character biography===
Delphine Courtney was a servitor robot, built by the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation]] to serve [[Jerry Jaxon]]. The robot initially had a fully feminine human appearance, and was referred to as "she" by its creators to the point that Jaxon himself was unaware of "her" true nature.<ref name="AF12">''Alpha Flight'' #12 (July 1984)</ref> Courtney acted on Jaxon's behalf to recruit several superhumans that were former members of [[Gamma Flight]] and [[Beta Flight]] (the [[Canada|Canadian]] government's training teams) that were dismissed after the government closed [[Department H]], the division that oversaw Gamma, Beta, and the primary [[Alpha Flight]] team.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #7 (Feb. 1984)</ref> Jaxon intended to form a personal [[Omega Flight|super-team]] to revenge on James MacDonald Hudson, founder of Department H and leader of the still-active Alpha Flight as [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|Guardian]], and Courtney was able to manipulate the already-disenfranchised recruits into seeking their own revenge on Alpha through an "influencer" device built into its systems.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #11 (June 1984)</ref> However, Courtney was unable to influence Roger Bochs (inventor of the [[Box (comics)|Box]] robot) who was still loyal to Hudson and the Flight program, forcing Jaxon to directly involve himself by taking control of Box.<ref name="AF12"/>

Luring James and [[Vindicator (comics)|Heather Hudson]] to America with an offer of employment at Roxxon's [[New York City]] holdings, Jaxon and Omega Flight executed an ambush of Guardian while Heather was detained by Courtney. When Heather made an attempt to escape and scuffled with Courtney, the robot's flesh-like facial covering was damaged and its true nature revealed. While Omega Flight's goal of revenge was attained with Guardian's apparent death, Courtney was witness to Jaxon's own death due to feedback from Box's destruction,<ref name="AF12"/> and Omega's remaining members were turned over to the New York City authorities.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #13 (Aug. 1984)</ref>

Escaping capture, Courtney freed Omega Flight from jail and employed the group in a new plot against Alpha Flight. Having its appearance reconfigured and incorporating facsimiles of Guardian's battle-suit technology into its systems, Courtney infiltrated Alpha Flight posing as Guardian and eventually lured the group into a second encounter with Omega Flight, using Alpha's trust of "Guardian" to ambush.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #25–27 (Aug.–Oct. 1985)</ref> However, Omega Flight's victory was foiled by the [[Beyonder]]'s arrival,<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #4 (Oct. 1985)</ref> and Courtney and its team were forced to flee.

Their escape was blocked by [[Madison Jeffries]], a former Flight trainee whom Courtney had avoided recruiting, fearing his ability to control machines and his loyalty to James. When Jeffries attacked with a construct created from an automobile, Courtney used one of the future duplicates of Omega Flight member [[Flashback (comics)|Flashback]] as a human shield, resulting in its death (and the mental breakdown of the original Flashback, now condemned to violent death in his future). This enraged Jeffries, who used his powers to destroy Courtney, forcing its internal circuitry out of its mouth.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #28 (Nov. 1985)</ref>

Bochs and Jeffries later salvaged portions of Courtney's second incarnation to construct a new battle-suit functionally identical to James's original,<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #31 (Feb. 1986)</ref> which was used by Heather under the Vindicator identity.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #32 (March 1986)</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
Delphine Courtney possessed superhuman strength, and had a high degree of resistance to physical damage. Its sight and hearing were sharper than a human being's. It also possessed a device called an "influencer" that could affect pre-existing psychological conditions in the human mind, allowing Courtney to manipulate individuals with judicious use of the influencer combined with verbal interaction; however, it could not absolutely control human beings, as Roger Bochs' loyalty to James Hudson allowed him to resist its manipulations. Courtney was also able to disguise itself as a human being with a flesh-like outer covering. It could masquerade as either [[gender]] by altering its underlying structure, and could even impersonate specific individuals convincingly enough to fool those close to the person imitated. While impersonating James Hudson/Guardian, Courtney also contained technology that could replicate the properties of Guardian's original battle-suits, granting it all of its identity theft victim's super-powers.

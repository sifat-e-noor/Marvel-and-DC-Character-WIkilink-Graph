'''Dr. Henry Jonathan''' "'''Hank'''" '''Pym''' ({{IPAc-en|'|p|ɪ|m}}) is a [[character (arts)|fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[penciller]] [[Jack Kirby]], editor-plotter [[Stan Lee]] and writer [[Larry Lieber]],<!--no confirmation of "Marvel Method" being used on pre-superhero Marvel monster stories, historical accounts of which refer to as having full scripts--> the character first appeared in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #27 (January 1962). The character, a scientist that debuted in a standalone [[science-fiction]] [[anthology]] story, returned several issues later as the original iteration of the [[superhero]] [[Ant-Man]] with the power to shrink to the size of an [[insect]]. Alongside his crime-fighting partner-wife [[Wasp (comics)|Janet van Dyne]], he goes on to assume other superhero identities, including the size-changing [[Giant-Man]] and [[Goliath (Marvel Comics)|Goliath]]; the insect-themed [[Yellowjacket (Marvel Comics)|Yellowjacket]]; and briefly the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]. He is a founding member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] superhero team as well as the creator of the robotic villain [[Ultron]].

Debuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], Hank Pym has since been featured in several Marvel-endorsed products such as [[animated films]], [[video game]]s, and [[television series]]. [[Michael Douglas]] plays the character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' (2015), ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]'' (2018) and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019), and is set to reprise the role in the film ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania]]'' (2023). Additionally, Douglas voiced alternate timeline versions in the [[Disney+]] animated series ''[[What If...? (TV series)|What If...?]]'' (2021).

==Publication history==

Hank Pym debuted in a seven-page solo cover story titled "The Man in the Ant Hill" (about a character who tests [[wikt:shrink|shrink]]ing technology on himself) in the [[science fiction]]/[[fantasy]] [[anthology]] ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #27 ([[cover date]] January 1962). The creative team was editor-plotter [[Stan Lee]], writer [[Larry Lieber]], [[penciller]] [[Jack Kirby]], and [[inker]] [[Dick Ayers]], with Lee stating in 2008: "I did one comic book called 'The Man in the Ant Hill' about a guy who shrunk down and there were ants or bees chasing him. That sold so well that I thought making him into a superhero might be fun."<ref>{{cite news | first=William | last=Keck | url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2008-06-22-marvel-magic_N.htm | title=Here come Marvel's 'Avengers,' and Stan Lee, Joe Simon weigh in | work=[[USA Today]] | date=22 June 2008 | access-date=6 July 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706080444/http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2008-06-22-marvel-magic_N.htm | archive-date=6 July 2008 | url-status=live }}</ref>

As a result, Pym was revived eight issues later as the costumed [[superhero]] '''Ant-Man''' who starred in the 13-page, the three-chapter story "Return of the Ant-Man/An Army of Ants/The Ant-Man's Revenge" in ''Tales to Astonish'' #35 (September 1962). The character's adventures became an ongoing feature in the title. Issue #44 (June 1963) featured the debut of his [[socialite]] girlfriend and laboratory assistant [[Wasp (comics)|Janet van Dyne]]. Janet adopted the costumed identity of the Wasp and co-starred in Pym's subsequent appearances in ''Tales to Astonish''. Wasp also on occasion acted as a framing-sequence host for backup stories in the title. In September 1963, Lee and Kirby created the superhero title ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'', and Ant-Man and Wasp were established in issue #1 as founding members of the team.

Decades later, Lee theorized as to why "Ant-Man never became one of our top sellers or had his own book," saying,

{{blockquote|I loved Ant-Man, but the stories were never really successful. In order for Ant-Man to be successful, he had to be drawn this small next to big things and you would be getting pictures that were visually interesting. The artists who drew him, no matter how much I kept reminding them, they kept forgetting that fact. They would draw him standing on a tabletop and they would draw a heroic-looking guy. I would say, 'Draw a matchbook cover next to him, so we see the difference in size.' But they kept forgetting. So when you would look at the panels, you thought you were looking at a normal guy wearing an underwear costume like all of them. It didn't have the interest.<ref>{{cite book | title = Stan Lee: Conversations |  editor-first = Jeff | editor-last = McLaughlin | publisher = [[University Press of Mississippi]] | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1578069859 | page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=zLmB3GprtboC&pg=PA186&dq=%22ant-Man+certainly+wasn't%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=RfiZUOT2GuH30gG4uYHgBQ&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22ant-Man%20certainly%20wasn't%22&f=false 186] }}</ref>}}

Pym began what would be a constant shifting of superhero identities in ''Tales to Astonish'', becoming the {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=mid|-tall}} '''Giant-Man''' in issue #49 (November 1963). Pym and van Dyne continued to costar in the title until issue #69 (July 1965), while simultaneously appearing in ''The Avengers'' until issue #15 (April 1965), after which the couple temporarily left the team.

Pym rejoined the Avengers and adopted the new identity '''Goliath''' in ''Avengers'' #28 (May 1966). Gradually falling to mental strain, he adopted the fourth superhero identity '''Yellowjacket''' in issue #59 (December 1968).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wells |first1=John |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1965-1969 |date=2014 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490557 |page=200}}</ref> Pym reappeared as Ant-Man in ''Avengers'' #93 (November 1971) and for issues #4–10 starred in the lead story of the first volume of ''[[Marvel Feature]]'' (July 1972{{spnd}}July 1973). During this run, he appeared in a redesigned costume with a [[Nail (fastener)|nail]] as a weapon.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cassell|first=Dewey |title=Marvel Feature|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=71|pages=15–17|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=April 2014|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> After appearing occasionally as Yellowjacket in the 1980s and battling mental and emotional issues, Pym would temporarily abandon his costumed persona. Pym joined the [[West Coast Avengers]] as a scientist and inventor in ''West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2, #21 (June 1987).<!--Vol. 1 was 1984 miniseries--> The character returned to the Avengers as Giant-Man in ''The Avengers'' vol. 3, #1 (February 1998). When the team disbanded after a series of tragedies, Pym, using the Yellowjacket persona again, took a leave of absence beginning with vol. 3, #85 (September 2004).<ref>The issue was alternately numbered #500 (of the first volume) in an anniversary return to the original series numbering.</ref>

Following the death of van Dyne, a grieving Pym took on yet another superhero identity as a new iteration of '''Wasp''', in tribute to the woman he had married and divorced by this time, in the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] publication ''[[Secret Invasion|Secret Invasion: Requiem]]'' (January 2009). Giant-Man appeared as a supporting character in ''[[Avengers Academy]]'' from issue #1 (August 2010) through its final issue #39 (January 2013).  Pym returned as the Wasp in the mini-series ''Ant-Man & The Wasp'' (January 2011) and also appeared as a regular character in the 2010-2013 ''Secret Avengers'' series from issue #22 (April 2012) through its final issue #37 (March 2013).

After ''Secret Avengers'', Pym joined the ''Avengers A.I.'' after beating his creation [[Ultron]]. Then he appeared in many comic books like ''Daredevil'' (Vol. 3 and 4) and the graphic novel ''Rage of Ultron''.

==Fictional character biography==
=== 1960s ===
[[Biochemist]] Dr. Henry "Hank" Pym discovers an unusual set of [[subatomic particles]] he labels "[[Pym particles]]". Entrapping these within two separate serums, he creates a size-altering formula and a reversal formula, testing them on himself. Reduced to the size of an insect, he becomes trapped in an [[anthill]] before he eventually escapes and uses the reversal formula to restore himself to his normal size. Deciding the serums are too dangerous to exist, he destroys them.<ref name="Origin">''Tales to Astonish'' #27 (January 1962). Marvel Comics.</ref> Shortly afterwards, he reconsiders his decision and recreates his serums. Pym's experience in the anthill inspires him to study ants, and he constructs a [[Cybernetics|cybernetic]] helmet that allows him to communicate with and control them. Pym designs a costume made of [[unstable molecules]] to prevent bites or scratches from the ants and reinvents himself as the superhero Ant-Man.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #35 (September 1962). Marvel Comics.</ref>

After several adventures, Pym is contacted by Dr. Vernon van Dyne asking for aid in contacting [[Extraterrestrial life|alien life]]. Pym refuses but is attracted to Vernon's [[socialite]] daughter Janet van Dyne. Vernon is subsequently killed by an alien criminal who teleports himself to Earth, and Janet soon asks for Pym's help in avenging Vernon's death. Pym reveals his secret identity to Janet and uses Pym particles to graft [[wasp]] wings beneath her shoulders, which appear when Janet shrinks. Janet assumes the alias of the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], and together they find and defeat Vernon's killer.<ref name="Tales to Astonish #44">''Tales To Astonish'' #44 (June 1963).

Marvel Comics.</ref> (In comics three decades later, a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] presents Pym as adopting the Giant-Man identity at that time out of feelings of inadequacy when compared to powerful teammates [[Iron Man]] and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].<ref>''Avengers Forever'' #1-12 (December 1998{{spnd}}February 2000).

Suffering from the chemicals' effects, he reappears at Avengers Mansion in the cocky new persona of Yellowjacket and claims to have disposed of Pym. Only the Wasp realizes that Yellowjacket is Pym. She takes advantage of his offer of [[marriage]]. Pym eventually recovers from the chemicals during a battle with the [[Circus of Crime]] at the wedding.<ref>''The Avengers'' #59-60 (December 1968{{spnd}}January 1969). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Left penniless, Pym is manipulated by an old foe, the presumed-dead [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Egghead]], who tricks Pym into stealing the national reserve of the metal [[adamantium]]. Pym is confronted by the Avengers and blamed for the theft, as Egghead erases all evidence of his own involvement. Pym, in turn, blames Egghead, a criminal still believed dead by the other Avengers.

=== 2000s ===
During the [[Avengers Forever|Destiny War]] between [[Kang the Conqueror]] and [[Immortus]], two versions of Hank Pym are drawn in: Giant-Man of the present and Yellowjacket immediately prior to his marriage to Janet van Dyne.<ref>''Avengers Forever'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Yellowjacket briefly betrays the team to Immortus and the powerful Time-Keepers try to create a timeline where he will not turn back into Pym,<ref>''Avengers Forever'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> but he rejects this decision in time to help his allies.<ref>''Avengers Forever'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref> Observing the final battle, [[Libra (Marvel Comics)|Libra]]—who brought the team together by using the Destiny Force to tap into his subconscious awareness of the cosmic balance—reflects that both Pyms were necessary so that Yellowjacket's betrayal could bring the team into the right position to attack the Time-Keepers, while Pym's presence as Giant-Man both provided a stable support and irritated Yellowjacket to provoke his own actions.<ref>''Avengers Forever'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Back in the present, an encounter with [[Kulan Gath]] results in Pym being split into his two personas of Pym and Yellowjacket, after a spell cast by Gath temporarily transforms Pym into a swashbuckler-style Yellowjacket, followed by the Yellowjacket persona manifesting a physical presence from the extradimensional bio-mass Pym uses to grow. Yellowjacket's stability deteriorates in a confrontation with [[Diablo (Marvel Comics)|Diablo]]. The two personalities are restored when the Wasp helps the two halves realize they need each other.<ref>''Avengers Annual'' 2001 (September 2001). Marvel Comics.</ref> Pym is eventually able to resolve his problems and adopts his Yellowjacket persona again.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 3, #41{{spnd}}55 (June 2001{{spnd}}August 2002). Marvel Comics.</ref>

After the events of the "[[Avengers Disassembled]]" storyline, Pym takes a leave of absence,<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 3, #85 (September 2004). Marvel Comics.</ref> and in the [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Avengers: Finale'', he and Janet leave for [[England]] to rekindle their relationship.<ref>''Avengers Finale'' #1 (November 2004). Marvel Comics.</ref>

As Yellowjacket, Pym is a central character in the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline, joining those heroes that support the [[Superhuman Registration Act]]. At the conclusion of the Civil War, Pym is named "Man of the Year" by ''[[Time Magazine|Time]]'' magazine for his role in freeing several captive anti-registration heroes.<ref>''Civil War'' #1-7 (June 2006{{spnd}}January 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref> Pym becomes one of the administrators at [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]], a U.S. military base in [[Stamford, Connecticut]], for the training of registered superheroes in the government program The Initiative.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #14 (August 2008). Marvel Comics.</ref> Pym and Janet's relationship fails, and Pym again begins a romantic relationship with teammate [[Tigra]].

Following the publication of ''Civil War'', Marvel's ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline uses [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s to present the then-current version of the character as an impostor who replaced the real Pym at some point in the books' fictional history prior to the events of ''Civil War''. This impostor is an extraterrestrial of the shape-shifting [[Skrull]] race participating in a covert invasion of Earth; Pym's experiences throughout the ''Civil War'' series and related series are retold in brief from the perspective of the impostor and its allies.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #15 (August 2008); ''Secret Invasion'' #1-8 (June 2008{{spnd}}January 2009).

The Tony Stark A.I. counters that the only reason the team failed as a family was because of Hank Pym's attack on Wasp. Outraged, Ultron Pym nearly attacks the other heroes, but Scott Lang is able to talk him down by arguing that Hank Pym remains his own inspiration.

As Ultron Pym is using Saiph as his base of operations and plans to unleash the Ultron Virus on a cosmic scale, Silver Surfer goes to look for Galactus. Even though Galactus is no longer a world-eater, Silver Surfer informs him of what is happening and asks for his help to stop Ultron Pym's plot.

During "The Ultron Agenda" arc, Ultron/Hank Pym returned to Earth with plans to merge robots with humans like how Hank Pym became merged with Ultron so that he can make the ultimate lifeform. In addition, he started to call this form "Ultron Pym." After testing it on some people and some experiments on Wonder Man and Vision, Ultron Pym planned to make a fusion of Jocasta and Wasp.

Learning about this and not wanting to risk proving Iron Man's point by having the atomic separator used on him, Ultron surrendered to Iron Man knowing that Hank is dead.<ref>''Tony Stark: Iron Man'' #19.

==Powers and abilities<!--'Pym particle', 'Pym Particle', 'Pym particles', and 'Pym Particles' redirect here-->==
{{More citations needed section|date=March 2015}}
{{In-universe|section|date=July 2020}}
Hank Pym is a scientific [[genius]] with [[PhD]]s in [[biochemistry]] and [[nanotechnology]] and expertise in the fields of [[quantum physics]], [[robotics]]/[[cybernetics]], [[artificial intelligence]], and [[entomology]]. Pym discovered the subatomic "'''Pym particles'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->" that enable mass to be shunted or gained from an alternate dimension, thereby changing the size of himself or other beings or objects.<ref name="Origin"/> Pym is the creator of the robot [[Ultron]], whom he created as an experiment after examining [[Dragon Man (comics)|Dragon Man]], showing his knack for AI and cybernetics.<ref name="Ultron" />

After constant experimentation with size-changing via ingested capsules and particle-filled gas, Pym is eventually able to change size at will,{{issue|date=May 2015}} and mentally generate Pym particles to change the sizes of other living beings or inanimate objects.{{issue|date=May 2015}} Pym retains his normal strength when "ant" size, and possesses greatly increased strength and stamina when in "giant" form, courtesy of the increased mass. Pym's costume is synthetic stretch fabric composed of [[unstable molecules]] and automatically adapts to his shifting sizes.

Pym also uses a cybernetic helmet he created for achieving rudimentary communication with ants and other higher order insects. As Yellowjacket, then later as Wasp, Pym wears artificial wings and has bio-blasters called "stingers" built into his gloves. He took up the Wasp mantle in memory of Janet, who was believed to be dead at the time.<ref name="Mighty Avengers' 2009"/>

Pym also carries a variety of weaponry, provisions, and scientific instruments, which are shrunken to the size of microchips and stored in the pockets of his uniform.<ref>''Beyond!'' #2 (2007)</ref> An experienced superhero, Pym is a skilled hand-to-hand fighter.  In his first appearance, he claimed to be a master of [[judo]],<ref name="Origin" /> is skilled in [[wrestling]]<ref>''Marvel Monsters: Monsters on the Prowl'' #1 (December 2005)</ref> and [[karate]]<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #62 (December 1964)</ref> and has since been seen in combat with opponents of both his own size and radically larger than himself (as a result of his size-changing abilities).

During his stay with the [[West Coast Avengers]], Pym constructed a one-man vehicle with artificial intelligence named Rover.<ref name=":0" /> Rover is able to communicate with Pym and is capable of flight and discharging energy and acid.

Back with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] main team, he built a second Rover, resembling an [[Avengers Quinjet]].{{issue|date=August 2017}}

After fusing with Ultron, he now contains all of his [[Ultron#Powers and abilities|creation's abilities]] when he is in control.<ref name="Rage"/>

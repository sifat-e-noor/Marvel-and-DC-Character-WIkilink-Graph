'''''Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos''''' was a comic book series created by [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Stan Lee]] and published by Marvel Comics from 1963 to 1981. The main character, Sgt. [[Nick Fury]], later became the leader of Marvel's super-spy agency, [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] The title also featured the [[Howling Commandos]], a [[character (arts)|fictional]] [[World War II]] unit that [[first appearance|first appeared]] in ''Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos'' #1 ([[cover date]]d May 1963).

==Publication history==
Stan Lee has described the series ''Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos'' as having come about due to a bet with his publisher, [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]] that the Lee-Kirby style could make a book sell even with the worst title Lee could devise.<ref>Ro, Ronin. ''Tales to Astonish: Jack Kirby, Stan Lee, and the American Comic Book Revolution'' (Bloomsbury USA, 2005 reissue {{ISBN|1-58234-566-X}}), p. 78:
{{blockquote|To this day, Stan claims that [the replacement for the canceled title ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]''] was the result of a bet between him and Goodman. As Stan tells, Goodman told him their books were selling because of buzzwords like ''Amazing'', ''Fantastic'', ''Mighty'', and ''Incredible''. Stan answered that the Lee-Kirby style was responsible ... and offered the following challenge: "I'll do a war book with the worst title I can come up with, but if it's done in the Marvel style, I bet it'll sell."}}</ref> Lee elaborated on that claim in a 2007 interview, responding to the suggestion that the series title did not necessarily seem bad:
{{blockquote|It did at the time. First of all, it was too long for a title &mdash; we didn't have any that were six words. And "Howling" was a long word, and "Commandos" was a long word. I got the name "Howling Commandos" because in the Army there was a group called the [[101st Airborne Division|Screaming Eagles]]. And I loved the sound of that. So I figured we'd have the Howling Commandos.<ref>Archive of [https://www.webcitation.org/5unr2TLup?url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/fanfare/fast-chat-stan-lee-1.620730 "Fast Chat: Stan Lee"]. ''[[Newsday]]'', April 1, 2007. Online version March 31, 2007.</ref>}} Comics-artist contemporary [[John Severin]] recalled in an interview conducted in the early 2000s that in the late 1950s, Kirby had approached him to be partners on a [[print syndication|syndicated]], [[newspaper]] [[comic strip]] "set in Europe during World War Two; the hero would be a tough, cigar-chomping sergeant with a squad of oddball GIs &mdash; sort of an adult ''[[Boy Commandos]]''",<ref>Ro, pp. 78-79</ref> referring to a 1940s wartime "kid gang" comics series Kirby had co-created for [[DC Comics]].

''Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos'' followed an elite special unit, the First Attack Squad, nicknamed the "Howling Commandos", which was stationed in a military base in [[England]] to fight missions primarily, but not exclusively, in the [[European theatre of World War II]].<!--Howlers fought in Okinawa and elsewhere; Izzy was imprisoned for several issues as a POW in Japan--> Under Captain "Happy Sam" Sawyer, Fury was the cigar-chomping [[non-commissioned officer|noncom]] who led the racially and ethnically integrated unit (racial integration was unusual for the then-segregated U.S. military, though possible in elite special forces units).<ref>Lovece, ''Nimbus'' #3, p. 4: "[T]he book was unlike most group comics in that the cast were not all [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]], but instead, a superb melting pot of various religions, races, colors, and creeds, an incredible challenge to do [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalistically]] yet inoffensively."</ref> Lee was obliged to send a memo to the color separator at the printing plant to confirm that the character [[Gabe Jones]] was [[African American]], after the character had appeared with [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] coloring in the first issue.<ref name=markalexander />

The series ran 167 issues (May 1963 - Dec. 1981), though with reprints alternating with new stories from issue #80 (Sept. 1970), and only in reprints after issue #120 (July 1974); at this point the formal [[copyright]]ed title in the [[Indicia (publishing)|indicia]], which had been simply ''Sgt. Fury'', was changed to match the [[trademark]]ed cover logo, ''Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos''.<ref name=gcd-sgtfury>[http://www.comics.org/series/7233/ ''Sgt. Fury''] (issues #1-120) at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref><ref name=gcd-howling>[http://www.comics.org/series/1575/ ''Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos''] (issues #121-167) at the Grand Comics Database</ref> Following seven issues by creators Lee and Kirby (who returned to collaborate on #13 and on the opening and closing pages of #18),<ref name=gcd-sgtfury /> [[penciller]] [[Dick Ayers]] began his long stint on what would be his signature series, penciling 95 issues, including two extra-length [[annual publication|annuals]].<ref>Lovece, ''Nimbus'' #3, p. 6</ref> [[John Severin]] later joined as inker, forming a long-running, award-winning team; he would, additionally, both pencil and ink issues #44-46. The series' only other pencilers came on one issue each by [[Tom Sutton]] (which Ayers said was "done that time I asked for a furlough and reassignment")<ref name=ayersnimbusp9>Ayers in Lovece, ''Nimbus'' #3, p. 9</ref> and [[Herb Trimpe]] ("They shuffled Trimpe and me around, [him] to ''Fury'' and [me] and Severin to ''[[Hulk|<nowiki>[</nowiki>The Incredible<nowiki>]</nowiki> Hulk]]''" Ayers recalled.)<ref name=ayersnimbusp9 />

[[Roy Thomas]] followed Lee as writer, himself followed by [[Gary Friedrich]], for whom this also became a signature series.<ref name=gcd>[http://www.comics.org/series/1575/ ''Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref> Ayers said in 1977, "Stan Lee left ''Fury'' first to Roy Thomas because the [[superhero]]es were gaining in popularity at that time it was best he concentrate on them", referring to the young Marvel's then growing line of superhero comics, such as ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' and ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]''. "I must admit I resented somewhat those superheroes taking Stan away from ''Fury''!<ref name=ayersnimbus>Ayers in Lovece, ''Nimbus'' #3, p. 7</ref>

Friedrich began as a co-scripter of issues #42-44 (May–July 1967). The Friedrich-Ayers-Severin team began in earnest, however, with #45 (Aug. 1967), the first of what would be several of the series' "The" stories: "The War Lover", a shaded exploration of a trigger-happy soldier and the line drawn, even in war, between killing and murder. Daring for the time, when majority public sentiment still supported the undeclared [[Vietnam War]], the story balanced present-day issues while demonstrating that even in what is referred to as "a [[just war theory|just war]]", a larger [[morality]] prevails. As one writer in the 1970s observed,

{{blockquote|...''Sgt. Fury'' #45 took a firm moralistic stance for the rest of the series by premiering what would become one of the most acclaimed series of stories in comics: the Gary Friedich "The" series, beginning with "The War Lover". ... Future stories in that fashion — all but one written by Friedrich — would center on what war could do to "The Assassin" (#51), the tragedy of a man turned hired liquidator, his family held hostage by [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s [[Gestapo]]; "The Informer" (#57), an observation on loyalty and trust, staged in a German [[prisoner of war|P.O.W.]] camp; "The Peacemonger" (#64) [about a World War II [[conscientious objector]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>; "The Deserter" (#75), an allusion to the real-life execution of Private [[Eddie Slovik]]; "The All-American" (#81), [[Al Kurzrok]]'s tale of a man [caught] between the twin microcosms of sport and war; and ultimately, "The Reporter" (#110), an account of a [[journalist]] faced with the [question of] when might a human life be forfeit? Many feel, also, that #46's tale, "They Also Serve", should be included ... for that story might as easily have been called "The Medic"....<ref>Lovece, ''Nimbus'' #3 p. 8</ref>}}

[[Image:SgtFury57.jpg|thumb|left|''Sgt. Fury'' #57 (Aug. 1968), featuring a Friedrich "The" story. Cover art by [[Dick Ayers]] & [[John Severin]].]]
At his best, Ayers' art in ''Sgt. Fury'' showed "a clear, forthright storyteller, excellent in medium close shots with a subtly out-of-focus background. He blended large panels with thin or small ones for movement, and often provided vast, [[CinemaScope|cinemascopic]] panoramas for his writers to work with.... [E]ven in a scene that would ordinarily be static you could feel his characters breathing."<ref name=nimbus3p7>Lovece, ''Nimbus'' #3, p. 7</ref> Inker Severin "took the art even further, laying dark, scratchy inks" that gave grit to Ayers' pencils.<ref name=nimbus3p7 /> Ayers himself "liked the results of John Severin's work on ''Sgt. Fury'' immensely", he said in 1977. "He added details beyond what I'd put in. He always seemed to go one step beyond."<ref name=ayersnimbus />

Friedrich continued through #83 (Jan. 1971), with the late part of this run having reprint issues alternating with new stories. He returned for the even-numbered issues from #94-114 (Jan. 1972 - Nov. 1973).<ref name=gcd-sgtfury />

''Sgt. Fury'' ran concurrently with two other, short-lived Marvel World War II series, ''[[Captain Savage and his Leatherneck Raiders|Capt.<!--sp abbreviated OK--> Savage and his Leatherneck Raiders]]'' (later titled ''Captain<!--spelled fully OK--> Savage and his Battlefield Raiders''), which lasted 19 issues from 1968–1970; and ''[[Combat Kelly and the Deadly Dozen]]'', which lasted nine issues from 1972-1973. The Howlers guest starred in #6 and #11 of the former series, and #4 of the latter.

Lee explained the series's transition to reprints: "... so much fan mail came in from readers who wanted more of ''Sgt. Fury'', but we didn't have time, I didn't have the men to draw it, I didn't have the time to write it, and we were busy with other things, so we just started re-printing the books, and strangely enough, the reprint versions of ''Sgt. Fury'' sold as well as the original ones had!"<ref>{{cite journal|last= Thomas|first= Roy|date= August 2011|title= Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Interview!|journal= [[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]|issue= 104| pages= 3–45|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> The final issue, #167 (Dec. 1981) reprinted the first issue.<ref name=gcd-howling />

Seven [[annual publication]]s appeared, the first titled ''Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos Special King Size Annual'' #1 (1965), and the remainder titled ''Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos King-Size Special'' #2-7 (1966 - Nov. 1971), with hyphen and sans "Annual". The final three contain reprints only, save for a 10-page framing sequence in #6. In annuals #1 and #3, the Howlers reunited for a special mission each in the [[Korean War]] and the [[Vietnam War]], respectively; annual #2 found them storming the beaches at [[Normandy]] on [[Normandy landings|D-Day]] in 1944, and annual #4 was a flashback to the [[Battle of the Bulge]].<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/1687/ ''Sgt. Fury Annual''] at the Grand Comics Database</ref>

One latter-day story was published in ''Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos'' #1 (July 2009), as the cover logo read; its copyright indicia read ''Sgt. Fury & His Howling Commandos One-Shot'' #1. The 32-page story, "[[Shotgun Opera]]", was by writer     [[Jesse Alexander]] and artist [[John Paul Leon]].<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/36666/ ''Sgt.

==Characters==
In addition to Fury, the elite special unit of [[United States Army Rangers|US Army Rangers]] nicknamed the Howling Commandos consisted of the following:

* '''[[Corporal]] [[Dum Dum Dugan|Timothy Aloysius Cadwallader "Dum Dum" Dugan]]''' - A former circus strongman, Dum Dum is Fury's good right hand. He occasionally refers to his wife ("ugh!") in [[Boston]] and his mother-in-law ("double ugh!") as reasons that he enlisted, preferring fighting Nazis to dealing with them.
* '''Private Isadore "Izzy" Cohen''' - The first demonstrably [[American Jews|Jewish American]] comic book hero. Izzy is a master mechanic.<ref name=markalexander>Alexander, Mark. [http://www.twomorrows.com/kirby/articles/24fury.html "Wah-Hoo!! Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos"], ''[[Jack Kirby Collector]]'' #24 (April 1999)</ref>
* '''[[Private (rank)|Private]] [[Gabe Jones|Gabriel Jones]]''' - An [[African American]] serving in an [[Racial integration|integrated]] unit. (The regular U.S. armed forces were not [[Executive Order 9981|in real-life integrated]] until after the war, in 1948. However, certain elite units were in other comic books.)<ref>In comic books, the [[DC Comics]] feature "[[Sgt. Rock]]", begun in the series ''[[Our Army at War]]'' in 1959, had earlier featured an African-American soldier, Jackie Johnson, in an integrated unit.</ref>
* '''Private Dino Manelli'''<ref>{{cite journal|author-link=Frank Lovece|last=Lovece|first=Frank|url=http://www.kenmeyerjr.com/fanzines/nimbus3.pdf|title=Fury Got His Gun|journal=Nimbus|issue=3|date=September 1977|page=5|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227162305/http://www.kenmeyerjr.com/fanzines/nimbus3.pdf|archive-date=February 27, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> - He is modeled after [[Dean Martin]]. A swashbuckling movie actor, born in Italy, Dino enlisted to give back to the country that gave him so much. He is fluent in both Italian and German.
* '''Private Robert "Rebel" Ralston''' - an ex-jockey from Kentucky Bluegrass country.
* '''Private [[Pinky Pinkerton|Percival "Pinky" Pinkerton]]''' - Loosely modeled after real life Commando and movie actor [[David Niven]], this [[United Kingdom|British]] soldier replaced Juniper in issue #8 (July 1964). 
* '''Private [[Junior Juniper|Jonathan "Junior" Juniper]]''' — In an unusual and daring move for comics at the time, Junior was killed in action after a few issues (#4, Nov. 1963). As one comics historian wrote in 1999, "Today that's no big deal but in 1963, comics heroes simply didn't die; not permanently, anyway. Suddenly, with the death of 'Junior' Juniper, the series acquired some real cachet. It now played like a true-life war drama where people got killed and never came back. You wondered who would be next."<ref name=markalexander />
* '''Private [[Eric Koenig]]''' - A defector from [[Nazi Germany]] who joined the squad in issue #27 (Feb. 1966).
* '''Private Jim Morita''' - Was an American of Japanese descent who served in the US army as a ranger during WWII. He joined a Nisei Squadron under the command of Capt. "Happy Sam" Sawyer and served with the Howling Commandos on several missions.
* '''Private Jacques "Frenchie" Dernier''' - Was a member of the French Resistance against the Nazi occupation during WWII.

==Fictional team history==
In issue #34 (Sept. 1966)<ref name=gcd /> it is shown that a young Nick Fury with his friend Red Hargrove, left their childhood neighborhood to pursue their dreams of adventure, eventually settling on a daring wing-walking aviation act. Their death-defying stunts caught the attention of [[Lieutenant]] [[Happy Sam Sawyer|Samuel "Happy Sam" Sawyer]] when Fury and Hargrove were training British [[Commando]]s in low-level parachuting. Sawyer was serving with the British Commandos in 1940 and underwent training by Fury.<ref name=markalexander /> Sawyer enlisted them for a special mission in the [[Netherlands]]. Nick and Red later joined the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], with Fury undergoing basic training under a Sergeant Bass at [[Fort Dix]] in [[New Jersey]]. Both Fury and Red were stationed at [[Schofield Barracks]], [[Oahu]], [[Hawaii]] when the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] attacked the base on December 7, 1941, and Red was among the many killed in the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].<ref name="bass">This paragraph per ''Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos'' #62 (Jan. 1969)</ref>

Sawyer recruited select [[United States Army Rangers|U.S. Army Rangers]] to his "Able" Company.  Sawyer assigned Fury the command of the First Attack Squad, nicknamed the "Howling Commandos". They and the Second Attack Squad (the "Maulers", led by Sgt. "Bull" McGiveney, with Cpl. "Ricketts" Johnson),<ref>The Maulers and McGiveney introduced in issues #7 (May 1964); Johnson introduced #33 (Aug. 1966)</ref> and, later, [[Jim Morita]]'s [[Nisei]] squad<ref>The unnamed squadron was newly created in its first appearance, ''Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos'' #38 (Jan. 1967). Per [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/moritajim.htm The Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Jim Morita], "Able Company was shown to have four attack squads in ''Sgt. Fury'' #11. Perhaps Morita's squad was the Fifth Attack Squad?"</ref> were stationed in a military base in [[England]] to fight specialized missions, primarily, but not exclusively, in the [[European theatre of World War II]], eventually going as far afield as the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre]], [[Africa]], and, once each, in the [[Middle East]] and on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Russian front]]. Fury fell in love with an English [[nursing|nurse]], Pamela Hawley, who died in a bombing raid of London before he could propose to her.<ref name=markalexander /><ref>Introduced in #4 (Nov. 1963), died in #18 (May 1965)</ref>

The Howling Commandos' earliest (but not first-published) assignment occurred in the autumn of 1942. They were to recover British [[aerospace engineering|rocket scientist]] Dr. MacMillan from a German military base in occupied [[Norway]]. Their success brought the attention of British [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]], who incorporated the unit into the [[British Army]], and given the title of "Commandos".

The Howlers fought against the likes of [[Germany|German]] General [[Erwin Rommel]] and inter-squad [[bigotry]], often in the same story. Antagonists included [[Baron Strucker]], [[Captain America]]'s nemeses [[Baron Zemo]] and the [[Red Skull]] ([[Adolf Hitler]]'s protégé), and other [[Axis powers|Axis]] villains. The Howlers encountered [[Office of Strategic Services]] agent Reed Richards (later [[Mister Fantastic]] of the [[Fantastic Four]]) in issue #3 (Sept. 1963), and fought alongside Captain America and [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|Bucky]] in #13 (Dec. 1964).

They reunited for missions in the [[Korean War]], where Fury received a field promotion to [[lieutenant]], and the [[Vietnam War]], each in a summer-[[annual publication|annual]] special, as well as at a present-day, fictional reunion gala in issue #100 (July 1972).

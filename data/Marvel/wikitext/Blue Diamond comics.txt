'''Blue Diamond''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], debuting under the company's 1940s forerunner, [[Timely Comics]]. The character was created in 1941 by Ben Thompson, who also drew the first comic book adventures of [[Ka-Zar (David Rand)|Ka-Zar the Great]] and [[Citizen V]] for Timely, as well as [[Masked Marvel (Centaur Publications)|the Masked Marvel]] for [[Centaur Publications]] and Dr. Frost for [[Crestwood Publications|Prize Comics]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Ben Thompson |url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/t/thompson_ben.htm |website=Lambiek Comiclopedia |access-date=11 April 2020}}</ref>

An unrelated [[supervillain]] called the Blue Diamond appears as an [[antagonist]] in Timely's ''[[Human Torch (android)|The Human Torch]]'' #11 (Spring 1943).

==Publication history==
The Blue Diamond first appeared in ''[[Daring Mystery Comics]]'' #7 (April 1941), published by Marvel's 1940s predecessor, [[Timely Comics]], during the period fans and historians call the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=19}}</ref> During that time, he appeared only in that issue and its subsequent, final issue, #8 (January 1942).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Benton |first1=Mike |title=Superhero Comics of the Golden Age: The Illustrated History |date=1992 |publisher=Taylor Publishing Company |location=Dallas |isbn=0-87833-808-X |url=https://archive.org/details/superherocomicso0000bent/page/160 |access-date=8 April 2020 |page=160}}</ref>

More than thirty years later, Marvel launched ''[[Invaders (comics)|The Invaders]]'' in 1975, an intentionally nostalgic comic featuring star characters from the Golden Age — [[Captain America]], [[Bucky Barnes]], [[Human Torch|the Human Torch]] and [[Namor|the Sub-Mariner]] — in [[World War II]]-era adventures. Writer and editor [[Roy Thomas]] wanted to expand the franchise, so he created the [[Liberty Legion]] with a group of second-string Golden Age heroes, including the Blue Diamond, along with [[Miss America (Madeline Joyce)|Miss America]], [[Whizzer (Robert Frank)|the Whizzer]], [[Jeffrey Mace|the Patriot]], [[Thin Man (comics)|the Thin Man]], [[Red Raven (Marvel Comics)|Red Raven]] and [[Jack Frost (Marvel Comics)|Jack Frost]].<ref name=BackIssue>{{cite journal |last1=Cassell |first1=Dewey |title=The Liberty Legion |journal=Back Issue |date=August 2018 |issue=106 |publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |pages=19–22}}</ref>

In a 2018 interview, Thomas said, "I played around a little bit with the Blue Diamond. I made him bigger and stronger. In the original comics, he's just a guy about the same size as everyone else, and I bulked him up to make him a little more unique for that series."<ref name=BackIssue/>

The Blue Diamond fought with the Legion for five stories in 1976. The team was introduced in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #29 and 30 (April and May 1976), as well as an issue of ''The Invaders'' and two issues of ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]''. The Liberty Legion returned for another four issues of ''The Invaders'' in 1978–1979, and then the team disappeared from the canvas. Thomas said that there were plans for a ''Liberty Legion'' series, but by that point, the sales figures on the ''Invaders'' comic were dropping, and Marvel decided against launching a spin-off.<ref name=BackIssue/> He returned in 1981 for a one-on-one team-up with the Thing in ''Marvel Two-in-One'' #79 (Sept 1981).

In the 2000s, the Blue Diamond returned in two issues of ''[[New Invaders]]'' (2004-2005), and ''[[Citizen V|Citizen V and V Battalion: The Everlasting]]'' #1 (March 2002). He also appears in flashbacks as a member of the [[Crazy Sues]] in ''All-Winners Squad: Band of Heroes'' (2011).<ref name=War>{{cite book |last1=Green |first1=Paul |title=Encyclopedia of Weird War Stories: Supernatural and Science Fiction Elements in Novels, Pulps, Comics, Film, Television, Games and Other Media |date=2017 |publisher=McFarland & Co |isbn=978-1476666723 |page=29}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Elton T. Morrow is an archaeologist who finds a mysterious blue diamond on an expedition to [[Antarctica]]. The diamond is a piece of the Lifestone Tree, which powers the alien Chosen Eight of Fate. A German sub attacks Morrow's ship on the way home and Morrow is the only survivor. An explosion shattered the diamond during the battle, forcing innumerable tiny diamond particles into Morrow's body.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nevins |first1=Jess |title=Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes |date=2013 |publisher=High Rock Press |isbn=978-1-61318-023-5 |page=31}}</ref> After he is rescued by a British ship, he finds that the shards of the diamond gave him diamond-hard skin, giving him superhuman strength and nigh-invulnerability.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mitchell |first1=Kurt |last2=Thomas |first2=Roy |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1940-1944 |date=2019 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490892 |page=67}}</ref> Dubbing himself the Blue Diamond, he battles [[Nazi]] spies during [[World War II]] as part of the [[Crazy Sues (comics)|Crazy Sues]].<ref>''All-Winners Squad: Band of Heroes'' #1</ref>

After spending years in retirement, the Blue Diamond returns to assist the [[Fantastic Four]]'s [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] against [[Star-Dancer|Shanga]], a crystal based alien. Shanga falls in love with Blue Diamond, and turns him into a living humanoid diamond creature as her consort.<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #79</ref> Morrow returns to Earth to join the new [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]].<ref>''Avengers/Invaders'' #12</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The strange blue diamond particles embedded in Blue Diamond's body have made his skin as strong as a diamond, giving him superhuman strength and nigh-invulnerability. After his body was altered by Shanga, Blue Diamond gains the power of flight and the ability to survive in the vacuum of space. The alterations to his body also reversed the effects of aging.

==Reception==
In ''Golden Age Daring Mystery Masterworks Vol. 2'', journalist and comics writer [[Will Murray]] describes the Blue Diamond as "an obvious attempt to imbue some of [[Superman]]'s strength and invulnerability to a lawsuit-proof character".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Murray |first1=Will |title=Marvel Masterworks: Golden Age Daring Mystery Masterworks Vol. 2 |date=2010 |publisher=Marvel Enterprises |isbn=978-0785133636 |chapter=Introduction}}</ref>

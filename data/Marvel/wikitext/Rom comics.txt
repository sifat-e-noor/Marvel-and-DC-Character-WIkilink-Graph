[[File:RomToy.jpg|thumb|right|The original ROM toy in packaging, as released by [[Parker Brothers]] in 1979]]

"Rom" was a toy co-created by Scott Dankman, Richard C. Levy, and Bryan L.

The toy was originally named [[COBOL]], after the programming language, but was later changed to ''Rom'', after [[Read-only memory|ROM]] (read-only memory), by Parker Brothers executives.<ref name= "Interview-McCoy" />

The toy set a precedent for the game publishing company, which up until that time had only ever produced [[board games]]. As this was a new venture for the company, and given that electronic toys were still very new, a decision was made to produce the figure as cheaply as possible. As a result, the final product had very few points of articulation, and twin red [[LED]]s served as Rom's eyes instead of the originally envisioned green, which were more expensive to produce.<ref name="Interview-McCoy">{{cite web |url= http://home.hiwaay.net/~lkseitz/comics/Rom/actionfig/mccoy.shtml|title= An Interview with Bing McCoy|first= Lee K.|last= Seitz|date= January 4, 2006|publisher= Rom, Spaceknight Revisted!|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130121144540/http://home.hiwaay.net/~lkseitz/comics/Rom/actionfig/mccoy.shtml|archive-date= January 21, 2013 |url-status= live|access-date= March 25, 2007}}</ref>

Rom was licensed to [[Palitoy]] in the United Kingdom to extend the "Space Adventurer" line of [[Action Man]], appearing in their 1980 catalog.
Ultimately, the toy failed and only sold 200,000 to 300,000 units in the US, with creator McCoy blaming the failure on poor packaging and marketing.<ref name="Interview-McCoy"/> Parker Brothers subsequently abandoned the line.

A new action figure of Rom was released for the 2017 [[San Diego Comic Con]] and at HasbroToyShop.com in limited quantities as part of the [[IDW Publishing|IDW]] [[Revolution (IDW Publishing)|Revolution]] set alongside figures of [[Jetfire (Transformers)|Jetfire]] (a repaint of the previously released Transformers Thrilling 30/Legends LG-07 Leader Class Jetfire figure), [[List of G.I.

==Publication history==
=== Marvel Comics ===
To build interest in the toy, Parker Brothers licensed the character to [[Marvel Comics]], which created a  comic book featuring Rom. The comic expanded on the premise that Rom was a [[cyborg]] and provided the character with an origin and personality, and established the character was firmly grounded in the Marvel Universe, having regular encounters with mainstream heroes and villains.<ref name= "Rom-1-75">{{gcdb series|id= 2516|title= ''Rom''}} and {{gcdb series|id= 2662|title= ''Rom Annual''}}</ref> Ironically the title outlasted the toy which it was created to support,<ref name=regrettable>{{cite book |last1=Morris |first1=Jon |title=The League of Regrettable Superheroes: Half Baked Heroes from Comic Book History |date=2015 |publisher=Quirk Books |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |isbn=978-1-59474-763-2 |pages=234–235}}</ref> with 75 issues and four Annuals (double-sized issues) published from December 1979 to February 1986.

The comic was written by [[Bill Mantlo]] and initially illustrated by artist [[Sal Buscema]].<ref>{{cite book|last = Sanderson|first = Peter|author-link = Peter Sanderson|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 191|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= Prolific writer Bill Mantlo and artist Sal Buscema created a Marvel comics series and a whole mythology around Parker Brothers' toy 'ROM'.}}</ref> Buscema stated in a 2010 interview, "I liked the character.

=== IDW Publishing ===
[[IDW Publishing]]  licensed the character from Parker Brothers' parent company, [[Hasbro]], and on May 7, 2016, released ''Rom'' #0 as part of [[Free Comic Book Day]].  The free issue served as a prologue to a new ongoing series which began in July 2016.<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 104631|title= ''Rom'' (IDW Publishing)}}</ref> Rom continued to be part of the [[Hasbro Comic Book Universe]] until 2018, following the ''[[Transformers: Unicron]]'' event.

On July 18, 2019, during [[San Diego Comic-Con]], IDW announced a new series titled ''[[Rom: Dire Wraiths]]'', which will be written by [[Chris Ryall]] and drawn by Luca Pizzari, Guy Dorian and [[Sal Buscema]].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.newsarama.com/46098-rom-returns-to-idw-with-dire-wraiths.html|title= Rom Returns to IDW with ''Dire Wraiths''|first= Chris|last= Arrant|date= July 18, 2019|website= Newsarama|archive-url= https://archive.today/20190828015339/https://www.newsarama.com/46098-rom-returns-to-idw-with-dire-wraiths.html|archive-date= August 28, 2019|url-status= live|df= mdy-all}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===Marvel Universe===

Shown in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], Rom was originally human in appearance, and belonged to a utopian society on the planet Galador. When the planet was threatened by the warlike Dire Wraiths, another technologically advanced race capable of [[Skrull]]-like shapeshifting, Galador's ruler, the Prime Director, called for volunteers to be transformed into [[cyborg]] warriors called "Spaceknights." Volunteers were promised that their "humanity" (the body parts removed to accommodate the armor) would be preserved and restored to them after the danger was over.

Rom was the first to volunteer, and was transformed into a large, silver humanoid that at first glance appeared to be totally robotic. Rom was given Galador's greatest weapon, the Neutralizer,  which on one setting could banish the Wraiths into the [[Limbo (Marvel Comics)|Limbo]] dimension forever. Inspired by his example, other Galadorians volunteered and eventually one thousand were transformed into Spaceknights—each with his or her own unique armor, powers and code names.<ref name="Rom">{{cite comic| writer= [[Bill Mantlo|Mantlo, Bill]]|penciller= [[Sal Buscema|Buscema, Sal]]|inker= Buscema, Sal|story= Arrival!|title= Rom|issue= 1|date= December 1979}}</ref> The Spaceknights succeeded in stopping the Dire Wraith invasion, although Rom decided to follow the remnants of the fleet back to their home planet, Wraithworld (which orbited a black sun). The Dire Wraiths panicked, and after a futile counter-attack, abandoned the planet and scattered throughout space.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker= [[Ian Akin|Akin, Ian]]; [[Brian Garvey (comics)|Garvey, Brian]]|story= To Save a Spaceknight!|title= Rom Annual|issue= 2|date= 1983}}</ref> Unable to stop Rom, the Dire Wraiths successfully used their sorcery to trick him into allowing their escape. Rom now felt responsible for spreading the Dire Wraiths' evil across the universe and swore he would not reclaim his humanity until all Dire Wraiths had been vanquished. Fellow Spaceknights, including comrades [[Starshine (comics)|Starshine]] and Terminator, adopted the same oath and left Galador.<ref name="Rom"/>

After 200 years in space, Rom arrived on Earth, landing near the fictional town of Clairton in West Virginia, United States. Rom befriended a local woman named Brandy Clark, who, after witnessing Rom deal with the Dire Wraiths, began to assist him in his mission. Those witnessing Rom's neutralizer could not see the Wraiths being banished to Limbo, leading Rom to be hunted for supposedly killing innocents.<ref name="Rom"/>

During his time on Earth, Rom fought and banished thousands of Dire Wraiths. The increasingly desperate Dire Wraiths created new foes for Rom, including Firefall, a fusion of human and Spaceknight;<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker= Buscema, Sal|story= The Fire, the Friend, and the Foe!|title= Rom|issue= 4|date= March 1980}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=130}}</ref> the sorcerous Hellhounds;<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker= Buscema, Sal|story= Dog Day Afternoon!|title= Rom|issue= 6|date= May 1980}}</ref> and robotic Watchwraiths.<ref>{{cite comic| writer=  Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker= Buscema, Sal|story= The Watchwraith!|title= Rom|issue= 16|date= March 1981}}</ref> Two of Rom's greatest foes were Hybrid<ref name="Rom17" /><ref name="Rom18" /><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker= [[Joe Sinnott|Sinnott, Joe]]|story= West Virginia REEL|title= Rom|issue= 31|date= June 1982}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer=  Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker= Sinnott, Joe|story= Choosing Sides|title= Rom|issue= 32|date= July 1982}}</ref> (the result of a union between Wraith and human), and Mentus (a suit of Spaceknight armor occupied by the dark side of the Prime Director's psyche).<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker= Sinnott, Joe|story= Galador!|title= Rom|issue= 25|date= December 1981}}</ref> Other opponents were more traditional and hailed from the Marvel Universe proper, such as the [[Mad Thinker]],<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker= Buscema, Sal|story= The Ultimate Android!|title= Rom|issue= 14|date= January 1981}}</ref> the [[Space Phantom]],<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker= Buscema, Sal|story= Limbo!|title= Rom|issue= 19|date= June 1981}}</ref> and [[Galactus]] and his then-herald [[Terrax]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker= Sinnott, Joe|story= Galactus!|title= Rom|issue= 26|date= January 1982}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker= Sinnott, Joe|story= Turnabout is Fair Play!|title= Rom|issue= 27|date= February 1982}}</ref> He encountered such heroes as the [[X-Men]],<ref name="Rom17">{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker=  Buscema, Sal|story= Hybrid!|title= Rom|issue= 17|date= April 1981}}</ref><ref name="Rom18">{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker= [[Al Milgrom|Milgrom, Al]]; [[Frank Giacoia|Giacoia, Frank]]; Buscema, Sal|story= And a Child Shall Deceive Them!|title= Rom|issue= 18|date= May 1981}}</ref> [[Luke Cage|Power Man]] and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]],<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Jo Duffy|Duffy, Mary Jo]]|penciller= [[Greg LaRocque|LaRocque, Greg]]|inker= [[Ricardo Villamonte|Villamonte, Ricardo]]|story= Wraith, Color Or Creed|title= [[Power Man and Iron Fist]]|issue= 73|date= September 1981}}</ref> the [[Fantastic Four]],<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker= Sinnott, Joe|story= The Thing from Outer Space!|title= Rom|issue= 23|date= October 1981}}</ref> [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]],<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker= Sinnott, Joe|story= No Place Like Home!|title= Rom|issue= 24|date= November 1981}}</ref> the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]],<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= [[Bob Hall (comics)|Hall, Bob]]|inker= [[Kevin Dzuban|Dzuban, Kevin]]|story= SSHSSS|title= [[Marvel Two-in-One]]|issue= 99|date= May 1983}}</ref> and the [[Hulk]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker= [[Gerry Talaoc|Talaoc, Gerry]]|story= To Kill or Cure!|title= [[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]|volume= 2|issue= 296|date= June 1984}}</ref> Rom was one of the many heroes transported into an arena in space for the Contest of Champions, though he was not chosen to participate.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Mark Gruenwald|Gruenwald, Mark]]; Mantlo, Bill; [[Steven Grant|Grant, Steven]]|penciller= [[John Romita Jr.|Romita Jr., John]]|inker= [[Pablo Marcos|Marcos, Pablo]]; [[Bob Layton|Layton, Bob]]|story= A Gathering of Heroes!|title= [[Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions]]|issue= 1|date= June 1982}}</ref>

Furthermore, they attacked [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s [[Helicarrier|mobile headquarters]] which gave Earth authorities clear evidence of the Dire Wraiths' existence and threat.

Rom plays an important role in the [[Hasbro Comic Book Universe]] by [[IDW Publishing]].

Two hundred years ago, '''Rom K'atsema''' lived an idyllic life with his brother and mothers on the peaceful planet Elonia, a world constantly protected by a powerful planet-wide shield that blocked debris and potential invaders. Rom studied geology at the Elonia University of Arts and Sciences, and befriended Livia and Fy-Laa. One day, the three of them investigated a mysterious meteor shower that had breached Elonia's shield and discovered that the explosive meteors were of Dire Wraith origin: weapons designed to penetrate the shield in advance of a potential Wraith invasion, and ultimately responsible for killing his family. When the Space Knights of the Solstar Order intervened, Rom learned that one of his mothers had been infected by a Wraith and transformed into one of their number. Vowing to avenge his family, Rom and his friends joined the Solstar Order as Space Knights.

On his first mission, Rom would be responsible for discovering Elonia's supply of Ore-12, a miraculous liquid metal capable of "bonding" with its wielder and becoming a permanent suit of armor. Realizing that this mysterious metal was the reason why the Dire Wraiths had attacked their world, the Solstar Order would go on to mine the rest of the ore and equip the rest of their Space Knights with the substance. Soon afterwards, Rom—now a full-fledged Space Knight—left Elonia, leaving behind a beacon in memory of his family. Over the next fifty years, Rom took part in a variety of battles against the Dire Wraiths, and participated in the massive battle that saw the Wraiths' current homeworld, within the Dark Nebula, destroyed. The Space Knights spent the next few years pursuing remnant Dire Wraith forces across backwater planets within Solstar territory.

When Rom arrived on Earth, he was misjudged as Cybertronian. He killed a Dire Wraith impersonating [[General Joseph Colton]], which later exposed the Wraith infiltration around Earth. In time, he gained new allies like the [[Micronauts (comics)|Micronauts]], and together, they stopped Baron Karza and the Presence (the Wraith goddess). When [[Unicron]] arrived, it destroyed Elonia, which caused Rom to learn more about the monster and its link to the Dire Wraiths' creation. When Unicron was destroyed thanks to [[Optimus Prime]]'s sacrifice, Rom and the surviving Elonians accepted Earth as their new homeworld, and Rom and Livia rekindled their previous relationship.

==Powers and abilities==
Rom's armor was composed of the Galadorian metal plandanium.  It is extremely durable, even able to stand up to [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine's]] [[adamantium]] claws. It was shown to be damaged from time to time, demonstrating that plandanium is not indestructible. The armor had self-repair capabilities, though it took several weeks to repair major damage. It provided him with superhuman strength, flight, and the ability to travel through [[outer space|space]] via backpack rockets. It allowed him to breathe in any [[atmosphere]] and survive in the vacuum of space. In Spaceknight form, Rom also did not need to eat or sleep. Controls near the torso allowed Rom to lower the armor's temperature to well below zero. The armor stored a "solar charge" that could be used as a weapon and could drain power sources by mere contact. It gave him the ability to summon three pieces of equipment stored in "subspace":
;'''Neutralizer''' :Rom's primary weapon, which is designed to banish Dire Wraiths to Limbo by opening a dimensional portal. Unfortunately, the process leaves considerable waste material (ash, etc.) that makes it appear to an uninformed observer that the weapon kills its target. This handheld weapon could fire energy beams that could be deadly at a high setting. It could also neutralize various forms of energy. The device was designed so that only Rom would be able to discharge it. The Dire Wraiths unsuccessfully explored the possibility of examining the weapon to find some means of returning its victims to the normal dimension. The mutant Wolverine once tried to use the weapon and received a numbing blast of energy feedback.<ref name="Rom18" /> Rom's Neutralizer would inspire a similar creation by the mutant [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] when the US government tasked him with constructing a weapon against the Wraith horde. Forge's neutralizer, for a time, cost [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] her mutant abilities.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Claremont, Chris|penciller= Romita Jr., John|inker= Green, Dan|story= Public Enemy!|title= The Uncanny X-Men|issue= 185|date= September 1984}}</ref>
;'''Analyzer''' :Allowed Rom to see shape-changing Dire Wraiths in their true form and could assess the energy and potential of any object/entity. It could be used on an item which represented a world, such as a globe, and would display lights corresponding to Dire Wraith infestations at that point on the planet. Unfortunately, the device resembles a handgun, and Dire Wraith imposters took advantage of this fact to fool others into thinking that Rom was attacking them. Rom once arranged for an ally to have the equivalent kind of vision, but the Dire Wraiths counteracted that by magically blocking his mind from recognizing that particular visual data. Regardless, Rom allowed [[SHIELD]] to examine the Analyzer in hopes of creating equivalent devices among the Spaceknight's human allies.
In the new "Rom" series by IDW, his energy Analyzer is represented as two red lenses mounted on his arms. The arms transform to reveal the lenses, which emit a red light when in operation.
;'''Universal Translator''' : Allowed Rom to instantly learn the language of any creature, irrespective of their origin. This device was used to scan and store printed information from an encyclopedia in Rom's [[memory bank]]s for future use. 
In the IDW series, the Translator is not a separate piece of equipment, but a function of Rom himself. When he first speaks, he uses an alien language before shifting to English, seemingly mid-sentence.

==Other versions==

As Marvel Comics no longer possesses the licensing rights to Rom from Parker Brothers, the character is not allowed to appear in his armored form. Marvel has found ways to work around this dilemma.
*In 2000, Marvel published a five-issue ''SpaceKnights'' series which featured a hero named Prince Tristan (codenamed "Liberator") in a redesigned version of Rom's armor.  He fought alongside other SpaceKnights named after some of the more popular ones from the original series.
*In the ''[[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)#Genis-Vell|Captain Marvel]]'' series featuring [[Genis-Vell]], Rick Jones was shown to own a toaster in the shape of Rom's helmet.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= David, Peter|penciller= [[ChrisCross]]|inker= [[Anibal Rodriguez (comics)|Rodriguez, Anibal]]|story= First Contact|title= [[Genis-Vell|Captain Marvel]]|volume= 3|issue= 1|date= January 2000}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= David, Peter|penciller= ChrisCross|inker= Rodriguez, Anibal|story= It's A Small Universe After All|title= Captain Marvel|volume= 3|issue= 6|date= June 2000}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= David, Peter|penciller= [[Leonard Kirk|Kirk, Leonard]]|inker= [[Robin Riggs|Riggs, Robin]]|story= Quiet Miracles|title= Captain Marvel|volume= 3|issue= 26|date= February 2002}}</ref>
*In the alternate world of [[Earth X]], Rom had been banished to [[Limbo (Marvel Comics)|Limbo]] and was battling against the  Dire Wraiths he had sent there. Rom was seen in human form wielding his Neutralizer and using his chest-plate as a shield. He was referred to only as "the Greatest Spaceknight."<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Alex Ross|Ross, Alex]]; [[Jim Krueger|Krueger, Jim]]|penciller= [[Doug Braithwaite|Braithwaite, Doug]]|inker= [[Bill Reinhold|Reinhold, Bill]]|title= [[Earth X#Universe X|Universe X]]|issue= 3|date= December 2000}}</ref>
*In ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #12.1, the super-villain group, The Intelligencia, was seen working with a 'spaceknight' that had actually been a vessel for [[Ultron]] in his digital form, which he proceeds to reconstruct into his own likeness.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Brian Michael Bendis|Bendis, Brian Michael]]|penciller= [[Bryan Hitch|Hitch, Bryan]]|inker= [[Paul Neary|Neary, Paul]]|story= Her name is Jessica Drew, Spider-Woman|title= The Avengers|volume= 4|issue= 12.1|date= June 2011}}</ref>

==Reprint omissions==
As of 2022, no reprints or collections of the Marvel series have been produced due to Marvel's loss of the rights to Rom and the appearance of many Marvel owned characters throughout the series. 

Legal issues regarding the reprinting of Rom guest appearances in other comics have led to complications. Brief cameos such as a holographic version of the character appearing as a distraction in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #187 have remained intact as have the Rom entries in the ''[[Essential Marvel]]'' trade paperbacks for the original ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' and its deluxe edition sequel. The cover of the ''Essential Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' removed Rom from the artwork used for the cover of the collection.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

Several appearances by Rom have been outright omitted from reprint editions. ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist]]'' #73, which featured Rom, was omitted from ''Essential Power Man and Iron Fist'' vol. 1, and similarly ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' #99 was omitted from ''Essential Marvel Two-in-One'' vol. 4, while ''The Incredible Hulk: Regression'' trade paperback features a heavily edited version of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' #296, removing Rom's entire appearance in the issue. Furthermore, ''Rom'' #72, which was a tie-in to the ''[[Secret Wars II]]'' series, was omitted from the ''Secret Wars II Omnibus''.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

In December 2015, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reported that [[Hasbro Studios]] (later folded into [[Entertainment One]] in 2019) and [[Paramount Pictures]] were producing a movie universe featuring Rom and a number of other licensed toy characters, including ''[[G.I.

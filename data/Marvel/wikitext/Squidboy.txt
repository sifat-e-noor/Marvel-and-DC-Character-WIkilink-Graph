==Fictional character biography==
Sammy Paré is a 10-year-old Canadian boy whose genetic mutation causes him to physically resemble a fish. The physical nature of his mutation causes his classmates to ridicule him. Sammy considers using a gun to shoot his tormentors, but before he can do so, he is visited by [[Professor X]] and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], who recruit him to enroll at the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning in New York. Beast and Professor X do this with full knowledge of the weapon Sammy is carrying around; he is convinced to give it up. Sammy, with his parents' approval, chooses to enroll at the school for mutants in order to pursue an education free from persecution.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #410 (Oct. 2002). Marvel Comics.</ref>

On the return trip to the Institute, Professor X takes a detour to Ireland to aid in an [[X-Men]] mission at Cassidy Keep. Sammy saves [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] (Cain Marko) from drowning in the ocean, which begins a friendship between the two. Cain subsequently reforms and becomes a surrogate father to Sammy, who also becomes friends with [[Carter Ghazikhanian]] and [[Icarus (comics)|Icarus]] from the [[New Mutants]].{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Sammy's mother eventually finds out about his relationship with Cain and calls upon the Canadian super-team [[Alpha Flight]] to bring the boy home. Sometime after Sammy's departure, Juggernaut suspects that Sammy's father Claude is physically abusing him. Cain, who suffered similar abuse at the hands of his own father, decides to visit Sammy to investigate. When he and [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]] arrive at Sammy's home in [[Vancouver]] they find the boy covered in bruises. Cain snaps and severely beats Claude, destroying the Paré home in the process. He is subdued by Alpha Flight.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #437-441, written by [[Chuck Austen]]. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Cain is subsequently incarcerated for violating his parole, Sammy's mother testifies on his behalf. After Juggernaut's release, Sammy returns to the Institute with his mother, who entertains the thought of a romantic relationship with Cain.<ref>''X-Men'' #161 (Sept. 2004). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, Juggernaut infiltrates the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]], working as a double agent for the X-Men. When Sammy stumbles upon a meeting of the group outside the school grounds, he assumes that Juggernaut betrayed the X-Men and lashes out at him. [[Black Tom Cassidy]] uses his control over plants to cause a group of vines to distort and crush Sammy's body mortally wounding him. With his last breath, Sammy tells Cain that he hates him for what he'd done. He then dies, causing Cain to snap again and attack the Brotherhood who were then subdued with the help of the other X-Men.<ref>''X-Men'' #163 (2005). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Although the Brotherhood is defeated, Cain feels responsible for Sammy's death. When Tom's humanity is restored after [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], he shows remorse for killing the child.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

The '''[[Brotherhood of Mutants]]''', also known as the '''Brotherhood of Evil Mutants''' and the '''Brotherhood''', is a team of [[comic book]] [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[supervillain]]s in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]] who are devoted to mutant superiority over normal humans. Their roster has varied and has included many powerful and dangerous mutants, and they have often been at odds with the [[X-Men]], although on rare occasions they have worked alongside them, usually in order to overcome some greater evil. The original Brotherhood first appeared in ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #4 (March 1964), and were created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

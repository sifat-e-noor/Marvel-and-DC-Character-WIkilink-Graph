'''Northstar''' ({{lang-fr|Étoile du Nord}}) ('''Jean-Paul Beaubier''') is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], the character first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #120 (April 1979) as a member of the [[Canadians|Canadian]] superhero team, [[Alpha Flight]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=199}}</ref>

Northstar is a member of a fictional subspecies of humanity known as [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]], who are born with superhuman abilities. The character possesses the ability to travel at superhuman speeds, fly, and project [[photonics|photonic]] energy blasts. His twin sister, [[Aurora (comics)|Aurora]], possesses similar abilities. Although the character was initially depicted as a member of Alpha Flight, he has appeared regularly as a member of the X-Men since joining the team of mutants in ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #414 (December 2002).

The character is one of the first openly [[homosexuality|gay]] superheroes in American comic books, and the first openly gay character to come out in a book published by Marvel Comics. He married his husband, Kyle Jinadu, in ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' #51 (June 2012), which was the first depiction of a [[same-sex wedding]] in mainstream comics.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Perpetua|first=Matthew|title=Marvel Comics Hosts First Gay Wedding in 'Astonishing X-Men'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/marvel-comics-hosts-first-gay-wedding-in-astonishing-x-men-20120522|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=May 22, 2012|access-date=September 6, 2017|archive-date=November 24, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151124202249/http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/marvel-comics-hosts-first-gay-wedding-in-astonishing-x-men-20120522|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Publication history==
===1979–1994===
Northstar debuted in ''The [[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #120 (April 1979) as part of the Canadian government sponsored team [[Alpha Flight]], who sought to take [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] of the X-Men into custody. In 1983, Alpha Flight went on to star in its own comic, with Northstar as a charter member. In addition to the ''Alpha Flight'' comic and associated annuals, Northstar and other members of the team made numerous guest appearances in other titles, particularly ''Uncanny X-Men'' and ''Wolverine''. Northstar was also featured in miniseries including two ''X-Men and Alpha Flight'' series and ''[[Secret Wars II]]''.

Creator [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] was reluctant to produce an initial run of the 1983 ''[[Alpha Flight (comic book)|Alpha Flight]]'' comic series for lack of developed and compelling characters. They had no back-stories and were created as nothing more than a team to face the X-Men. So in order to make the team less two-dimensional and more developed, Northstar's sexual orientation was subtly introduced into the start of the new ''Alpha Flight'' series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.byrnerobotics.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=20713 |work=Byrne Robotics |title=Jim Shooter's views on homosexuality in comics }}</ref> Although Byrne had intended the character to be gay, he was restricted to implied hints of this fact,<ref name="Byrne">{{cite web |last=Byrne |first=John |url=http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=2&T1=Questions+about+Comic+Book+Projects#106 |title=Frequently Asked Questions: Was NorthStar always intended to be a gay character? |publisher=Byrne Robotics |access-date=April 11, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126025406/http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=2&T1=Questions+about+Comic+Book+Projects#106 |archive-date=January 26, 2013 }}</ref> due to Marvel editor-in-chief [[Jim Shooter]]'s policy against openly homosexual characters,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bartilucci |first=Vinnie |title=One Thin Dime an' Two Thick Pennies (Jim Shooter interview) |journal=Thwack! }}</ref> and by the [[Comics Code Authority]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Nyberg |first=Amy Kiste |title=Seal of Approval: The History of the Comics Code |location=[[Jackson, Mississippi]] |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |year=1998 |pages=143, 175–176 |isbn=0-87805-975-X }}</ref> For example, in ''Alpha Flight'' #18, when Northstar's residence is called by Heather Hudson, a half-naked man in swim trunks who had been swimming with Northstar answers the phone, while in ''Alpha Flight'' #41, Northstar's sister Aurora says to her brother, "Since when do you object to having attractively-dressed men about, my brother?"

As the first major, openly gay character created by Marvel Comics, Northstar generated significant publicity in the mainstream press,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/24/opinion/the-comics-break-new-ground-again.html |title=Op-Ed: The Comics Break New Ground, Again |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 24, 1992 |access-date=April 11, 2009 }}</ref> and ''Alpha Flight'' #106 sold out in a week, although the series was not a very popular title.<ref name="Furey"/> It is the only comic book issue to have been inducted into the [[Gaylactic Spectrum Awards#Hall of Fame|Gaylactic Hall of Fame]].<ref name=locspec02>{{citation |url=http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/Spectrum22002.html |title=2002 Gaylactic Spectrum Awards |access-date=2008-11-13 |first=Mark R. |last=Kelly |year=2002 |publisher=Locus Publications |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115135857/http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/Spectrum22002.html |archive-date=2006-11-15 }}</ref> The event was also controversial,<ref>{{cite web |last=Masaki |first=Lyle |url=http://www.afterelton.com/blog/lylemasaki/seven-major-gay-moments-from-marvel-history |title=The Seven Biggest Gay Moments in Marvel Comics History |work=[[AfterElton.com]] |date=November 15, 2007 |access-date=April 11, 2009 }}</ref> and almost no mention was made of his sexual orientation for the remainder of the first ''Alpha Flight'' series, which ended with issue #130 in 1994. One exception was a subplot in which his sister Aurora—experiencing a [[Dissociative identity disorder|split personality]]—accepted his homosexuality in one personality, while rejecting it in the other. After the cancellation of ''Alpha Flight,'' Northstar appeared in his own miniseries, which uses his mutancy as allegory and sexuality as subtext{{efn|Multiple allusions are made to Northstar's social anxieties throughout the story that - despite using anti-mutant rhetoric common in X-Men comics - avoid the term "mutant" altogether, leaving room for interpretation. This is most evident in the final issue, wherein the antagonist explains his ultimate motive as a deep resentment for Northstar's "kind" & fear of society accepting them}}. Interactions between Northstar and other gay characters have been depicted, such as in a ''Marvel Swimsuit Special'', in which he is shown socializing with the gay [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]] member [[Hector (Pantheon)|Hector]].<ref>{{citation |last=Masaki |first=Lyle |title="Ultimate X-Men": Troubling turns for gay superheroes Colossus and Northstar |url=http://www.afterelton.com/blog/lylemasaki/utlimate-xmen-gay-colossus-northstar-gay-superheroes |work=[[AfterElton.com]] |access-date=2009-03-29}}</ref>

== Fictional character biography ==
{{Long plot|section|date=April 2012}}
Jean-Paul Beaubier is born to a [[French Canadian]] family in [[Montreal]]. After his parents die in an automobile accident during his childhood, he and his twin sister, [[Aurora (comics)|Jeanne-Marie]], are separated. Jean-Paul is adopted, but his adopted parents are killed after only a couple of years. Before his debut as a superhero, Beaubier competes as a professional skier (reaching elite level skier as a teenager, prior to his mutation surfacing). Once he develops his [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] abilities he becomes virtually unbeatable and eventually bores of the sport due to the lack of competition. He becomes an angry and rebellious youth. In young adulthood he joins the [[Front de libération du Québec]] (a [[militant]] separatist movement for [[Quebec]] from [[Canada]]) but soon becomes disgusted with, and renounces, the group's violent tactics. He learns of a superhero [[Features_of_the_Marvel_Universe#Government_agencies|group financed by the Canadian government]] called: "[[Alpha Flight]]". 

===Alpha Flight===
Jean-Paul joins Alpha Flight, adopting the codename Northstar. There he is reunited with his sister Jeanne-Marie (“Aurora”). Northstar's [[first appearance|comic debut]] occurs in ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #120, as a member of Alpha Flight fighting the [[X-Men]] to capture former teammate [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #120-121</ref> When Northstar meets his old friend Raymond Belmonde (a man who took him in and mentored him) he introduces Aurora to Belmonde, only for the twins to be attacked by local crime boss [[Deadly Ernest (comics)|Deadly Ernest]], who kills Belmonde. The twins deal with the villain, though their relationship sours when Northstar offends Aurora by asking if she had “romanced her way to safety". Aurora refuses to speak to him, and her lover and teammate [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] assists in a [[Superpower (ability)|power]] alteration, allowing her to generate light without Northstar. Her attempts to isolate him cause Northstar to quit Alpha Flight.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #1, 7, 8, 18</ref> Later, Aurora seeks him out & the twins begin to reconcile, but Aurora rejects him again after discovering his [[FLQ]] history. Alpha Flight cross-examine him about his FLQ activities, but are interrupted by an emergency.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #25</ref> When Sasquatch dies, the twins reconcile after Northstar comforts his grieving sister. However, during a confrontation with the [[Hulk]], Aurora discovers that her power alterations cause the twins to negate one another's abilities upon touching. After the battle, Northstar rejoins Alpha Flight.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #29</ref>

While on a skiing vacation, Northstar must expose his mutant powers to save a woman's life. Accused of using his powers to cheat in competition & realizing he could never know if he subconsciously had, he relinquishes his medals and bitterly turns his back on skiing.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #41</ref>

The villain [[Pestilence (comics)|Pestilence]] senses decay in Northstar's body and causes his sickness to grow serious to the point that his wounds no longer heal, slowly killing him. As his illness progresses, Aurora desperately uses her healing light to cure him.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #50</ref> The Asgardian [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] fools the Beaubier twins into believing that their mother was an elf from Asgard. When Aurora is thought lost in action, Northstar travels to Asgard (seeking this heritage) but is trapped there. Loki had sent a depowered Aurora to a [[convent]] (in an attempt to appease ''Those Who Sit Above In Shadow''). When a supernatural threat mobilizes Alpha Flight, the sorceress [[Talisman (Alpha Flight)|Talisman]] sends Aurora to Asgard to rescue Northstar. He shares the light with her, restoring their powers (allowing both to independently generate light).<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #85</ref>

During another battle, Northstar discovers an abandoned baby girl. Doctors discover that she is dying of [[AIDS]], after [[HIV]] infection in the womb. Jean-Paul adopts her and names her Joanne Beaubier. Alpha Flight perform various events to remind the public of AIDS and the dangers of silence about it. Her death weeks later spurs Northstar to publicly acknowledge his homosexuality, hoping that, as a gay celebrity, he can increase media attention on HIV/AIDS safety and prevention.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #106</ref> Eventually Northstar leaves Alpha Flight and writes a [[memoir]] about his experience as a mutant and gay man entitled ''Born Normal''.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #392</ref>

===X-Men===
In the 2001 "[[X-Men: Eve of Destruction|Eve of Destruction]]" story arc, Northstar is briefly recruited to an improvised team of X-Men by [[Jean Grey]] to rescue [[Professor X]], who has been captured by [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] and is being kept prisoner in [[Genosha]].<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #392 (2001)</ref> Jean meets Northstar at a book-signing appearance, where he is mobbed. One person in the crowd turns out to be carrying a gun. Northstar foils his own assassination attempt at super-speed. Later, he meets one of the new mutants, an invulnerable young man called "[[Omerta (comics)|Omerta]]", whose extreme [[homophobia]] leads to an actual fight between the two on X-Men's mansion driveway.{{issue|date=September 2011}}

At Professor Xavier's request, Northstar then works with the X-Men to save the life of a mutant child who cannot stop exploding. Despite his speed, Northstar cannot save the boy, who perishes simply because of his powers. Soon afterwards, Northstar officially joins the X-Men<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #414 (2002)</ref> and becomes an instructor at the Xavier Institute, teaching business, economics, [[French language|French]], and superpowered flight classes. Northstar becomes a mentor to his own squad of young mutants, [[Alpha Squadron (comics)|Alpha Squadron]], and forms a close mentor relationship with student [[Anole (comics)|Anole]]. During his time at Xavier's, he forms a close friendship with [[Annie Ghazikhanian]], a former nurse at the Xavier Institute. Annie realizes that Northstar has developed an attraction to [[Iceman (comics)|Bobby Drake]]. Bobby remains oblivious, despite Northstar, who was currently sick, saving him from the misguided anger of a jealous mutant.{{issue|date=September 2011}}

When [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] forms an alliance with the cults the [[Dawn of the White Light]] and the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]], the groups start recruiting new agents from the superhero community by killing, resurrecting, and brainwashing them. The X-Man [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] is one of their victims, brainwashed into becoming a HYDRA assassin. He eventually attacks the X-Men and kills Northstar. One of the [[New Mutants]], [[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]], manages to heal Northstar's wounds but is unable to revive him. A few days later a statue of Northstar is placed in a garden of statues of fallen X-Men on the campus grounds. [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] requests that Northstar be decapitated (to prevent [[resurrection]]) but his corpse is stolen by [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]], another brainwashed victim of HYDRA. A resurrected Northstar leads an attack with Elektra on the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier]], crippling S.H.I.E.L.D. and putting [[Nick Fury]] in critical condition. Northstar also takes the time to kill racists and homophobes all across the country, and uses his regained 'flash' ability to generate a brief blinding light. Wolverine meets Northstar, but is taken prisoner by the other Dawn of the White Light mutants, all of whom he kills except for Northstar. When Northstar refuses to tell Wolverine the location of HYDRA's command center, Wolverine knocks him out asks S.H.I.E.L.D. to psychologically "[[Deprogramming|deprogram]]" him.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #31</ref>

Not long afterward, the mysterious [[Children of the Vault]] abduct Northstar from the S.H.I.E.L.D. holding facility, to use him to kill [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] and the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #188</ref> They easily are able to control Northstar due to the Hand's previous mental manipulations. Under their control he finds his sister about to commit suicide and stops her so that The Children can mentally control her too. Together they attack the school under The Children's command and make quick work of several X-Men, notably [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and Anole, whose encounter with Northstar briefly shakes him from mind-control.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #190</ref> Leaving Aurora to battle the X-Men, Northstar begins a search for Sabretooth but is stopped by [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. The X-Men take Northstar and Aurora to the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier]] to try to fix their mental damage. Using their [[Virtual reality|V.R.]] equipment the X-Men allow the twins to relive their lives at an accelerated pace. The process is interrupted near the end of the session by [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]], creating a telepathic connection between the twins. Using each other's emotional support they apparently manage to face their inner turmoils. This gives both more control of their powers.<ref>''X-Men'' Annual #1 (2007)</ref>

=== X-Men split and reformation ===
<!-- [[Arcs: Divided We Stand, [[Secret Invasion]], Utopia]] -->
Northstar is contacted by [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] to find Anole (who is in hiding after accidentally attacking his own father due to [[Post-traumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] from his X-Mansion experiences). Northstar discovers Anole in a tree, the teenager not too happy to see his former mentor. Jean-Paul thinks Victor is having a problem with fitting in, as both a mutant and as a gay teen. Victor explains that his town accepts him for who he is – his problems come from Northstar, along with the other X-Men, for stealing the New X-Men's innocence. Just before departing, he elbows Jean-Paul in the face – similar to how Northstar attacked him in the past – and says that the New X-Men shouldn't look for him.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Northstar and his sister Aurora respond to [[Emma Frost]]'s telepathic [[All-points bulletin|APB]] and fight alongside the X-Men in San Francisco against the [[Skrull|Skrulls]] when they invade Earth.<ref>''Secret Invasion: X-Men'' #2</ref> However, Jean-Paul also makes a life for himself outside of superheroics, having returned to being a star at extreme snowsports, as well as starting his own brand of snow sporting equipment and becoming involved in a relationship. Wolverine approaches him to rejoin the X-Men as its [[speedster (fiction)|speedster]]. After confirming that he wouldn't be a [[Tokenism|token gay]] member, he accepts.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #508</ref> While training [[Surge (Marvel Comics)|Surge]] in super-speed, Northstar stops to give an interview, where he learns of [[Simon Trask]]'s Proposition X (a Mutant Breeding Act [[California ballot proposition|Ballot Initiative]]). He runs back to the X-Men and threatens to quit and go back to Canada. However, he remains with the X-Men throughout several missions,<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #511</ref> including confrontations with [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]'s [[Dark X-Men]]<ref>''Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men: Utopia'' #1</ref><ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #514</ref><ref>''Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men: Exodus'' #1</ref> and a rescue mission to retrieve [[Magik (comics)|Illyana Rasputin]] after she is banished to [[Limbo (Marvel Comics)|Limbo]] during the events of ''[[X-Men: Second Coming|Second Coming]]''.<ref>''X-Men: Second Coming - Revelations: Hellbound''</ref>

A temporal copy of Northstar—from shortly before the apparent death of [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|Guardian]] at the hands of [[Jerry Jaxon]]—was introduced near the end of the third ''Alpha Flight'' series, along with an entire team of early Alpha Flight members.{{issue|date=November 2010}} This Northstar is last seen with a similarly time-displaced Aurora, still operating in the [[Earth-616]] present.{{issue|date=November 2010}}

During the "[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]" storyline, Northstar alongside Aurora, Sasquatch, and Snowbird are reunited with a resurrected Guardian, [[Vindicator (comics)|Vindicator]], Shaman, and [[Marrina Smallwood]], and they reform [[Alpha Flight]].<ref>''Chaos War: Alpha Flight'' #1</ref>

== Powers and abilities ==
[[File:Northstar and Aurora.jpg|Northstar and Aurora. Art by Leinil Francis Yu.|200px|thumb]]

Northstar is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who can move and fly at superhuman speed with the potential of reaching near light speeds. He also possesses superhuman stamina, endurance (both essential to maintain super-speed for any length of time), and reflexes. He can channel a portion of the kinetic energy of the atomic motion in his body's molecules in a single direction, accelerating his body to a velocity in direct proportion to the amount of kinetic energy he has tapped. Northstar also has an advanced [[sense of balance|equilibrium]], and exceptional agility, reaction time, and coordination which allows for him to make sharp turns, and run at such speeds without becoming sick. Northstar is also able to punch at great speeds, which grants him the ability to hurt even the [[Hulk]]. In an early issue of Alpha Flight Northstar reveals to readers that his sister [[Aurora (comics)|Aurora]] has greater endurance and can fly longer, whereas he can fly faster in the same amount of time.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #1 (1983)</ref> Northstar can create cyclones by running in circles, can run up walls and across water, and can breathe while traveling at supersonic speeds. However, if Northstar wanted to travel with someone else at superhuman speeds, they would need a breathing apparatus to keep from asphyxiating.

As a side effect of partially robbing his molecules of their atomic motion, the binding forces within and between the molecules have increased, which enhances the sheer toughness of Northstar's entire body. This effect gives his skin enough durability to withstand speeds up to at least Mach 10 without injury, but the upper limit of this ability has not been measured.  It had once been theorized that Northstar could fly at 99% of the speed of light: {{convert|186282|mi/s|km/s}},{{Issue|date=January 2010}} although this has never been attempted because he would do irreparable damage to the environment.  While Northstar can withstand Mach 10 speeds, traveling any faster would carry complications with breathing and damage caused by wind and air resistance to his body. When Aurora, his sister, and Northstar are in contact with each other, usually by holding hands, they can also vary the rate of acceleration of his molecules to release a cascade of photons creating a momentary burst of light equal to one million [[candela]] which they use to blind their opponents. The only other minor drawback to this ability, other than he and his sister having to be in contact with each other to utilize this gift, is that they are unable to adjust the brilliance of the flash. After being captured by the Children of the Vault in the Supernovas arc of Mike Carey's ''X-Men'', his and Aurora's powers have been enhanced to the point where they can now move at light speed without harm and can generate explosive thermal energy in addition to light.<ref>''X-Men'' #189</ref><ref>''X-Men'' #190</ref>

Northstar is a world-class professional skier, skilled trapeze artist, business man, and an accomplished novelist.  A native French speaker, he is also fluent in English. He is a good hand-to-hand combatant using a style utilizing his superhuman speed, and received coaching from his teammate [[Puck (comics)|Puck]]. After his resurrection by the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]], Northstar has been trained in the martial arts.{{Issue|date=January 2010}} Northstar also has peak human strength, but has superhuman strength in his legs.

Northstar wears a costume of synthetic stretch fabric made of special materials for protection from friction and other hazards of superhuman speed.

==Other versions==

===Age of Apocalypse===
[[File:AoANorthstarAurora.png|thumb|right|Northstar and Aurora in the Age of Apocalypse. Art by [[Steve Epting]].]]

In the [[Age of Apocalypse]], Northstar and [[Aurora (comics)|Aurora]] are part of Mr. Sinister's Elite Mutant Force (E.M.F.) and, as such, are assigned to patrolling the breeding pens. The siblings are rather snotty about their superior status as mutants and seem to take great pleasure in punishing those prisoners who act up or try to escape. When the E.M.F.'s leader, Cyclops, switches sides, secretly helping some inmates to escape, he is caught in the act by the speeding twins.  However, both of them are defeated by Cyclops and the prisoner he was helping to escape, which happens to be [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Polaris]]. When the series was revisited for the 10 year anniversary, both Northstar and Aurora are later killed by Weapon X ([[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]) and Kirika ([[X-23]] in the main Marvel Universe).<ref>''X-Men: Age of Apocalypse'' #2</ref>

===Marvel Zombies===
In the [[Marvel Zombies]] comics set in the universe of Earth-2149, the zombified [[Alpha Flight]] attack the X-Men and are eventually killed by [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]. Northstar is seen in a panel of Marvel Zombies Dead Days attacking the X-Man [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] alongside his sister [[Aurora (comics)|Aurora]]. The two are killed by Magneto only moments later.

===Ultimate Marvel===<!-- This section is linked from [[Colossus (comics)]] -->
<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Ultnorth.PNG|Ultimate Northstar. Art by Stuart Immonen.|thumb|{{Deletable image-caption|1=Saturday, 29 December 2007|date=March 2012}}]] -->

In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] Universe, his features are similar to his original counterpart, although his ears are no longer pointed. He can also move at super-speed, though he has yet to demonstrate the ability to fly, or any abilities related to [[light emission]].

A student at [[New York City]]'s [[Stuyvesant High School]], Northstar is kicked off the school's track team for suspected [[ergogenic use of anabolic steroids|illegal steroid use]]. In fact, his unnatural levels of speed are actually due to his mutation.  When the X-Men reveal to him he is a mutant and ask him to join them, he turns them down, saying that separating themselves from humans is segregation and noting how a student there ([[Beast (comics)|Beast]]) had been recently killed.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #46</ref>

Soon after, [[Mister Sinister#Ultimate Marvel|Mister Sinister]], a deranged man who is apparently under orders of [[Alternative versions of Apocalypse#Ultimate Apocalypse|Apocalypse]] to kill ten mutants, shoots Northstar.  Thanks to his quick reflexes, Northstar manages to survive the attack but is left in a coma. After being hospitalized, he is awakened from his coma by the X-Man [[Jean Grey]]. Upon being told that [[Alternative versions of Colossus#Ultimate Colossus|Colossus]] had watched over him all night to protect him from any further attacks, Northstar asks if Colossus is single, startling Colossus so much that his body involuntarily turns to steel.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #47</ref>

Northstar is later recruited by [[Emma Frost#Ultimate Marvel|Emma Frost]] to join the [[New Mutants#Ultimate X-Men|Academy of Tomorrow]], a [[magnet school]] for gifted children both mutant and human with a more [[Pacifism|pacifistic]] and [[Racial integration|integrationist]] philosophy than the X-Men.{{issue|date=December 2010}} Along with fellow students [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Lorna Dane]] and [[Havok (comics)#Ultimate Havok|Alex Summers]], he completes Frost's Advanced Leadership Workshop, allowing him to make use of his powers performing off-campus community service missions in conjunction with local authorities.{{issue|date=December 2010}} When Lorna is framed for murder and imprisoned in the Triskelion (the headquarters of the [[Ultimates]]), in an elaborate scheme by [[Alternative versions of Magneto#Ultimate Marvel|Magneto]] to help him escape the prison, Northstar is part of the group of Frost's students who try to break her out.{{issue|date=December 2010}}  During a battle with the Ultimates and the X-Men, he shows that he has improved his abilities enough to move faster than the human eye (allowing him to attack without being seen), run across water (though a direct hit from a super-powered person could cause him to sink), and resist gravity (he is able to run up the side of a tall building).{{Issue|date=January 2010}}

During the battle he shows romantic interest in Colossus, and a week later it is revealed that the two have kept in contact, having exchanged email addresses. Colossus is shown on the phone talking to Northstar, who asks Colossus to be his date to his school's homecoming dance (which he accepts). But the dance is interrupted by the [[Brotherhood of Mutants#Ultimate Brotherhood|Brotherhood]]. After the supposed death of Charles Xavier, Colossus agrees to temporarily live with Northstar at his school.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}

During a softball game between the Academy of Tomorrow and the Xavier School, Ultimate Alpha Flight shows up to kidnap Northstar. [[Aurora (comics)#Ultimate Aurora|Aurora]] makes her debut, revealing herself to be Northstar's sister. She physically takes him against his will.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #94</ref> Later, Colossus, Cyclops, Rogue, [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]], [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]], and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] break into Alpha Flight's base to rescue him. After they incapacitate Alpha Flight, Colossus finds Northstar overdosing on the mutant drug, [[Mutant Growth Hormone#Ultimate Mutant Growth Hormone|Banshee]], resulting in him being crippled from the waist down.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #97</ref>

===''X-Men: The End''===
In the alternate future of ''[[X-Men: The End]]'', Northstar is one of many members of the staff of the Xavier Institute. He briefly survives the destruction of it and several surrounding miles, only to die in Scott Summers' arms. As he passes on, he sees a vision of his Alpha Flight friends, leading is his sister, who encourages him to leave his body.

===House of M===
In the alternate reality created by the [[Scarlet Witch]] known as [[House of M]], Northstar is an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., responsible for training a squad of young mutants and superhumans in the agency's junior training squad program.  Much like the rest of the super-powered community in House of M, Northstar supported this reality's Magneto and his mutant-supremacy platform.<ref>''New X-Men: Academy X'' # 16</ref>

==="Age of X"===
In the alternate timeline seen in the "[[Age of X]]" storyline, Jean-Paul was on the first team of Fortress X defenders to attack Kitty Pryde when she breached the barriers, while Jean-Paul wants revenge for his sister's murder.<ref>''X-Men Legacy'' #245</ref>

===What If?===

In What If Scott Summers and Jean Gray Got Married Sooner?, their leaving inspired the rest of the original X-Men to leave the X-Men as well and seek lives in the outside world. Professor X recruited Northstar as part of a new team, along with Aurora, Storm, Colossus and Catseye. This new team unfortunately died fighting the living island Krakoa. Sunfire and the Avengers defeated it, and found their bodies.{{issue|date=December 2017}}

In What If Wolverine was Leader of Alpha Flight?, Northstar was responsible for Wolverine staying in Canada after his capture by government forces. This story diverged from the story in X-Men 120–121, where Alpha Flight was assigned to capture Wolverine and return him to the service of Canada. As in the mainstream reality, the X-Men (Cyclops, Nightcrawler, Storm, Colossus, Banshee and their associate Colleen Wing) flew off, but here, Wolverine did not escape custody and slip aboard the plane. They circled back to attempt a rescue. The Canadian government tried to call Alpha Flight to handle things before they were forced into military intervention, but Northstar was on monitor duty and refused to take the call (presumably in anger that Cyclops had just beaten him in combat before Wolverine surrendered). Left with no other alternative, the Canadian military shot the X-Men down. None of them survived the crash. James McDonald Hudson learned what Northstar did and concealed it from Wolverine. Left without his new family, Wolverine chose to return to his first one: Alpha Flight. He led the team well, but Northstar was constantly nervous around Wolverine, fearing his wrath if he ever learned the truth. Wolverine did in fact learn- the team battled the Hellfire Club, and Jean Gray as Dark Phoenix revealed the truth. She wanted Wolverine to kill Northstar, but he killed her instead to free her. He forgave Northstar's role in the deaths of his friends and stayed on as leader of Alpha Flight. Northstar became a mainstay of the team once the threat of disembowelment no longer hung over him.{{issue|date=December 2017}}

==In other media==

===Television===
[[File:AnimatedNorthstar.jpg|thumb|left|Scene from the ''X-Men'' episode "Repo Man"]]
* Northstar appears in the ''[[X-Men: The Animated Series|X-Men]]'' episodes "Slave Island", "Repo Man", and the Phoenix Saga's "Child of Light" voiced by Rene Lemieux. No mention or hint is made of his sexual orientation. In the cartoon, Northstar possesses the ability to fly and generate a blinding light when he slaps hands with his sister Aurora. Though he did not have any speaking role in ''Slave Island'', the episode ''Repo Man'' showed the character's origins as he spoke with a French Canadian accent. In "Slave Island", Jean-Paul is a hostage/prisoner of the island nation of [[Genosha]]. He, along with many other mutants, provides slave labor for the government using their mutant skills for such tasks as building dams. They wear special collars which restrict them from using their powers to escape, and they sleep in prison-like cells. They eventually escape Genosha with the help of the X-Men. In "Repo Man", Northstar is shown as part of the Canadian Special Forces team Alpha Flight, which tries to convince former member Wolverine to rejoin. Northstar and other Alpha Flight members make a brief cameo in "Child of Light".
* Northstar is briefly mentioned in the episode "This Forest Green" of the [[animated series]] ''[[Super Hero Squad Show]]''.

===Video games===
* Northstar appears in ''[[X-Men: Destiny]]'', voiced by [[Yuri Lowenthal]]. The player character on the X-Men's side encounters Northstar during a mission to escort a courier to Gambit and protect him from the [[Purifiers (Marvel Comics)|Purifiers]].

Snowbird and Puck were packaged together while Sasquatch came with Vindicator (Heather Hudson). All three sets came with motion collector's cards.

In September 2007, [[Hasbro]] ran a poll with [[ToyFare]] magazine of potential Marvel Legends X-Men prototype figurines, one of which was Northstar in his original costume. Aurora was also a prototype.<ref>''ToyFare'' #124</ref> The Northstar prototype placed 7th out of 8 in the final poll results, with Aurora placing 8th.<ref>''ToyFare'' #128</ref>

A two-pack set of mini-busts of Aurora and Northstar were due for shipment in October 2008.<ref>http://www.wizarduniverse.com/jul084888.html{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}</ref>

Marvel Legends released a figure of Northstar as part of an Alpha Flight boxset in 2019.

==Reception==
The issue of ''[[Alpha Flight (comic book)|Alpha Flight]]'' in which Northstar came out was hugely popular. ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine reported that a store on [[Bleecker Street]] in [[New York City]] resorted to making customers who wanted to buy a copy of it to purchase a second comic as well. Later, they changed the policy to require that everyone who bought a copy had to buy an issue of the series ''[[The Punisher War Zone (1992 series)|The Punisher War Zone]]'' as well. The store claimed they did this to prevent hoarding of the comic. The policy was in effect for thirty minutes until the store was all sold out. In the end they received only one complaint.<ref>{{cite web |title=Comic Store Policy No Laughing Matter |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=FuQCAAAAMBAJ&q=Punisher+War+zone+1992&pg=PA10|magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|page=10|date=February 10, 1992|access-date=March 18, 2017}}</ref>

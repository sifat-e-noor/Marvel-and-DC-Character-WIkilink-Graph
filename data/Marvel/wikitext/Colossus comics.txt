'''Colossus''' ('''Piotr''' "'''Peter'''" '''Nikolayevich Rasputin''') ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Пётр Николаевич Распутин) is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer [[Len Wein]] and artist [[Dave Cockrum]], he first appeared in ''[[Giant-Size X-Men]]'' #1 (May [[1975 in comics|1975]]).

A [[Russia]]n [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], he is a member of the [[X-Men]]. Colossus is able to transform himself into metallic form, making him the physically strongest of the team. Even when his powers are not engaged, he is still a physically imposing figure of {{convert|6|ft|7|in|cm|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} in height. He is portrayed as quiet, honest, and virtuous. He has had a fairly consistent presence in X-Men-related [[comic book]]s since his debut. A talented artist, he only reluctantly agrees to use his powers in combat, feeling it is his responsibility to use his abilities for the betterment of human- and mutant-kind.

''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' ranked Colossus at 184 on the "Top 200 Comic Book Characters of All Time".<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.wizarduniverse.com/051308top200characters2.html| website= WizardUniverse.com| date= May 13, 2008| title= The 200 Greatest Comic Book Characters Of All Time, Part 2| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080603030126/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/051308top200characters2.html| archive-date= June 3, 2008| access-date= March 22, 2016}}</ref> In 2006, [[IGN]] placed Colossus in the 10th spot of their list of "The Top 25 X-Men".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/05/15/the-top-25-x-men?page=4 | title=The Top 25 X-Men | date=May 15, 2006 | work=IGN | publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] | access-date=July 28, 2015}}</ref> In 2013, [[ComicsAlliance]] ranked Colossus as #22 on their list of the "50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics".<ref>{{cite news|last=Wheeler |first=Andrew |url=http://comicsalliance.com/comics-sexiest-male-characters |title=ComicsAlliance Presents The 50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics |work=[[ComicsAlliance]] |date=2013-02-14 |access-date=2015-07-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018024021/http://comicsalliance.com/comics-sexiest-male-characters |archive-date=2015-10-18 }}</ref>

In film, Donald MacKinnon portrayed a cameo as Colossus in ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]].'' Actor [[Daniel Cudmore]] took over the role of Colossus in ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'' (2003), ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' (2006) and ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' (2014), and [[Stefan Kapičić]] provides the voice of a [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] character in ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]'' (2016) and ''[[Deadpool 2]]'' (2018).

==Concept and creation==
Editor [[Roy Thomas]], in charge of reviving the X-Men for ''[[Giant-Size X-Men]]'' #1 (May [[1975 in comics|1975]]), told the creative team to go home and create some characters for the new team. [[Dave Cockrum]] recalled:<blockquote>
I just went home and Colossus was one of the first ones that came to mind. We needed a strong guy for the team, so I drew up a strong guy. The character's armor just kind of fell into place. He was accepted pretty much as-is, except that I had given him bare legs because it seemed only logical that if we're going to show him armored up, the legs should be bare like the arms. But [[Len Wein]] didn't like male characters with bare legs. So we decided that his costume would be blue when he wasn't armored up, and that we'd see his legs when he was armored up, due to the [[unstable molecules]] of his costume.<ref name="TyphoonDave">{{cite news | last = Meth | first= Clifford | date = August 1993 | title = How a Typhoon Blew in Success | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]: X-Men Turn Thirty | pages = 50–52}}</ref></blockquote>

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=September 2008}}
A mainstay of the X-Men comic book series until the 1990s, Colossus went on to appear regularly in the first series of ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]''. While a member of the team, he had his own self-titled one-shot that depicted him and his teammate [[Meggan (character)|Meggan]] battling [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] at his new Murderworld facility.

After returning to the X-Men alongside Excalibur teammates [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]] and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], Colossus stayed with the title until his death. He was later resurrected and was a regular in the third series of ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' written by [[Joss Whedon]]. He is the feature of a limited series, ''Colossus: Bloodlines'', in which he journeys back to Russia. Colossus has since returned as a regular in the X-Men series, appearing in various titles such as ''[[X-Men: Manifest Destiny]]'', ''[[Secret Invasion|X-Men: Secret Invasion]]'', ''[[X-Men (vol. 3)|X-Men]]'', and ''Astonishing X-Men''.

Colossus appears in ''[[Cable and X-Force]]'', a new series by writer Dennis Hopeless and artist [[Salvador Larroca]] which debuted in Dec. 2012.<ref name="Cable&X-Force">{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=40999 |title=EXCLUSIVE: The Future is Hopeless for "Cable and X-Force" |last=Richards |first=Dave |date=14 September 2012 |website=Comic Book Resources |access-date= 14 September 2012}}</ref> He appears in ''[[Extraordinary X-Men]]'', written by Jeff Lemire and drawn by Humberto Ramos. He is part of a team which is led by Storm, and includes his sister [[Magik (Illyana Rasputin)|Magik]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], a teenaged version of [[Jean Grey]], Nightcrawler, a re-purposed [[Sentinel (Marvel Comics)|Sentinel]] named Cerebra, and [[Old Man Logan]].

==Fictional character biography==

===Background===
[[File:Piotr Saving Sister.jpg|thumb|250px|Colossus' first appearance from ''[[Giant-Size X-Men]]'' #1 (May 1975); art by [[Dave Cockrum]]]]
Piotr "Peter" Rasputin was born on a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Collective farming|collective farm]] called the [[Ust-Ordynsky]] Collective near [[Lake Baikal]] in [[Siberia]]. He lived there with his mother Alexandra, father Nikolai, and sister [[Magik (Illyana Rasputin)|Illyana]]. His older brother, [[Mikhail Rasputin|Mikhail]], had been a Soviet [[Astronaut|cosmonaut]] and had apparently died in a rocket accident. The 2006 comic mini-series ''Colossus: Bloodline'' established that the family was descended from [[Grigori Rasputin]].

Peter's superhuman powers manifested during his adolescence while saving his sister from a runaway tractor. He was then contacted by [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]], founder of the X-Men.<ref name="debut"/>

===X-Men===
Peter Rasputin was part of the second generation of X-Men, formed by Charles Xavier to save the original X-Men from the living island [[Krakoa]]. He agreed to leave the farm community where he was born to go to the United States with Xavier. Xavier gave him the name Colossus. After the battle was won, Colossus remained in the U.S. with the new X-Men.<ref name="debut">''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1</ref>

[[File:Colossus Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 19.png|thumbnail|upright|Colossus in his non-metallic form. From ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' vol. 3 #19 (Feb. 2007); art by John Cassaday]]
Colossus is typically portrayed as peaceful, selfless, reluctant to hurt or kill, and often putting himself in danger to protect others. In some of his earliest missions, he battled the [[Shi'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (Marvel Comics)|Imperial Guard]],<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #107</ref> and visited the [[Savage Land]],<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #114</ref> where he met Nereel.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #115</ref>

Peter's family always remained in his thoughts and he frequently wrote letters home. Shortly after joining the X-Men, a woman known as [[Miss Locke]] kidnapped many of the team's loved ones to force the X-Men to help her free her employer, [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]], from captivity by one of [[Doctor Doom]]'s robots. Among her captives was Colossus' younger sister Illyana, whom Locke had kidnapped from the Siberian collective farm and transported to the United States. Arcade brainwashed Colossus into becoming "The Proletarian", who then battled the other X-Men until they countered the brainwashing.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #123–124</ref> The X-Men freed Illyana from captivity, and she went to live with her brother Peter at [[X-Mansion|Xavier's mansion]]. She was later held captive in a dimension known as [[Otherplace|Limbo]], where she spent years while only mere moments elapsed on Earth, and became the adolescent sorceress Magik. As a result, an alternate-timeline version of Colossus dies in Limbo.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #160</ref>

When the X-Men fought the evil mutant [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|Proteus]], Colossus attempted to kill Proteus, an act he found morally questionable even though he did it to save [[Moira MacTaggert]]'s life.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #128–129</ref> During his early career with the X-Men, Peter started what was arguably his most significant relationship with fellow X-Man [[Kitty Pryde]].<ref>they met in ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #129</ref> Although they were only a couple for a short while, the relationship provided the foundation of a deep and lasting friendship.

Colossus was later almost killed in a battle with [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]'s [[Brotherhood of Mutants]], but was saved by [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlock]] [[Healer (comics)|Healer]].<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #177–179</ref> During the [[Secret Wars]], he became infatuated with the alien healer Zsaji,<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes Secret Wars'' #5–12</ref> and realized his feelings for his teammate were not wholly genuine, ending his relationship with Kitty Pryde.<ref name="KitBreakup"/> Emotionally distraught, he afterwards engaged in a bar fight with [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]].<ref name="KitBreakup">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #183</ref>

During the [[Mutant Massacre]], Colossus became heavily involved in the X-Men's efforts to save the Morlocks from the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]. When Kitty was severely injured by [[Harpoon (comics)|Harpoon]], Peter gave in to his rage and snapped [[Riptide (comics)|Riptide]]'s neck.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #211</ref> He eventually passed out from previous wounds inflicted by Riptide. [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], with the aid of Shadowcat, used his powers to heal Peter's armored form, but the process left him paralyzed. He was sent to Muir Island to recuperate, along with Nightcrawler, Shadowcat, and the surviving Morlocks.

Over time, Colossus' wounds healed, but he was trapped in his armored form and could maintain his human form only with the utmost concentration. When he saw the X-Men in Dallas during the ''[[Fall of the Mutants]]'', he had his sister teleport him to the battle, as [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]] had not seen him in her vision of the X-Men's demise. When the team decided to sacrifice themselves to stop the Adversary, Colossus gave his life alongside them to save the world. Like the rest of the X-Men, he was revived by Roma and decided to let the world believe him dead while he and the X-Men worked out of an Australian base.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #227</ref>

Following the ''[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]'' event, Illyana was returned to her original Earth age.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #73</ref> Colossus decided it would be better for Illyana if she went back to live with their parents in Russia.

In time, Colossus was reunited with Nereel in the Savage Land, and met her son.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' Annual #12</ref>

After the X-Men began falling apart with [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] vanishing, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] taking off, [[Longshot (Marvel Comics)|Longshot]] quitting, and Storm apparently killed, [[Betsy Braddock|Psylocke]] telepathically prodded the remaining three to disband and travel through the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]] to gain new lives.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #231</ref> Peter emerged in New York with no memory of his past life, inventing a new persona for himself as 'Peter Nicholas', where he quickly became a successful artist. He battled the [[Genosha]]n Magistrates.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #259</ref> He began having visions of a beautiful model, who turned out to be [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]] transformed by [[Masque (comics)|Masque]]. The two were kidnapped by the Morlocks, though Peter had no memory of his time with the X-Men.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #262</ref> He resumed his armored form and defeated Masque.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #263</ref> He was saved by [[Forge (comics)|Forge]], [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], and [[Jean Grey]], who decided it better that he live his new life rather than be dragged back into theirs.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #264</ref>

Peter was psychically dominated by the [[Shadow King]] and sent to hunt down [[Stevie Hunter]] and Charles Xavier.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #277</ref> Xavier had no choice but to destroy the Peter Nicholas persona to break the Shadow King's hold.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #279</ref> Colossus joined in the battle of Muir Island, and rejoined the X-Men as a member of Storm's Gold Strike Force.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #280</ref> Peter is shown to be traveling to the Savage Land, where he locates Nereel. He is astonished to learn that the child she bore was not his, but that of another lover. Disheartened, he departs the Savage Land.{{issue|date=November 2011}}

The X-Men later found themselves in another dimension, where they discovered that Colossus' brother, Mikhail, was alive and acting as a [[messiah]] to the population of that world.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #285</ref> Mikhail returned to Earth with the X-Men, but was distraught with having been responsible for the deaths of the original crew from his first trek into the other dimension.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #284-286</ref>

Mikhail established himself as leader of the Morlocks and planned to use them as a part of his mass suicide which he thought would grant him retribution or at least reprieve from his guilt.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #291-293</ref> This would prove to be a great source of grief for Peter in an upcoming string of family deaths that would lead to him temporarily disbanding from the X-Men.<ref name=autogenerated10>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #304</ref>

However, unbeknownst to the X-Men, Mikhail survived. In a seemingly last second change of mind, Mikhail transported himself and the Morlocks to another world.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #325</ref> Later, upon learning this, Peter was disappointed by his brother's departure and blamed himself.{{issue|date=August 2016}}

Back in Siberia, Peter's parents were slain and Illyana kidnapped by the Russian government, who hoped to genetically evolve Illyana to the point where she would have the use of her powers again, to defeat the mutant known as the [[Soul Skinner]]. Colossus, with the help of the X-Men, saved Illyana and brought her back to the Mansion.<ref>''X-Men'' #17-19 (1992)</ref>

Later, Illyana became an early victim of the [[Legacy Virus]] and died from it.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #303 (Aug. 1993)</ref> The loss of his immediate family, as well as brain damage that forced him to remain in armored form, caused Colossus to rethink his position with the X-Men and join [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] and his [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]], who had offered him an alternative to the X-Men's [[Pacifism|pacifist]] philosophy of peaceful mutant/human coexistence.<ref name=autogenerated10/> Colossus recovered from the brain damage soon after,<ref>''Excalibur'' #71</ref> but decided to remain with the Acolytes of his own volition, hoping he could temper their extremist methods with what he had learned from Professor Xavier.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #315 (Aug. 1994)</ref>

===Excalibur===
His stay with Magneto was not long once he realized that [[Providence (comics)|Avalon]] was not the place for him, either, particularly after Magneto was left brain-dead and the space station was destroyed by [[Holocaust (Marvel Comics)|Holocaust]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} He left in search of the only person he felt truly cared for him, his former love and teammate [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]], now a member of [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]. Colossus traveled to England, where he found Kitty in the arms of her new love, [[Pete Wisdom]]. Colossus, exhausted, mentally ill, and enraged, attacked Wisdom and, although the battle was short, Piotr nearly killed him. Colossus was subdued by [[Captain Britain]] and [[Meggan (character)|Meggan]],<ref>''Excalibur'' #92</ref> later cured of his illness by [[Moira MacTaggert]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Colossus accepted Shadowcat's new life and chose to become a member of Excalibur.<ref>''Excalibur'' #95</ref> Although Colossus, along with the rest of the team, soon accepted Kitty's relationship with Wisdom, Kitty's pet dragon, Lockheed, did not, and was often seen trying to reunite Kitty with Peter, whom he much preferred. One such example being snatching away the garter during Meggan and Captain Britain's wedding and dropping it into Colossus' hand, who was then required to place it on Kitty's leg, who had previously caught the bride's flowers.<ref>''Excalibur'' #125 (1998)</ref> With Excalibur, he participated in many adventures, including helping to save London from an ancient demon.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Excalibur eventually disbanded, and Colossus returned with Nightcrawler and Shadowcat to the X-Men. But as soon as they returned, they faced a group of [[Cerebro's X-Men|imposters]] following Cerebro, in the guise of Professor X.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #360</ref><ref>''X-Men'' #80</ref> During this time, he repaired his friendships with [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], that were broken when he had joined the Acolytes.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} He formed a deep friendship with [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Peter again found his long thought-dead brother [[Mikhail Rasputin|Mikhail]], but unfortunately lost him again when [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] collected [[X-Men: The Twelve|The Twelve]] in his quest for power.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===Death===
Using thoughts and notes from the recently murdered [[Moira MacTaggert]], the X-Men's resident scientist, [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], claimed to have found the cure for the Legacy Virus. Unfortunately, it could only be made airborne with the death of its first user. Rather than wait for a safer version and allow others to die as Illyana had, Colossus injected himself with the cure. By using his powers and sacrificing himself, Colossus enabled the release of an airborne cure, effectively eradicating the disease. His body was cremated, and Shadowcat took his ashes back to Russia to be scattered on his native soil.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #390</ref>

===Return===
Nearly two years later, it was brought to the attention of the X-Men that a medical company, entitled Benetech, had developed a mutant cure. After gaining a sample of the cure, Dr. Henry (Beast) McCoy discovered a string of [[DNA]] hidden deep within the recesses of the formula. After matching the DNA, Beast and the other X-Men set out to investigate the truth behind Benetech.

During their infiltration, they discovered that [[Ord (comics)|Ord]], an [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|alien]] from the Breakworld, was responsible for the means with which the company was able to develop the cure. While the team was separated, Kitty descended into a hidden complex beneath the Benetech building and was able to unlock the true secret behind the cure: shortly after Peter's self-sacrificing death, Ord had captured his body and left a duplicate that the X-Men had cremated.<ref name="Astonishing X-Men #4">''Astonishing X-Men'' #4</ref>

After reviving him, Ord had used the Legacy Virus cure in Peter's bloodstream to develop his mutant cure. After unknowingly releasing Peter from his cell, Kitty rejoined him with the X-Men. Together they subdued Ord as he tried to escape Earth. Since reuniting with his friends, Peter has returned to fight with the X-Men, and he and Kitty were able to resume their romantic relationship.<ref name= "Astonishing X-Men #4"/>

===Colossus: Bloodline===
During the ''Colossus: Bloodline'' limited series, Colossus made a trip to Russia in response to a call for help from his cousin, journalist Larisa Mishchenko. Her research had established that their family descended from [[Grigori Rasputin]], and that their relatives were being systematically murdered. Rasputin is established as having been a powerful mutant, whose power and life essence had been passed down to his descendants. As his descendants are murdered, his great power is invested in greater measure in the remaining descendants. When there is only one descendant left, Rasputin will be reborn within that individual. [[Mister Sinister]], an old ally of Rasputin, is revealed as the man behind the murders.{{issue|date=May 2017}}

Larisa is murdered by Sinister, but Colossus and his brother Mikhail foil Sinister's plot, and Mikhail banishes himself to a dimension where he can never die, but from which he can never return. If Sinister were to murder Colossus, Rasputin would be reborn in Mikhail, but locked in a dimension on his own. However, all those involved remained unaware of Colossus' son, Peter, in the [[Savage Land]], whose presence could severely alter the situation. Colossus returned to the X-Men, a man without family. It is rumoured that the boy ''Michael Termani'' escaped the extermination and made his way to the United States of America in search of Colossus, whom he may be related to.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===Breakworld and beyond===
During an attack on the institute, Colossus engages [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]], although "Shaw" turned out to be an illusory attack by [[Cassandra Nova]]. It was revealed that Colossus is the mutant destined to destroy [[Ord (comics)|Breakworld]] according to the Breakworld's precogs. However, on a mission to the Breakworld, the X-Men discover that this was not an actual prophecy but an elaborate scheme created by Aghanne, the insane leader of a Breakworld reform cult, intended to bring about that world's destruction. Colossus is chosen for the prophecy as his unique organic steel form would allow him to destroy the planet's power source, initiating a chain reaction that would destroy the entire world. Realizing this, Colossus refuses to kill the planet although he does threaten to seize power and rule it if the Breakworld destroys the Earth as planned.<ref>''Giant-Size Astonishing X-Men'' #1</ref>

During the "[[World War Hulk]]" storyline, Colossus is one of the X-Men members that tries to defend Professor X against the [[Hulk]], who has come looking for Charles as he is one of the members of the secret [[Illuminati (Marvel Comics)|Illuminati]] that exiled him from Earth. During their battle, the Hulk reflects on Colossus' bravery, mentioning that Colossus might have made a "decent opponent" to the Hulk's previous incarnations. Locked in a test of strength, Hulk demonstrates his superior power by bending Colossus's arms backwards at the forearms, breaking them.<ref>''World War Hulk: X-Men'' #2</ref> Beast later uses a laser in the lab to heat his arms up near their melting point, while [[Strong Guy]] bends them back into place; his arms needed to be re-set in their metal form before he transformed back to his human form to avoid serious injury to them.<ref>''World War Hulk: X-Men'' #3</ref>

Colossus returns to Russia with Wolverine and Nightcrawler along for the ride. The trio are captured by the Russian government, who wish to find out why all their mutant agents succumbed to M-Day, and Colossus did not. This led to a battle against the Russians and [[Omega Red]], who was being examined by their captors. After defeating Omega Red, the heroes receive a call from Cyclops informing them of their new home in San Francisco. They soon arrive back in the States, where they aid in rebuilding the X-Men.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #495–499</ref>

Colossus was briefly a member of the [[Fifty State Initiative]] team called ''The Last Defenders'' alongside [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)#Nighthawk|Nighthawk]], [[She-Hulk]], and [[Blazing Skull]].<ref>''The Last Defenders'' #1–3</ref>

Joining the rest of the X-Men, Colossus relocates to San Francisco.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #500</ref> Still mourning Kitty, the other X-Men try to cheer him up using various different methods from picking fights with him to throwing a party. In the end he tells them to leave him be, he just needs time. Later while walking through Golden Gate Park, he come across a little girl who needs help rescuing her ''Kitty'' from a tree to which he replies that nothing would make him happier.<ref>''X-Men: Manifest Destiny'' #3</ref>

===X-Infernus===
{{Main|X-Infernus}}
Colossus feels the X-Men are not doing enough to rescue Illyana from Limbo, and is upset.<ref>''X-Infernus'' #1</ref> With the aid of [[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]], the team is able to enter Limbo, where they encounter hostile demons.<ref>''X-Infernus'' #2</ref> After defeating the demons, the X-Men locate Illyana, who has been defeated by Witchfire.<ref>''X-Infernus'' #3</ref> The X-Men and Magik defeat Witchfire by trapping her in the dimension that houses the Elder Gods. Illyana leaves Limbo with the X-Men when [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and Colossus offer her a home.<ref>''X-Infernus'' #4</ref>

===Utopia===
When the Dark Avengers head into San Francisco to battle any X-Men they can find, Colossus battles Venom.<ref>''Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men: Utopia'' and ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #513</ref> They later face off again when the combined Dark Avengers and Dark X-Men attack Utopia, with Colossus and the X-Men emerging victorious.<ref>''Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men: Exodus''</ref> 
It's also during this time that Colossus suffers from depression due to the loss of Kitty prior to the Messiah Complex. During this period, Magik arrives at Utopia to ask for help from the X-Men and her former teammates as there's a battle coming in Limbo. The reunion helps alleviate some of Colossus's depression, but after Magneto comes to Utopia, Magneto brings the bullet carrying Kitty back to Earth to save her in a show of good faith and Kitty and Colossus are reunited, but are initially unable to touch as Kitty spent so long phased to stop the bullet hitting something that she has 'forgotten' how to resume a tangible state on her own.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer = [[Matt Fraction]]| penciller = [[Whilce Portacio]]| inker = Ed Tadeo| story = Ghostly| title = The Uncanny X-Men| volume = | issue = #522| date = May 2010| publisher = Marvel Comics| location =| page =| panel =| id =}}</ref> Due to Warlord Krunn's mutant cure, Colossus was temporarily depowered and beaten in battle by him,<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #537</ref> but other Breakworld residents were able to restore Kitty to her fully tangible state.{{issue|date=June 2015}}

===Fear Itself===
[[File:Uncanny X-Men 543.jpg|upright|thumb|Colossus as the newly appointed [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] on the cover of ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #543 (September 2011). Art by [[Greg Land]].]]
After the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] became Kuurth: Breaker of Stone, one of the Heralds of a long-dormant god of fear known as the [[Serpent (comics)|Serpent]], Colossus made a bargain with [[Cyttorak]], the other-dimensional being who originally empowered the Juggernaut, to gain the power to stand against Kuurth. Colossus became the new avatar of the Juggernaut and was able to push Cain Marko back until Cain was summoned by The Serpent. This decision caused Kitty to break up with Colossus, as she cannot cope with his increasingly displayed willingness to sacrifice himself when she wants someone who will be willing to ''live'' for her.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #542">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #542</ref>

Due to this, Colossus decides to stay on Utopia with Cyclops' team of X-Men instead of returning to Westchester due to his fear of his new Juggernaut powers being unsafe around children.<ref>''X-Men Regenesis'' #1</ref> After another stressful battle, Colossus realized that his powers were far more dangerous than he realized, and he requested to be locked up alongside his sister, only to be freed when needed on missions.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 2 #10</ref>

===Avengers vs. X-Men===
At the onset of the ''[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]'' storyline, Colossus is featured in fights against several characters, including [[Spider-Man]],<ref>''AVX: VS'' #2</ref> [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]],<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 2 #11</ref> and [[Thing (comics)|Thing]].<ref>''AVX: VS'' #3</ref> He is one of the few X-Men teleported by Magik to the dark side of the moon to confront the Avengers over [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]]. When the disruptor devised by [[Iron Man]] blasts and divides the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]], part of it bonds to Colossus, who becomes one of the Phoenix Five along with Cyclops, Emma Frost, Magik and Namor.<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #5</ref> He attempts to release his Juggernaut powers, but Cyttorak refuses, citing his affiliation with the Phoenix due to his newfound destructive powers.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 2 #15 (AvsX)</ref> While empowered with his fragment of the Phoenix Force, Colossus attempts to regain Kitty's affections, but she rejects him—wary of his power-mongering and that the Phoenix has changed him for the worse—he reacts angrily.<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #14 (July 2012)</ref> Colossus is eventually defeated when Spider-Man manages to provoke him and Magik into attacking each other, causing them to incapacitate each other. Their Phoenix powers dissipate and are absorbed by Emma Frost and Cyclops (Namor having already been defeated).<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #9</ref> Following the defeat of Cyclops as the last of the Phoenix Five, Colossus and the other former members of the Phoenix Five did not surrender themselves to the authorities.<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #12</ref> Magik later purges the Juggernaut powers from Colossus with her Soulsword.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 2 #20</ref> Knowing that Magik could have repelled his servitude to Cyttorak at any time and that she made him keep the Juggernaut powers to teach him a lesson, Colossus evinces hatred toward the sister he once loved, going so far as to say he wants her killed.<ref>''AvX: Consequences'' #4</ref>

===X-Force===
Colossus's powers have gone out of control, apparently as a result of losing the Phoenix Force, causing parts of him to shift between flesh and organic steel rather than all flesh or all organic steel.<ref>''Cable and X-Force'' #2</ref> He now appears as a member of Cable's new X-Force team after Cable provides him with a device that stabilizes his condition.<ref>''Cable and X-Force'' #3</ref>

===Amazing X-Men===
Colossus has since rejoined Wolverine's team of X-Men after his sister convinced him to,<ref name="Amazing X-Men #6">''Amazing X-Men'' #6</ref> after quitting Cable's X-Force team following the results of the Cable and X-Force/Uncanny X-Force: Vendettas storyline.{{issue|date=July 2014}} It is eventually discovered that Cyclops, Emma Frost, Magik, Magneto and Colossus were actually infected with nano-sentinels by [[Dark Beast]], after the incident with the Phoenix Force, and that was the real cause for their flawed abilities.{{issue|date=February 2017}} He has since regained control of his organic steel powers and has stopped wearing Cable's harness which helped him to stabilize his flesh and steel forms.<ref name="Amazing X-Men #6"/>

During this time, Cyttorak caused the Crimson Gem to reappear in the ancient temple and triggered a call for suitable candidates to become a new Juggernaut, which led to Colossus and Cain Marko joining a team of X-Men to stop the Gem from being claimed by forces such as [[Man-Killer]] and the former [[Living Monolith]]. However, when Adbol acquired the Gem for himself, Colossus invoked Cyttorak to confront him about the failure of all of his past Juggernauts, suggesting that Cyttorak withdraw his power from Adbol and empower a new avatar to a greater extent than any before. Unfortunately, Cyttorak chose to empower Marko rather than Colossus, with Marko resolving to destroy the X-Men present and then move on to kill Cyclops for the death of Professor X. With Marko now even immune to psychic attacks, he appeared truly unstoppable, but Colossus was able to defeat him by outmaneuvering the super-empowered Marko until he could strike the sea side cliff edge where they had been fighting, causing Cain to fall into the ocean below, taking him out of the fight at least for the moment.<ref name="Amazing X-Men vol. 2 #16–19">''Amazing X-Men'' vol. 2 #16–19</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, Colossus is with the X-Men when they take part in the incursion event between Earth-616 and Earth-1610. The Hulk's Doc Green form uses Colossus in a Fastball Special that destroys the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]].<ref>''Secret Wars'' #1</ref>

===Extraordinary X-Men===
Colossus later joins Storm's new team of X-Men who are living in an isolated part of [[Limbo (Marvel Comics)|Limbo]] after magically transporting the mansion there, renaming it [[X-Mansion#X-Haven|X-Haven]]. Their mission is to provide a refuge and protect mutants from the effects of the M-Pox that has infected the mutants and rendered almost all of the mutant species sterile due to the [[Terrigen]] in the atmosphere.{{issue|date=July 2016}} During the Apocalypse Wars, Colossus, Ernst, Anole, Glob Herman and No-Girl are separated from Storm's team. When they re-encounter the missing students, they discover them to now be adults protecting an ark of 600 artificially created mutant embryos from the Four Horsemen of Apocalypse, one of whom is a celestially altered Colossus.<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #12</ref>

Colossus was eventually found by his teammates Iceman and Nightcrawler<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #14</ref> and teleported back to X-Haven by Cerebra.<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #15</ref> There, he was transformed back to normal by Apocalypse, who was tricked into doing so by Nightcrawler.<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #16</ref>

===''Inhumans vs X-Men'' and ''X-Men Gold''===
After Beast discovers that there isn't a cure for the M-Pox and no way to alter the Terrigen cloud the X-Men are left with the choice to either stay on earth and fight for their right to live and risk becoming extinct in a matter of weeks or leave earth and start fresh somewhere else. The X-Men decide to go to [[Inhumans vs. X-Men|war against the]] [[Inhumans]] to decide the fate of the Terrigen. With the war underway Colossus is stationed at X-Haven to protect it from a potential Inhuman counter-attack. When the [[Inhuman Royal Family]] arrives to do just that, Colossus is left to face them on his own. He later joins the rest of the X-Men in Iceland in the final battle against the Inhumans, where [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] finally understands what the X-Men are fighting for so she voluntarily destroys the Terrigen.<ref>''Inhumans vs X-Men'' #0-6</ref>

After the Terrigen is destroyed the X-Men sends the refugees back home from X-Haven now that earth is habitable for mutants again. Still, the X-Men find themselves wondering how to move forward with the events of the war still fresh in their minds. Storm asks Kitty Pryde to return to the X-Men and take her place as leader, and in doing so Kitty moves the mansion from Limbo to Central Park and creates a new field team and recruits Colossus. Colossus and Kitty share many awkward moments given their history, trying to move forward as friends but still feeling a chemistry.<ref>''X-Men Gold'' #1-3</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Colossus is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the ability to transform his entire body into a form of "organic steel", with properties similar to [[osmium]] but of still unknown composition. Colossus must transform his entire body into this armored state; he cannot transform only a portion of his body. When he transforms, he gains approximately {{convert|1|ft|cm|abbr=on}} in height; official figures state his height at about {{convert|7|ft|5|in|cm|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} in transformed state versus {{convert|6|ft|6|in|cm|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} in normal human form. His weight is more than doubled.<ref>''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' vol. 4 #19</ref> In his armored form, Colossus possesses superhuman levels of strength, as well as superhuman stamina and durability. His physical strength is currently greater than when he first joined the X-Men due to the realignment of his cells by Magneto following an injury during the [[Mutant Massacre]]. While in his armored form, Colossus requires no food, water or even oxygen to sustain himself and is extremely resistant to injury. He is capable of withstanding great impacts, large caliber bullets, falling from tremendous heights, electricity, and certain magical attacks.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #188</ref> While he has great resistance to temperature extremes of hot and cold, extreme heat followed by rapid super-cooling has been shown to cause damage. As he is vulnerable to the anti-metal [[Vibranium#Antarctic variety|Antarctic Vibranium]] in his metal form, his body instinctively shifts to human form when faced with an Antarctic Vibranium weapon.<ref>''X-Men/Spider-Man'' #4</ref>

Colossus is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained in [[Judo]] by [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]].<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #121 (May 1979)</ref> He has had training in acrobatics and sword fighting<ref>''Excalibur'' #108 (April 1997)</ref> from [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]. In his human form, he is still exceptionally strong and in superb physical condition, though not superhumanly so. He has completed college-level courses at Xavier's school.{{issue|date=January 2020}}

As the unstoppable [[Juggernaut (comics)|Avatar of Cyttorak]], Colossus gained additional superhuman strength and resistance to injury, as well as other mystical powers. Among these was the power to ignore impediments to his movement, hence the "unstoppable" moniker.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #542"/> These powers were later taken away from Colossus and returned to Cain Marko.<ref name="Amazing X-Men vol. 2 #16–19"/>

==Reception==
* In 2018, ''[[CBR.com]]'' ranked Colossus 7th in their "Age Of Apocalypse: The 30 Strongest Characters In Marvel's Coolest Alternate World" list.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lealos |first=Shawn S. |date=2018-09-16 |title=Age Of Apocalypse: The 30 Strongest Characters In Marvel's Coolest Alternate World |url=https://www.cbr.com/age-of-apocalypse-characters-ranked/ |access-date=2022-10-11 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]] timeline, Piotr Rasputin/Colossus was a very haunted man, wearing a red mask to cover acid scars on his face. His sister, [[Magik (Illyana Rasputin)#Age of Apocalypse|Illyana Rasputin]], was thought to have died years prior, and his brother, [[Mikhail Rasputin#Age of Apocalypse|Mikhail Rasputin]], was captured by Apocalypse. Colossus became leader of the Super Soldiers and faced his brainwashed brother in combat. Now a Horseman of Apocalypse, Mikhail destroyed all of Russia's superheroes except his brother, and from that day the severely beaten Colossus chose to dedicate his life to stopping Apocalypse and Mikhail. He left Russia to find the X-Men. Colossus was one of [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)#Earth-295 (Age of Apocalypse)|Magneto's]] original recruits for his X-Men.{{issue|date=September 2020}}

During his first mission as an X-Man, Colossus battled Sabretooth for the life of a young [[Jewish American]] mutant named [[Kitty Pryde#Age of Apocalypse|Katherine Pryde/Shadowcat]]. Colossus fell in love with her, and the two would eventually marry. After years of fighting for Magneto's cause, Colossus lost the will to fight on a battlefield in Africa. He decided to retire from the X-Men. As a final favor to Magneto, he agreed to teach the next generation of mutants with his wife.{{issue|date=September 2020}}

Colossus came out of retirement two times. The first time, he was injured so severely only Magneto's metal powers kept him alive. Colossus could not transform back to his human self without risking death. The second time, Magneto offered Colossus and Shadowcat an important mission. It was discovered that Illyana was indeed still alive and being held prisoner in a slave camp, and they needed to save her so they could restore the true timeline.{{issue|date=September 2020}}

Colossus and Shadowcat sent their team into the Seattle Core to rescue Illyana. After they found her, Colossus demanded Shadowcat evacuate Illyana immediately, leaving their students behind. Shadowcat disagreed, but followed his orders after he told her that he would go back for their students. Colossus reached the front gate and peered back into the Core. Only one student, Husk, remained standing. Colossus allowed the gate to close without attempting to help. He returned to his wife and sister and claimed he had done all he could.{{issue|date=September 2020}}

Colossus and Shadowcat delivered Illyana to Magneto, but after learning the reality Magneto was trying to save was a place where his sister was dead, Colossus went mad. He tried to follow his sister into the M'Kraan Crystal, injuring Iceman in the process, and when Shadowcat stepped in front of him, assuming he would calm down, he didn't. Colossus crushed his wife and killed her. Insane with grief, he was finally taken down by [[Gambit (Marvel Comics)#Age of Apocalypse|Gambit]].{{issue|date=September 2020}}

Mortally injured, he reverts to his human form and dies after his sister returns from the M'kraan Crystal.<ref>''X-Men: Omega''</ref>

Years later, when Weapon X had been transformed into Weapon Omega, the Heir of Apocalypse, Colossus was brought back to life through the combined efforts of Sugarman and Dark Beast, who had taken great pains to find and preserve his body. Along with many other "alphas", his mind was altered, turning him into a servant of Weapon Omega.{{issue|date=September 2020}}

He was sent together with Azazel and Cyclops to confront another resurrected "alpha", Penance. Penance used her telepathic powers to restore Colossus' true memories, and he swore to help her in her quest to rebuild the world and lead mutants to a brighter future. A fight broke out between him and Cyclop, but Azazel teleported Cyclops and himself away.{{issue|date=September 2020}}

===Days of Future Past===
In the ''[[Days of Future Past]]'' timeline ([[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Earth-811]]), Colossus was detained in the South Bronx Mutant Containment Facility, like most of the surviving [[X-Men]]. In this reality he married Kate Pryde and they had children. When his wife transferred her consciousness into the [[Kitty Pride]] of [[Earth-616]] and fell unconscious, Colossus tried to protect her from the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]]. As one of the last mutants on Earth, he infiltrated the [[Baxter Building]] on a suicide run in which he was killed by Sentinels trying to avenge the deaths of [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].{{issue|date=September 2020}}

===Earth X===
In [[Earth X]], Colossus has become [[Tsar]] Piotr of Russia. His country's massive grain supply, protected by an army of Crimson Dynamos, provides one of the greatest food sources for the world. Occasionally, he is attacked by Life Model Decoys of [[Nick Fury]], who seem to think that Piotr is a stereotypical Communist. It is mentioned in passing that at some point in the future, he will travel back in time and become [[Mister Sinister]].<ref>''Paradise X'' #3</ref>

===Exiles===
Several versions of Colossus have been seen in the ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'' series.
* One was killed after betraying his [[Heroes for Hire]] teammates to save the alternative version of his sister, [[Magik (Illyana Rasputin)#Exiles|Magik]].<ref>''Exiles'' #26-27</ref>
* One dies protecting an alternative version of [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]].<ref>''Exiles'' #40</ref>

===Marvel Zombies===
A version of Colossus is seen in ''Dead Days'' when the zombifed Alpha Flight attack the mansion. Later, he is seen among the survivors and fighting the other zombie heroes. Colossus, Nightcrawler, Storm, Dr. Strange, Nick Fury and Thor fight a holding action to protect a teleporter from the zombie forces. The group realizes that their plan to evacuate survivors might lead to another innocent world being infected so they destroy the machine and willingly give themselves up to the zombies.<ref>''Marvel Zombies: Dead Days'' One-Shot (July 2007)</ref>

In Marvel Zombies: Halloween, Kitty Pryde and her son with Colossus, Peter Rasputin Pryde are two of the few surviving humans, years later.<ref>''Marvel Zombies: Halloween'' One-Shot (Oct. 2012)</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Peter Rasputin reluctantly works as an arms smuggler for the [[Russian mafia|Russian mob]]. Peter was saved from a firing squad as a young child by a boss in the Russian Mafia called Big Boris, who smuggles Peter from [[Siberia]] to the [[United States]]. Colossus' powers are similar to those of his [[Earth-616]] counterpart. With the use of a deadly drug called Banshee, he has gained super strength to rival other powerhouses such as Thor. He is not immune to [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]'s touch as shown in the "Return to Weapon X" storyline.  He is also highly resistant to physical injury. He has withstood being slashed by [[Wolverine (Ultimate Marvel character)|Ultimate Wolverine]]'s [[adamantium]] claws. He has also survived a localized nuclear explosion. A few deviations from the [[Earth-616]] version include the fact that Ultimate Colossus's height remains the same when he changes. Unlike the mainstream version, his eyes remain vulnerable to pressure even in steel form, as shown when fighting [[Falcon (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Sam Wilson]] during ''[[Ultimate Nightmare]]''.<ref>''Ultimate Nightmare'' #4</ref>

Colossus is revealed as a mutant during an illegal arms transaction gone wrong. Everyone is killed by gunfire except for Peter, whose mutant ability saves him. [[Jean Grey#Ultimate Marvel|Jean Grey]] finds him soon after and offers him a place among the [[X-Men]].<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #1</ref>

When the X-Men embark on a world tour to promote [[Alternative versions of Professor X#Ultimate Marvel|Xavier's]] book, Colossus inexplicably disappears to Russia. [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Cyclops]] and Jean Grey track him and find Peter working in a factory. Colossus tells them he left due to unhappiness with his place on the team and with life as a mutant, but Jean suggests that his true reason is unrequited feelings he has for a fellow team member. Peter later comes to terms with his "gift," and becomes a Russian national hero when he rescues the crew of an incapacitated submarine. He leaves Russia to rejoin the X-Men.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

Later, Colossus and the X-Men are forced out of the mansion with the U.S. Government on their tails. In a climactic battle between the [[X-Men]] and [[Ultimates|The Ultimates]], Colossus is able to defeat [[Iron Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Iron Man]] and [[Thor (Ultimate Marvel character)|Thor]], but is finally temporarily incapacitated by [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)#Ultimate Marvel|Hawkeye]] who fires a compact nuclear warhead arrow (with a blast radius of about 20 feet) near him. With the surprise assistance from [[Iceman (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Iceman]], the X-Men (without Professor Xavier) manage to regroup and escape.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

The X-Men locate [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Magneto]]'s flying citadel using a signal sent by a captured Cyclops. Upon their arrival, Magneto subdues them. Despite being composed of metal, Colossus' great strength and willpower allow him to overcome Magneto's control and beat Magneto mercilessly for the harm inflicted on Wolverine.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

Unlike his mainstream counterpart, Ultimate Colossus is gay and does not have a romance with Ultimate Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat. This is implied during the Mark Millar's run on the title, through his interactions with fellow X-Man Wolverine (this is implied during the "Return of the King" story arc, in which Colossus almost beats Magneto to a pulp when he threatens Wolverine). It is implied (through stereotype) when Jean Grey reveals to the readers that Peter's favorite TV show is ''[[Will & Grace]]'', but stated more directly in that the main reason Colossus left the X-Men might have been that he was unable to make the X-Man he'd fallen in love with love him, even in the slightest. [[Storm (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Storm]] also suggests Peter is gay when [[Warren Worthington III#Ultimate Marvel|Angel]] arrives at the school and Storm explains to him that the reason that all the girls "and ''maybe'' Colossus" stare at him is because he is good looking. It is more openly addressed later during a series of mutant murders by [[Mister Sinister#Ultimate Marvel|Sinister]], Colossus tends to the wounds of [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]], the only survivor. He is shocked when the openly gay Northstar asks if Colossus is single, which triggers a transformation into his metal state.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #47</ref>

Colossus and Northstar amicably part ways and keep in touch even after Northstar's team, the [[New Mutants#Ultimate Marvel|Academy of Tomorrow]], come to blows with the X-Men. Colossus later agrees to accompany Northstar to his [[homecoming]] dance. This disturbs [[Nightcrawler (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Nightcrawler]], Peter's friend, who begins to avoid and resent him. Their relationship becomes very strained after this and never really recovers, Nightcrawler believing that Colossus deliberately misled and "betrayed" him. This also marks a significant change in Nightcrawler's character: much of his relationship with Colossus in the mainstream versions of them also involves Kitty Pryde (Colossus' recurring love interest throughout most of the various X-Men chronicles)'s close relationship with Nightcrawler. In this version, there is no romantic relations between Pryde and Rasputin and all three characters are affected. In other versions, Nightcrawler is routinely seen as an outsider trying desperately to fit in, more so than the other X-Men, but in this one his blatant homophobia and disgust towards Colossus is a strong theme. Comments have been made with a double meaning toward Peter's sexuality, such as Bobby Drake saying "Too bad he's playing for the other team" during a baseball game against the Academy of Tomorrow.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #94</ref>

Following Xavier's death, Northstar asks Colossus to come stay with him at the Academy of Tomorrow. Colossus finds a job as a construction worker and refuses to join Bishop's X-Men team.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #83</ref>

It has been revealed that Colossus is dependent on the mutant enhancement drug Banshee for his super-human strength; without it, he cannot so much as lift his arms in his organic steel mode. It was also revealed that Peter came to work for the Russian mob after being banished from his home by his father, who had accidentally discovered him in bed with another man. Colossus briefly formed a Banshee-enhanced splinter group of X-Men, but they have since rejoined the main group drug-free.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #97</ref>

After rejoining the main X-Men team, a tsunami hits New York and kills numerous people and superheroes including some of his teammates (Beast, Dazzler, and Nightcrawler). He fights against Magneto and his Brotherhood in their attack on the world.<ref>''Ultimatum'' #1</ref> Colossus, alongside Jean Grey, Storm, Iceman, and Rogue, is one of the few X-Men to survive Magneto's rampage.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men: Requiem'' (July 2009)</ref>

At the end of Ultimate X #5, Colossus is shown being held in a government facility: "Camp Angel" along with Storm and Spiral. It can be inferred from the narration of Karen Grant that the government is using them for testing on how to remove the mutant gene. At the start of [[Ultimate Comics: X-Men]] as a series, Colossus is seen in this camp. Despite the government's claims that mutants are being well-treated, Colossus is being maliciously tortured with electrical sticks.<ref name="Ultimate Comics: X-Men #1">''Ultimate Comics: X-Men'' #1</ref> When the prison is overruled, and arguments started between Storm and [[Stacy X]] over the treatment of Warden Lake and [[U.S. Agent (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Major Walker]], until Colossus kills Lake, summoning a fleet of [[Nimrod (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Nimrod Model Sentinels]].<ref name="Ultimate Comics: X-Men #1"/>

=== X-Men Forever ===
In ''[[X-Men Forever]]'', Colossus returns to Russia after the events of ''X-Men'' #1-3, where he becomes a government agent, handled by [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Natalia Romanova]], the Black Widow, with whom he has struck up a romance. Although overjoyed to see his old teammates again, he is intent on staying and serving his country.<ref>''X-Men Forever'' #11</ref>

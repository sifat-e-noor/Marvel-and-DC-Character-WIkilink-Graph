The '''''Daily Bugle''''' (at one time '''''The DB''''')<ref name="Burned!">[http://www.comicvine.com/the-amazing-spider-man-burned/37-125665/ ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #554 – "Burned!"]</ref> is a fictional New York City [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid newspaper]] appearing as a plot element in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The ''Daily Bugle'' is a regular fixture in the [[Marvel Universe]], most prominently in [[Spider-Man]] comic titles and their derivative media. The newspaper first appeared in the [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]] story in ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]'' #18 (April [[1941 in comics|1941]]), returned in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #2 (Jan. [[1962 in comics|1962]]), and its offices first shown in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #1 (March [[1963 in comics|1963]]). The ''Daily Bugle'' was first featured on film in the 2002 film ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]''. The fictional newspaper is meant to be a [[pastiche]] of both the New York ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' and the ''[[New York Post]]'', two popular real-life New York City [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]s.

The outlet appears in [[Sam Raimi]]'s [[Spider-Man (2002 film series)|''Spider-Man'' trilogy]] (2002–07), [[Marc Webb]]'s [[The Amazing Spider-Man (film series)|''The Amazing Spider-Man'' duology]] (2012–14) and [[Sony's Spider-Man Universe]] (2018–present). The agency is reimagined as a sensationalist news website in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|films]] ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (2019) and ''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]'' (2021), and [[web series]] ''[[The Daily Bugle (web series)|The Daily Bugle]]'' (2019–present), headlined by [[J. K. Simmons]] and [[Angourie Rice]] as [[J. Jonah Jameson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|J. Jonah Jameson]] and [[Betty Brant (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Betty Brant]] and Nicque Marina.

==Publishing history==
The ''Daily Bugle'' is featured prominently in many Marvel Comics titles, especially those in which [[Spider-Man]] is the lead character. In [[1996 in comics|1996]], a three-issue (black and white) limited series was printed.

Since [[2006 in comics|2006]], Marvel has published a monthly ''Daily Bugle'' newspaper reporting on the company's publications and authors. Marvel earlier used the newspaper format to promote Marvel's crossover events ''[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]'' and ''[[House of M]]''—reporting on storyline events as if the comic book ''Daily Bugle'' had come to life. Marvel restored this promotional function for the [[2007 in comics|2007]] death of [[Captain America]].

==Fictional History==
The ''Daily Bugle'' was founded in 1898 and has been published daily ever since. The ''Daily Bugle'' is printed in tabloid format like its rival the ''Daily Globe''. The editor and publisher of the ''Bugle'', [[J. Jonah Jameson]], began his journalistic career as a reporter for the ''Bugle'' while still in high school. Jameson purchased the then-floundering ''Bugle'' with inheritance funds, from his recently deceased father-in-law and turned the paper into a popular success. Other magazines published from time-to-time include the revived ''Now'' magazine and the now-defunct ''Woman'' magazine, edited by [[Carol Danvers]].

J. Jonah Jameson, Inc. purchased the Goodman Building on [[39th Street (Manhattan)|39th Street]] and [[Second Avenue (Manhattan)|Second Avenue]] in 1936 and moved its entire editorial and publishing facilities there.<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 36–39 | isbn = 978-1-4165-3141-8}}</ref> Now called the Daily Bugle Building, the office complex is forty-six stories tall, and is capped by the ''Daily Bugle'' logo in {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} letters on the roof. There are loading docks in the rear of the building, reached by a back alley. Three floors are devoted to the editorial office of the ''Bugle'' and two sub-basement levels to the printing presses, while the rest of the floors are rented. (A panel in #105 of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' showed the ''Bugle'' building located near a street sign at the corner of [[Madison Avenue (Manhattan)|Madison Avenue]] and a street in the East Fifties (the second digit was not shown). This suggests that the building may have been relocated at some point.)

The newspaper is noted for its anti-[[superhero]] slant, especially concerning [[Spider-Man]], whom the paper constantly smears as a part of its editorial policy. However, the Editor-in-Chief, "Robbie" Robertson, the only subordinate to Jameson who is not intimidated by him, has worked to moderate it. More positively, the newspaper has also published important exposés of political corruption and organized crime in the city, and also takes a strong stance in favor of [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant rights]], which has led to its being targeted by various criminals and hate groups.

Due to declining circulation, Jameson has conceded to Robertson's objections and has created a special feature section of the paper called ''[[The Pulse (comics)|The Pulse]]'', which focuses on superheroes. In addition, the paper also intermittently ran a [[glossy magazine]] called ''Now Magazine''.

Soon after the team's formation, the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] decided to strike a deal with Jameson regarding exclusive content in exchange for removing the strong anti-Spider-Man sentiment from the newspaper, to which Jameson agreed. Merely one day later, Jameson broke the spirit (though not the letter) of his agreement with [[Iron Man]], using the headline "''a wanted murderer'' ([[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]), ''an alleged ex-member of a terrorist organization'' ([[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]]) ''and a convicted heroin-dealer'' ([[Luke Cage]]) ''are just some of the new recruits set to bury the once good name of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]],''" but refraining from attacking Spider-Man. This prompted [[Jessica Jones]] to sell the first pictures of her newborn baby to one of the ''Bugle'''s competitors instead.

In the first issue of [[Runaways (comics)|''Runaways'' vol. 2]], [[Victor Mancha]] states in an exchange about Spider-Man that ''"The only people who think he's a criminal are [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] and the ''Daily Bugle''. And the ''Bugle'' is, like, the least respected newspaper in New York City."'' The paper's major named competitors are the ''Daily Globe'', which implicitly takes a more balanced look at the superhero, ''Front Line'', run by EIC [[Ben Urich]] and [[Sally Floyd (comics)|Sally Floyd]], and ''The Alternative''. After Peter Parker revealed he is Spider-Man and the ''Bugle'' planned to sue him for fraud, the paper itself was put on the defensive with front page accusations from ''The Globe'' (with information secretly supplied by ''Bugle'' reporter [[Betty Brant]]) of [[defamation|libel]]ing the superhero.

The adventures of the staff of the newspaper beyond Peter Parker have been depicted in two series, ''Daily Bugle'' and ''The Pulse''.

===''The DB''===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:TheDB.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''DB'' building, from<br>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' No. 555 (2008)<br>Art by [[Chris Bachalo]].]] -->
After Jameson suffered a near-fatal heart attack, his wife sold the ''Bugle'' to rival newspaper man [[Dexter Bennett]], who changed the name to '''The DB''' (either standing for Dexter Bennett or ''Daily Bugle''), and transformed it into a [[scandal sheet]].<ref name="Burned!"/> Since after ''Brand New Day'' no one knows the secret identity of Spider-Man anymore, the animosity between Jameson and Parker is [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] as a simple financial question, with Jameson's heart attack coming right after a monetary request from Peter.

The reputation of the DB since the mention in Runaways has plummeted down because of the new, scandalistic angle Bennett gives it. Several reporters unwilling, or refusing the new course, like Peter himself, are forced to go away, finding a new safe haven in the ''[[#Front Line|Front Line]]'', the only magazine willing to accept people fired by Bennett, pursuing a ''scorched earth'' policy over them.

The villain [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] targeted Dexter Bennett because of a government bailout plan for the financially strapped paper. Spider-Man intervened, and during a battle inside the DB offices, the entire building was demolished, bringing an end to the newspaper as well.<ref name="Power to the People Part 3">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #614</ref>

===''Front Line''===
'''Front Line''' was a newspaper founded and run by [[Ben Urich]] and [[Sally Floyd (comics)|Sally Floyd]]. The organization was formed in ''[[Civil War: Front Line]]'' #11 as '''Frontlines.com'''. The newspaper appeared in the miniseries ''[[World War Hulk: Front Line]]'' and ''[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]: Embedded''. Originally it was not competitive with the ''Daily Bugle'' while Jameson was still in charge, but it became an alternative view to ''The DB'' once Bennett took control.

===Reborn===
Sometime after the DB's destruction, Jameson, now the mayor of New York cashed in the DB shares he acquired from Bennett and gave the money to Robbie Robertson. Jameson asked Robertson to remake ''Front Line'' (which itself was on hard times) into the new ''Daily Bugle''.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #648</ref>

== Other versions ==
=== Age of Apocalypse ===
In the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' timeline, the ''Daily Bugle'' is a clandestine paper run by humans meant to inform the public about the secrets of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], here the tyrannical ruler of North America. This ''Daily Bugle'' is run by a Robbie Robertson, who is killed by a [[Brood (comics)|Brood]]-infected [[Corsair (comics)|Christopher Summers]], leaving the status of the paper unknown.<ref>''Tales From The Age of Apocalypse'' #2 (Dec. 1997)</ref>

=== Amalgam ===
The ''Daily Bugle'' appears in the Amalgam (DC & Marvel Comics) world. Similar to the mainstream ''Bugle'', employees include J. Jonah White, Tana Moon, Jack Ryder and [[Spider-Boy]]. In this world, the Daily Bugle regularly produces cover stories revolving around Spider-Boy's love life.<ref name="SpiBoy1">{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Karl Kesel]] | Penciller = [[Mike Wieringo]] | Inker = [[Karl Kesel]] & [[Gary Martin (comics)|Gary Martin]] | Story = Big Trouble | Title = Spider-Boy | Issue = #1 | Date = April 1996 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]/[[DC Comics]]/[[Amalgam Comics]] }}</ref>

=== 1602 ===
In the ''[[Marvel 1602]]'' setting, Jameson is publisher of the first "news-sheet" in the New World; the ''Daily Trumpet''.

=== House of M ===
In this alternate reality, the ''Daily Bugle'' exists mostly as a propaganda machine for the ruling mutant hierarchy. Stories can be and are repressed if they aren't favorable enough to mutants. In this reality, a blue-skinned woman named Cerena Taylor is the editor-in-chief. Other staff members include Bugman (the ''Daily Bugle'''s paparazzi driver), Jacob Guntherson (the Daily Bugle's photographer), and Triporter (the Daily Bugle's three-eyed reporter).

=== Ultimate Marvel ===
In the ''[[Ultimate Marvel]]'' universe, the ''Bugle'' is much the same as in the 616 version. The main difference is that Peter Parker is not employed as a photographer, but works on the newspaper's website after Jameson sees him assist with a problem. The newspaper plays less of a role in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' than it did in the comics portraying the equivalent period of the 616 Spider-Man's career. Peter frequently implies that he doesn't spend much time there. After the events of [[Ultimatum (comics)|Ultimatum]], the ''Daily Bugle'', much like the rest of New York, was heavily damaged. Instead of a full rebuild, the ''Bugle'' was made into an online newspaper and blog.

===Film===
====Sam Raimi's ''Spider-Man'' trilogy====
The ''Daily Bugle'' appears in the live-action films ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' (2002), ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' (2004), and ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' (2007), all directed by [[Sam Raimi]]. This version is housed in the [[Flatiron Building]] like in the ''[[Marvels]]'' miniseries, with [[J. Jonah Jameson (film character)|J. Jonah Jameson]] (portrayed by [[J. K. Simmons]]) as the editor in-chief, [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Robbie Robertson]] (portrayed by [[Bill Nunn]]) as associate editor, and [[Betty Brant]] (portrayed by [[Elizabeth Banks]]), [[Peter Parker (Sam Raimi film series)|Peter Parker]] (portrayed by [[Tobey Maguire]]), and [[Eddie Brock#Film|Eddie Brock]] (portrayed by [[Topher Grace]]) as employees.

====20th Century Fox's ''Daredevil'' film====
[[Ben Urich]] appears in the live-action film ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]'' (2003), although he works for the ''[[New York Post]]'' instead, as the film rights to the ''Daily Bugle'' were owned by Columbia Pictures at the time.

====Marc Webb's ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' films====
The ''Daily Bugle'' appears as both a newspaper and television station in the live-action films ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' (2012) and ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'' (2014), both directed by [[Marc Webb]]. [[Peter Parker (The Amazing Spider-Man film series)|Peter Parker]] (portrayed by [[Andrew Garfield]]) works for the ''Bugle'' in the second film. Jameson is mentioned, but does not appear physically.  To promote the second film, an official ''Daily Bugle'' blog was hosted on Tumblr, where promotional material was posted as in-universe articles.

====''Spider-Verse'' animated films====
The ''Daily Bugle'' appears via Peter B. Parker's flashback in ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]'' (2018).

====Sony's Spider-Man Universe====
In films set in [[Sony's Spider-Man Universe]], the ''Daily Bugle'' appears as a newspaper outlet with the same title treatment as the version seen in Sam Raimi's ''Spider-Man'' trilogy.

In the live-action film ''[[Venom: Let There Be Carnage]]'' (2021), the ''Bugle'' documents convicted serial killer [[Cletus Kasady]]'s crimes, which [[Eddie Brock (Sony's Spider-Man Universe)|Eddie Brock]] (portrayed by [[Tom Hardy]]) and [[Toxin (comics)|Patrick Mulligan]] read while separately collecting evidence for his crimes. In the mid-credits scene, Brock and [[Venom (Sony's Spider-Man Universe)|Venom]] are transported to the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) and watch Jameson of ''TheDailyBugle.net'' broadcasting Peter Parker's identity as Spider-Man, as seen in ''Far From Home''.

During the events of the film ''[[Morbius (film)|Morbius]]'' (2022), [[Morbius (film)#Cast|Milo]] ([[Matt Smith]]) orders a ''Daily Bugle'' newspaper from a street news stand in [[New York City]]. The organization is also established to have an online presence in a similar fashion to ''TheDailyBugle.net''. In a deleted scene, [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Michael Morbius]] reads the front page of a ''Bugle'' newspaper covering his apprehension by the police for a "vampire murder" case.<ref>{{Citation|last=pm|first=Jesse SchedeenUpdated: 2 Nov 2021 2:41 pmPosted: 2 Nov 2021 1:03|title=Which Marvel Universe Does Morbius Exist in? - IGN|date=November 2, 2021 |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/morbius-trailer-breakdown-marvel-connections-easter-eggs-venom-spider-man-mcu|language=en|access-date=2021-11-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Newby |first=Richard |date=2022-04-01 |title=6 Spider-Man and Venom References You May Have Missed in Morbius |url=https://www.vulture.com/2022/04/6-spider-man-and-venom-references-in-morbius.html |access-date=2022-04-11 |website=Vulture |language=en-us}}</ref>

===Marvel Cinematic Universe===
[[Christine Everhart (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Christine Everhart]] is featured prominently in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008) and ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010) as well as part of promotional material for ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' (2015) and ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016). Due to Sony Pictures owning the ''Spider-Man'' film rights and all associated characters and organizations at the time, Everhart was not announced as being portrayed as a reporter for the ''Daily Bugle.'' Instead, she initially works as a journalist for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' before transitioning towards being an anchor for the in-universe news organization ''[[WHIH Newsfront]]'' in later years.

[[Ben Urich (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ben Urich]] appears as a series regular in the first season of the [[Netflix]] television series ''[[Marvel's Daredevil]]''. However, since the show was in production prior to Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures' agreement to share the ''Spider-Man'' film rights, the crew on the show were also restricted from adapting the character as a ''Daily Bugle'' employee. Instead, he works for the fictional newspaper agency the ''New York Bulletin'', whose origins in the comics included the company being established by Caxton J. Ford, a former ''Daily Bugle'' employee. The agency is also featured prominently throughout the rest of [[Marvel's Netflix television series]], which all share continuity with the MCU.

A controversial online news outlet called '''''[[TheDailyBugle.net]]''''' appears in the [[mid-credits scene]] of the live-action film ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (2019),. The outlet is run by [[J. Jonah Jameson (film character)|J. Jonah Jameson]] (again portrayed by J. K. Simmons), who plays doctored footage sent in by one of [[Mysterio (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mysterio]]'s associates to demonize [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Spider-Man]] (portrayed by [[Tom Holland]]) before publicly revealing his [[secret identity]].

The outlet and Jameson return in the sequel ''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]'' (2021) and the [[web series]] ''[[The Daily Bugle (web series)|The Daily Bugle]]'' (2019–present), the latter of which is headlined by Simmons as Jameson and [[Angourie Rice]] as [[Betty Brant (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Betty Brant]]. In the film, Jameson launches a misinformed slander campaign against Parker following the reveal of his secret identity as Spider-Man while Brant, who is undergoing an internship at the firm, serves as a correspondent for Jameson while continuing her work on Midtown High's news program, covering Parker's celebrity status within the school. Following [[Stephen Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Doctor Strange]]'s second, successful attempt at wiping the world's knowledge of Peter's civilian identity, Jameson resumes his coverage of Spider-Man's vigilante activity while promising his viewers that he will uncover the truth of his secret identity.

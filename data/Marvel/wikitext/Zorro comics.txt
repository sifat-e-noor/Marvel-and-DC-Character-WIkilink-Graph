'''Zorro''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for 'fox') is a fictional character created in 1919 by American [[pulp magazine|pulp]] writer [[Johnston McCulley]], appearing in works set in the [[Pueblo of Los Angeles]] in [[Alta California]].<ref name="WP-20201229">{{cite news |last=Sragow |first=Michale |title=Zorro at 100: Why the original swashbuckler is still the quintessential American action hero |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/zorro-100-birthday-movies/2020/12/29/455d6e30-4596-11eb-a277-49a6d1f9dff1_story.html |date=December 29, 2020 |access-date=January 2, 2021}}</ref> He is typically portrayed as a dashing masked [[vigilante]] who defends the [[commoner]]s and [[indigenous peoples of California]] against corrupt and tyrannical officials and other villains. His signature all-black [[costume]] includes a cape, a hat known as a {{lang|es|[[sombrero cordobés]]}}, and a mask covering the upper half of his face.

In the stories, Zorro has a high [[Bounty (reward)|bounty]] on his head, but is too skilled and cunning for the bumbling authorities to catch, and he also delights in publicly humiliating them. Because of this, the townspeople started calling him ''"El Zorro"'' due to his foxlike cunning and charm. Zorro is an [[acrobat]] and an expert in various weapons, but the one he employs most frequently is his [[rapier]], which he uses often to carve the initial "Z" on his defeated foes, and other objects to "sign his work". He is also an accomplished rider, his trusty steed being a black horse called [[Tornado (horse)|Tornado]].

Zorro is the [[secret identity]] of '''Don Diego de la Vega''' (originally '''Don Diego Vega'''), a young man who is the only son of Don Alejandro de la Vega, the richest landowner in California, while Diego's mother is dead. In most versions, Diego learned his swordsmanship while at university in [[Spain]], and created his masked alter ego after he was unexpectedly summoned home by his father because California had fallen into the hands of an oppressive dictator. Diego is usually shown living with his father in a huge {{lang|es|[[hacienda]]}}, which contains a number of secret passages and tunnels, leading to a secret cave that serves as headquarters for Zorro's operations and as Tornado's hiding place. In order to divert suspicion about his identity, Diego hides his fighting abilities while also pretending to be a coward and a [[fop]].

Zorro made his debut in the 1919 novel ''[[The Curse of Capistrano]]'', originally meant as a stand-alone story. However, the success of the 1920 film adaptation ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' starring [[Douglas Fairbanks]] convinced McCulley to write more Zorro stories for about four decades: the character was featured in a total of five serialized stories and 57 short stories, the last one appearing in print posthumously in 1959, the year after his death. ''The Curse of Capistrano'' eventually sold more than 50&nbsp;million copies, becoming one of the [[List of best-selling books|best-selling books]] of all time. While the rest of McCulley's Zorro stories did not enjoy the same popularity, as most of them were never reprinted until the 21st century, the character also appears in over 40 films and in ten TV series, the most famous being the Disney-produced ''[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]'' series of 1957–1959, starring [[Guy Williams (actor)|Guy Williams]]. Other media featuring Zorro include stories by other authors, audio/radio dramas, comic books and strips, stage productions and video games.

Being one of the earliest examples of a fictional masked avenger with a double identity, Zorro inspired the creation of several similar characters in pulp magazines and other media, and is a precursor of the [[superheroes]] of American comic books, with [[Batman]] drawing particularly close parallels to the character.

== Publishing history ==
[[File:Capistrano2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Zorro's debut in the novel ''[[The Curse of Capistrano]]'' (1919).]]
Zorro debuted in [[Johnston McCulley]]'s novel ''[[The Curse of Capistrano]]'', serialized in five parts between August 9 and September 6, 1919, in the [[pulp magazine]] ''[[All-Story Weekly]]''.<ref name=lat>{{cite news |last=Beale |first=Lewis |title=Zorro still makes his mark |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jun/28/entertainment/et-zorro28 |access-date=October 18, 2017 |date=June 28, 2005}}</ref> The story was originally meant as a standalone tale, and at the [[denouement]], Zorro's true identity is revealed to all.

[[Douglas Fairbanks]] and [[Mary Pickford]], on their [[honeymoon]], selected the story as the inaugural picture for their new studio, [[United Artists]], beginning the character's cinematic tradition.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The novel was adapted as the film ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1920), which Fairbanks produced, co-wrote and starred in as Diego/Zorro. The movie was a commercial success,<ref name=lat /> and the 1924 reprint of McCulley's story by publisher [[Grosset & Dunlap]] used the same title, capitalizing on the movie's popularity. The novel has since been reprinted using both titles.

In response to public demand fueled by the film, McCulley wrote more than sixty more Zorro stories, beginning in 1922 with ''The Further Adventures of Zorro'', which was also serialized in ''Argosy All-Story Weekly''. Fairbanks picked up the movie rights for the sequel that year. However, Fairbanks's sequel, ''[[Don Q, Son of Zorro]]'' (1925), was more based on the 1919 novel ''Don Q's Love Story'' by the mother–son duo Kate Prichard and [[Hesketh Hesketh-Prichard]], than ''The Further Adventures''. Thus McCulley received no credit on the film.<ref name=ths>{{cite book |last=Henderson |first=Stuart |title=The Hollywood Sequel: History & Form, 1911–2010 |publisher=British Film Institute |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jtYtDwAAQBAJ&q=The+Further+Adventures+of+Zorro+%281922%29&pg=PA23 |date=2014 |page=23 |isbn=978-1-84457-843-6}}</ref>

At first, production of new Zorro stories proceeded at irregular intervals: the third novel, ''Zorro Rides Again'' (not to be confused with the 1937 theatrical serial) was published in 1931, nine years after the second one. Then, between 1932 and 1941, McCulley wrote four short stories and two serialized novels. Zorro stories were published much more frequently between 1944 and 1951, a period in which McCulley published 52 short stories with the character for the ''West Magazine''. "Zorro Rides the Trail!", which appeared in ''Max Brand's Western Magazine'' in 1954, is the last story to be published during the author's lifetime, and the second-to-last story overall. The last, "The Mask of Zorro" (not to be confused with the 1998 film), was published posthumously in ''Short Stories for Men'' in 1959. These stories [[Retroactive continuity|ignore]] Zorro's public revelation of his identity.

''The Curse of Capistrano'' eventually sold more than 50&nbsp;million copies, becoming [[List of best-selling books|one of the best-selling books of all time]]. For the most part, McCulley's other Zorro stories remained overlooked and out-of-print until the 21st century. Bold Venture Press collected all McCulley's Zorro stories ''Zorro: The Complete Pulp Adventures'', in six volumes.

Over 40 Zorro titled films were made over the years, including ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'', the 1940 classic starring [[Tyrone Power]]. The character was also featured in ten TV series, the most famous being the Disney-produced ''[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]'' series of 1957–59, starring [[Guy Williams (actor)|Guy Williams]].<ref name=lat /> Zorro appears in several stories written by other authors, comics books and strips, stage productions, video games and other media. McCulley died in 1958, just as Zorro was at the height of his popularity thanks to the Disney series.

==Fictional character biography==
[[File:The Mark of Zorro (1920) - 3.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Douglas Fairbanks]] in the first Zorro film, ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1920), which was instrumental in the early success of the character]]

In ''[[The Curse of Capistrano]],'' Señor Zorro became an outlaw in the [[Pueblo de Los Angeles|pueblo of Los Angeles]] in [[California]] "to avenge the helpless, to punish cruel politicians, to aid the oppressed" and is dubbed the "Curse of Capistrano". The novel features extensively both Don Diego Vega and Zorro, but the fact that they are the same person is not revealed to the reader until the end of the book. In the story, both Diego and Zorro romance Lolita Pulido, an impoverished noblewoman. While Lolita is unimpressed with Diego, who pretends to be a passionless [[fop]], she is attracted to the dashing Zorro. The main villain is Captain Ramon, who also has his eyes on Lolita. Other characters include Sgt. Pedro Gonzales, Zorro's enemy but Diego's friend; Diego's deaf and mute servant Bernardo; his ally, Fray (Friar) Felipe; his father Don Alejandro Vega, the richest landowner in California and a widower; Don Carlos Pulido and his wife, Doña Catalina, Lolita's parents; and a group of noblemen ({{lang|es|caballeros}}) who, at first, hunt Zorro but are then won over to his cause.

In later stories, McCulley introduces characters such as pirates and Native Americans, some of whom know Zorro's identity.

In McCulley's later stories, Diego's surname became de la Vega. In fact, the writer was wildly inconsistent. The first magazine serial ended with the villain dead and Diego publicly exposed as Zorro. But in the sequel, the villain was alive and the next entry had the double identity still secret.

Several Zorro productions have expanded on the character's exploits. Many of the continuations feature a younger character taking up the mantle of Zorro.

McCulley's stories are set during the era of [[Spanish California]] (1769–1821)<ref>{{cite web |title=The Legacy of the Fox: A Chronology of Zorro |url=http://www.pjfarmer.com/woldnewton/Zorro.htm |access-date=July 27, 2013}}</ref> and, although exact years are often vague, the presence of the Pueblo of Los Angeles means the stories cannot happen before 1781, the year it was founded. Some media adaptations of Zorro's story have placed him during the later era of [[History of California#Mexican period (1821 to 1846)|Mexican California]] (1821–1848).

==Character motifs==
[[File:Zorroandbernardo.jpg|thumb|left|Zorro ([[Guy Williams (actor)|Guy Williams]]) and Bernardo ([[Gene Sheldon]]) in [[Walt Disney]]'s 1957–1959 ''[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]'' television series]]

The character's visual motif is typically a black costume with a black flowing [[Spanish cloak]] or cloak, a black flat-brimmed hat known as [[sombrero cordobés]], and a black sackcloth [[mask]] that covers the top half of his head. Sometimes the mask is a two piece, the main item being a blindfold-type fabric with slits for the eyes, and the other item being a bandana over the head, so that it is covered even if the hat is removed: this is the mask worn in the movie ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1920) and in the television series ''[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]'' (1957–1959). Other times, the mask is a one piece that unites both items described above: this mask was introduced in ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1940) and appears in many modern versions. Zorro's mask has also occasionally been shown as being a rounded [[domino mask]], which he wore without also wearing a bandana. In his first appearance, Zorro's cloak is purple, his hat is generically referred to as a "wide sombrero," and his black cloth veil mask with slits for eyes covers his whole face. Other features of the costume may vary.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

His favored weapon is a [[rapier]], which he also uses to often leave his distinctive mark, a Z cut with three quick strokes, on his defeated foes and other objects to "sign his work". He also uses other weapons, including a [[bullwhip]] and a [[pistol]].

The [[fox]] is never depicted as Zorro's emblem. It is used as a metaphor for the character's wiliness, such as in the lyrics "Zorro, 'the Fox', so cunning and free{{nbsp}}..." from [[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Disney's television series]] theme.

His heroic pose consists of rearing on his horse, [[Tornado (horse)|Tornado]], often saluting with his hand or raising his sword high. The logo of the company Zorro Productions, Inc. uses an image of Zorro rearing on his horse, sword raised high.

==Skills and resources==
[[File:Zorroridesagain.jpg|thumb|Poster for the serial ''[[Zorro Rides Again]]'' (1937), starring [[John Carroll (actor)|John Carroll]] as a descendant of the original Zorro]]

Zorro is very [[intelligent]] and can not only use a complex strategy, prepared before entering the battlefield, but also improvise plans in the moment of danger and combat. He never uses brute force and, indeed, more often than not he uses humor and psychological teasing to irritate his opponents, causing them to lose their emotional detachment and become too eager for revenge to be able to coordinate in action and in combat. He fools them by provoking them into his traps.

In addition to having exceptional tactical skills, he specializes in infiltrating heavily guarded enemy structures or territories, espionage and improvised explosive devices. His calculating and precise ability as a tactician allowed him to also use weapons as an extension of his skillful hand. He is also a weapons expert and a master of escape and camouflage. He is also good at deciphering numerous languages, both spoken and written. Zorro also masters body language, gestures and symbols, facilitating communication with locals regardless of ethnicity or language.

Zorro is an agile athlete and [[acrobat]], using his bullwhip as a gymnastic accoutrement to swing through gaps between city roofs, and is very capable of landing from great heights and taking a fall. Although he is a master swordsman and marksman, he has more than once demonstrated his prowess in unarmed combat against multiple opponents. Keen intelligence and an acute power of observation are two main skills allowing Zorro to surprise, in order to defeat, establishment enemies.

His calculating and precise dexterity as a tactician has enabled Zorro to use two key weapons, his sword and bullwhip, as an extension of his deft hand. He never uses brute strength. Instead and more likely, he uses his fox-like and sly mind, and well-practiced technique to outmatch an opponent. He uses seduction as Zorro and coyness as Don Diego de la Vega, tricking his opponents to obstruct easy access to his true identity by using deception as masterful skill.

In some versions, Zorro keeps a medium-sized dagger tucked in his left boot for emergencies. He has used his cape as a blind, a trip-mat and a disarming tool. Zorro's boots are also sometimes weighted, as is his hat, which he has thrown, Frisbee-style, as an efficiently substantial warning to enemies. But more often than not, he uses psychological mockery to make his opponents too angry to be coordinated in combat.

Zorro is a skilled horseman. The name of his jet-black horse has varied through the years. In ''The Curse of Capistrano'', it was unnamed. In Disney's ''[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]'' television series the horse gets the name [[Tornado (horse)|Tornado]], which has been kept in many later adaptations. In most versions, Zorro keeps Tornado in a secret cave, connected to his {{lang|es|[[hacienda]]}} with a system of secret passages and tunnels.

McCulley's concept of a band of men helping Zorro is often absent from other versions of the character. An exception is ''[[Zorro's Fighting Legion]]'' (1939), starring [[Reed Hadley]] as Diego. In Douglas Fairbanks' version, he also has a band of masked men helping him. In McCulley's stories, Zorro was aided by a deaf-mute named Bernardo. In Disney's ''Zorro'' television series, Bernardo is not deaf but pretends to be, and serves as Zorro's secret agent. He is a capable and invaluable helper for Zorro, sometimes wearing the mask to reinforce his master's charade. [[The CBN Family Channel|The Family Channel]]'s ''[[Zorro (1990 TV series)|Zorro]]'' television series replaces Bernardo with a teenager named Felipe, played by [[Juan Diego Botto]], with a similar disability and pretense. In Isabel Allende's ''Zorro: A Novel,'' Bernardo is the child of the de la Vega's Native housemaid, Ana, who forms a bond with Regina de la Vega, a former Native warrior who is converted, Christainized and married to Don Alejandro. Their dual pregnancies result in them giving birth the same night. Due to complications from birth, Regina cannot breastfeed her child, Diego, so Ana breastfeeds both boys, making them milk brothers. The two are shown to be inseparable, which helps Bernardo receive more formal education, and accompanies Diego to Barcelona. After a group of pirates invade the de la Vega home, Bernardo witnesses the rape and murder of his mother and a result stops speaking. Diego's grandmother White Owl concludes Bernardo refuses to speak as a form of mourning. He is shown to speak to Tornado in a spirit quest and later to a fellow native girl, Light-in-the-Night, whom he marries.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Zorro gip.jpg|thumb|Zorro ([[Reed Hadley]]) in the serial ''[[Zorro's Fighting Legion]]'' (1939)]]

In ''The Curse of Capistrano'', Diego is described as "a fair youth of excellent blood and twenty-four years, noted the length of [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]] for his small interest in the really important things of life." It is also said that "Don Diego was unlike the other full-blooded youths of the times. It appeared that he disliked action. He seldom wore his blade, except as a matter of style and apparel. He was damnably polite to all women and paid court to none.&nbsp;... Those who knew Don Diego best declared he yawned ten score times a day." Though proud as befitting his class (and seemingly uncaring about the lower classes), he shuns action, rarely wearing his sword except for fashion, and is indifferent to romance with women. This is, of course, a sham. At the end of the novel, Diego explains that he has planned his double identity since he was fifteen:

<blockquote>"It began ten years ago, when I was but a lad of fifteen," he said. "I heard tales of persecution. I saw my friends, the {{lang|es|frailes}}, annoyed and robbed. I saw soldiers beat an old native who was my friend. And then I determined to play this game."

"It would be a difficult game to play, I knew. So I pretended to have small interest in life, so that men never would connect my name with that of the highwayman I expected to become. In secret, I practiced horsemanship and learned how to handle a blade—"

"By the saints, he did," Sergeant Gonzales growled.

"One half of me was the languid Don Diego you all knew, and the other half was the Curse of Capistrano I hoped one day to be. And then the time came, and my work began."

"It is a peculiar thing to explain, {{lang|es|señores}}. The moment I donned cloak and mask, the Don Diego part of me fell away. My body straightened, new blood seemed to course through my veins, my voice grew strong and firm, fire came to me! And the moment I removed cloak and mask I was the languid Don Diego again. Is it not a peculiar thing?"</blockquote>

This part of the backstory was changed in the 1920 film ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'': Diego is recently returned from [[Spain]] at the start of the movie, and Zorro later tells Lolita that he learnt his swordsmanship in Spain. The 1925 sequel ''[[Don Q, Son of Zorro]]'' expands on this concept by saying that: "Though the home of the De Vegas has long been on California soil, the eldest son of each new generation returns to Spain for a period of travel and study." The 1940 film ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' keeps the idea of Diego learning his swordsmanship in Spain, and adds the idea of him being unexpectedly summoned home by his father Don Alejandro when California fell into the hand of an oppressing dictator. Both ideas would then be included in most retelling of the character's backstory.

McCulley's portrayal of Diego's personality, with minor variations, is followed in most Zorro media.

A notable exception to this portrayal is Disney's ''[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]'' (1957–59), where Diego, despite using the original façade early in the series, instead becomes a passionate and compassionate crusader for justice and simply masquerades as "the most inept swordsman in all of California". In this show, everyone knows Diego would love to do what Zorro does, but thinks he does not have the skill.

The Family Channel's ''[[Zorro (1990 TV series)|Zorro]]'' (1990–1993) takes this concept further. While Diego pretends to be inept with a sword, the rest of his facade is actually exaggerating his real interests. Diego is actually well-versed and interested in art, poetry, literature, and science. His facade is pretending to be interested in only these things and to have no interest in swordplay or action. Zorro also has a well-equipped laboratory in his hidden cave in this version of the story.

In Isabel Allende's novel, Diego is a mestizo, the son of a Spanish aristocrat and a Shoshone warrior woman. Thus, as a child, Diego is caught between the divine right of nobility and the ways of his Native mother, grandmother and ancestorrs.

==Inspirations==
The historical figure most often associated with the Zorro character is [[Joaquin Murrieta]], whose life was fictionalized in an 1854 [[dime novel]] by [[John Rollin Ridge]]. In the 1998 film ''[[The Mask of Zorro]]'' Murrieta's (fictitious) brother Alejandro succeeds Diego as Zorro. As a hero with a secret identity who taunts his foes by signing his deeds, Zorro finds a direct literary predecessor in Sir Percival Blakeney, hero of the ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel|Scarlet Pimpernel]]'' [[pulp magazine|pulp series]] by [[Emma Orczy]].

The character recalls other figures, such as [[Robin Hood]], [[Reynard|Reynard the Fox]], [[Salomon Pico]],<ref>Magill, Frank N. "Magill's Survey of Cinema: Silent Films". Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Salem Press, 1982. and Tompkins, Walker. Decade of the Desperado. Santa Barbara Magazine Vol. 8 No. 4, Santa Barbara. 1982.</ref> [[Manuel Rodríguez Erdoíza]], and [[Tiburcio Vasquez]]. Another possible historical inspiration is [[William Lamport]], an Irish soldier who lived in Mexico in the seventeenth century. His life was the subject of a fictive book by [[Vicente Riva Palacio]]; ''The Irish Zorro'' (2004) is a recent biography. Another is [[Estanislao]], a [[Yokuts]] man who led a revolt against the [[Mission San José (California)|Mission San Jose]] in 1827.

The 1860s, 1880s and 1900s [[penny dreadful]] treatment of the [[Spring-heeled Jack]] character as a masked avenger may have inspired some aspects of Zorro's heroic persona.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lulu's review of Spring Heeled Jack |url=https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4011794356}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-KdOnIqfz1cC&q=spring-heeled+jack+as+masked+avenger%2F%2Fwikispeedia%2Fwpcd%2Fwp%2Fs%2FSpring+Heeled+Jack.htm&pg=PA117 |title=The Legend of Spring-heeled Jack: Victorian Urban Folklore and Popular Cultures - Karl Bell - Google Livres |isbn=9781843837879 |accessdate=2022-09-30|last1=Bell |first1=Karl |year=2012 }}</ref> Spring Heeled Jack was portrayed as a nobleman who created a flamboyant, masked [[alter ego]] to fight injustice, frequently demonstrated exceptional athletic and combative skills, maintained a hidden lair and was known to carve the letter "S" into walls with his rapier as a calling card.

Like Sir Percy in ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]]'', Don Diego avoids suspicion by playing the role of an effete [[dandy]] who wears lace, writes poetry, and shuns violence. The all-black Fairbanks film costume, which with variations has remained the standard costume for the character, was likely adapted from the Arrow serial film character [[The Masked Rider (1919 film)|''The Masked Rider'']] (1919). This character was the first Mexican black-clad masked rider on a black horse to appear on the silver screen. Fairbanks's costume in ''The Mark of Zorro'', released the following year, resembled that of the Rider with only slight differences in the mask and hat.<ref>[http://www.serialsquadron.com/dvds/maskedrider/ The Masked Rider] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111122432/http://www.serialsquadron.com/dvds/maskedrider/ |date=January 11, 2016}} The Serial Squadron</ref>

In [[1860]] [[Mór Jókai]] published his novel "''Szegény Gazdagok''" (Poor richmen), where the main character is the [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] Baron Lénárd Hátszegi, who is supposed to have the alterego of the "Fatia Negra" (The one with the Black face), an outlaw who robs local people during the night, and during the day lives an aristocratic life. The novel's character was inspired by the real life [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] Baron László Nopcsa (1794–1884), who according to the local legends had a similar type of alterego.<ref name="mórjókai">{{cite web|url=http://epa.oszk.hu/00000/00001/00366/pdf/itk_EPA00001_1991_05-06_505-542.pdf|title=Maurus Jókai's novels in English translation (in Hungarian but with an abstract in English at the end) by Judit Kádár (in ''Irodalomtörténeti Közlemények'' "Bulletins in Literary History"}}</ref>

===Toys===
Due to the popularity of the Disney TV series, in 1958, [[The Topps Company]] produced an 88-card set featuring stills from that year's movie. The cards were rare and became collectors' items. In the same year the [[Louis Marx]] company released a variety of Zorro toys such as hats, swords, toy pistols and a [[playset]] with the Lido company also making plastic figures.

A major toy line based on the classic Zorro characters, motifs and styling, was released by Italian toy giant, [[Giochi Preziosi]], master toy licensees of the property. The toy range was developed by [[Pangea Corporation]] and released worldwide in 2005 and featured action figures in various scales, interactive playsets and roleplaying items. New original characters were also introduced, including Senor Muerte, who served as a foil to Zorro.

In 2007, Brazilian toymaker Gulliver Toys licensed the rights to ''[[Zorro: Generation Z]]'', which was co-developed by [[BKN]] and [[Pangea Corporation]]. The toy range was designed concurrent and in association with the animated program.

In 2011, US-based collectibles company Triad Toys released a 12-inch Zorro action figure.

[[File:Zorro 2008 01 cover.jpg|right|thumb|150px|''Zorro'' #01, 2008, by Dynamite Entertainment]]
Zorro has appeared in many different comic book series over the decades. In ''Hit Comics'' #55, published by [[Quality Comics]] in November 1948, Zorro is summoned by [[Kid Eternity]], but in this version has only a whip and does not wear a mask.<ref>[http://comicbookplus.com/?dlid=14674 Hit Comics #55] Comic Book Plus</ref>

[[Dell Comics]] published Zorro in ''[[Four Color|Four Color Comics]]'' #228 (1949), 425 (1952), 497 (1953), 538 (1954), 574 (1954), 617 (1955) and 732 (1957). These stories featured artwork by [[Everett Raymond Kinstler]] (#497, 538, and 574), Bob Fujitani, Bob Correa and [[Alberto Giolitti]].<ref>{{Google books|n6zIngEACAAJ|title=Zorro: The Complete Dell Pre-Code Comics|page=|plainurl=}}</ref>

Dell also had a licence to publish [[Disney comics]] in the United States and, following the launch of Disney's ''[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]'' TV series in 1957, published seven more issues of ''Four Color'' dedicated to Zorro between February 1958 and September 1959, under said licence, with the first stories featuring artwork by [[Alex Toth]].<ref>[http://coa.inducks.org/issue.php?c=us/OS++882#01 One Shots No. 882] INDUCKS</ref> In December 1959, Dell started the publication of a standalone Disney-licensed ''Zorro'' title, which started the numeration at #8 and continued to be published until issue #15 (September 1961). The character then appeared in four stories published in the monthly ''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]'' (also published by Dell), one story per issue from #275 (August 1963) to #278 (November 1963): these were the last Zorro stories produced in the United States under the Disney licence. However, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] produced more stories from 1964 to 1978 through the [[Disney Studio Program]], a unit producing comic book stories exclusively for foreign consumption.<ref>[https://inducks.org/comp2.php?code=S&keyw=&keywt=i&exactpg=&pg1=&pg2=&bro2=&bro3=&exactparts=&parts1=&parts2=&kind=nk&rowsperpage=0&columnsperpage=0&hero=&xapp=Zorro&univ=&xa2=&creat=&creat2=&plot=&plot2=&writ=&writ2=&art=&art2=&ink=&ink2=&excludeCZ=on&pub1=&pub2=&ser=&xref=&mref=&xrefd=&repabb=&repabbc=al&imgmode=0&vdesc2=on&vdesc=en&vus=on&sort1=s.firstpublicationdate Disney Studio stories featuring Zorro] at the [[INDUCKS]].

[[Gold Key Comics]] started another Disney-licensed ''Zorro'' series in January 1966, but, like their contemporaneous [[Lone Ranger]] series, it featured only material reprinted from the earlier Dell comics, and folded after 9 issues, in March 1968. The character remained dormant in the United States for the next twenty years until it was revived by [[Marvel Comics]] in 1990, for a 12-issue tie-in with the [[Duncan Regehr]] television series ''[[Zorro (1990 TV series)|Zorro]]''. Many of these comics had Alex Toth covers.

In 1993 [[Topps Comics]] published a 2-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''Dracula Versus Zorro'' followed by a ''Zorro'' series that ran 11 issues. Topps also published two limited series of ''Lady Rawhide'', a spin-off from the Zorro stories created by writer [[Don McGregor]] and artist Mike Mayhew.<ref>{{cite web |last=Johnston |first=Rich |title=The Return Of Lady Rawhide |website=Bleeding Cool |url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/05/15/the-return-of-lady-rawhide/ |date=May 15, 2013 |access-date=May 31, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Lady Rawhide |website=An International Catalogue of Superheroes |url=http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/l/ladyrawhide.htm/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819163643/http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/l/ladyrawhide.htm |date=May 15, 2013 |access-date=May 31, 2013 |archive-date=August 19, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Lady Rawhide |website=Comics Vine |url=http://www.comicvine.com/lady-rawhide/4005-46821// |date=May 15, 2013 |access-date=May 31, 2013}}</ref> McGregor subsequently scripted a limited series adaptation of ''[[The Mask of Zorro]]'' film for [[Image Comics]].

A newspaper daily and Sunday strip were also published in the late 1990s. This was written by McGregor and rendered by [[Tom Yeates]]. [[Papercutz]] once published a Zorro series and graphic novels as well. This version is drawn in a [[manga]] style.

[[Dynamite Entertainment]] relaunched the character with a 20-issue ''Zorro'' series which ran from 2008 to 2010, written by [[Matt Wagner]] and drawn by multiple artists. The publisher also released an earlier unpublished tale called "Matanzas" by [[Don McGregor]] and artist Mike Mayhew. Zorro (here a 1930s descendant) also appears in the 2013 Dynamite eight-issue limited series ''Masks'' alongside the [[Green Hornet]] and [[Kato (The Green Hornet)|Kato]], [[The Shadow]], and [[Spider (pulp fiction)|The Spider]]. It was written by [[Chris Roberson (author)|Chris Roberson]] with art by [[Alex Ross]] and [[Dennis Calero]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Masks |work=www.comicvine.com |year=2013 |url=http://www.comicvine.com/masks/4050-54311/ |access-date=November 6, 2013}}</ref>

Dynamite Entertainment also published a seven-issue series titled ''Django/Zorro'' between November 2014 and May 2015, teaming Zorro with the character Django Freeman from [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s movie ''[[Django Unchained]]'' (2012). The series was co-written by Tarantino and Matt Wagner, with art by Esteve Polls.<ref>{{cite web |title=Django / Zorro |url=https://www.dynamite.com/htmlfiles/viewProduct.html?CAT=DF-Django_Zorro |access-date=January 8, 2018}}</ref>

In 2018, American Mythology took the license, launched the series ''Zorro Legendary Adventures'', written by Jean-Marie Nadaud and drawn by Robert Rigot<ref>[https://www.bleedingcool.com/2018/05/23/zorro-and-edgar-rice-burroughs-return-in-american-mythology-august-2018-solicits/ Zorro and Edgar Rice Burroughs Return in American Mythology August 2018 Solicits]</ref> and limited series ''Zorro: Swords of Hell'', written by David Avallone and illustrated by Roy Allan Martinez.<ref>[https://icv2.com/articles/news/view/40239/zorro-takes-supernaturalZorro takes on the supernatural]</ref> The company has since released crossovers featuring Zorro with their other licensed properties, namely ''Zorro in the Land that Time Forgot'' featuring Diego De La Vega accompanying an expedition to the lost world of [[Caspak]] from the [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] novels.

===Music===
On the commercial release of the ''[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]'' 1957 Disney TV series' Zorro theme, the lead vocal was by [[Henry Calvin]], the actor who played Sergeant Garcia on the program. The song was written by [[Jimmie Dodd]].

[[The Chordettes]] sang the single version of the song, complete with the "Sounds of the Z" and the clip clopping of Zorro's horse, which is heard at the song's end. The song hit Number 17 in 1958 according to the Billboard Charts.

In 1964, [[Henri Salvador]] sang "Zorro est arrivé." It tells from a child's point of view how exciting it is whenever a villain threatens to kill a lady in the television series. But every time again, to his relief, the "great and beautiful" Zorro comes to the rescue. An early music video was made at the time.

[[Alice Cooper]]'s 1982 album ''Zipper Catches Skin'' includes the song "Zorro's Ascent" which is about Zorro facing his death.

The 1999 song "El Corona" by [[Suburban Legends]] tells the story of "Don Diego", the "hombre en negro" ("man in black"), a "tall Spaniard with a sharp sword" who was "down and out in LA" and defending the people from an unnamed corrupt ruler.

==Copyright and trademark disputes==
The [[copyright]] and [[trademark]] status of the Zorro character and stories have been disputed. Most of the entries of the Zorro franchise are still protected by copyright, and many hundreds of copyrights are owned or controlled by Zorro Productions, Inc. but there are at least five exceptions: the 1919 novel ''The Curse of Capistrano'', the 1920 film ''The Mark of Zorro'', the 1922 novel ''The Further Adventures of Zorro'', the 1925 film ''Don Q, Son of Zorro'' and the 1926 film ''In the Way of Zorro'' are in the [[public domain]] in the United States since at least 95 years have passed after their first release. Zorro Productions, Inc. asserts that it "controls the worldwide trademarks and copyrights in the name, visual likeness and the character of Zorro."<ref>[http://www.zorro.com/about.html "About Zorro Productions Inc."] page from the company's web site</ref> It further states "[t]he unauthorized, unlicensed use of the name, character and/or likeness of 'Zorro' is an infringement and a violation of state and federal laws."<ref>[https://www.zorro.com/featured-products "Features Products"] page from the company's web site.</ref>

In 1999, [[TriStar Pictures]], a division of [[Sony Pictures]], sued Del Taco, Inc., due to a fast-food restaurant advertising campaign that allegedly infringed Zorro Productions' claims to a trademark on the character of Zorro. Sony and TriStar had paid licensing fees to Zorro Productions, Inc., related to the 1998 film ''[[The Mask of Zorro]]''. In an August 1999 order, the court ruled that it would not invalidate Zorro Productions' trademarks as a result of the defendant's arguments that certain copyrights in Zorro being in the public domain or owned by third parties.<ref>{{cite web |title=TriStar vs Del Taco 1999 |work=Scribd |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/239326856/TriStar-vs-Del-Taco-1999}}</ref>

[[File:FairbanksMarkofZorro.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1920), starring [[Douglas Fairbanks]], is out of copyright]]

A dispute took place in the 2001 case of ''Sony Pictures Entertainment v. Fireworks Ent. Group.''<ref>[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17573994030226630518&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr "Sony Pictures Entertainment v. Fireworks Ent. Group."] at [[Google Scholar]], retrieved December 4, 2010.</ref> On January 24, 2001, Sony Pictures, TriStar Pictures and Zorro Productions, Inc. sued [[Fireworks Entertainment]], [[Paramount Pictures]], and [[Mercury Entertainment]], claiming that the ''[[Queen of Swords (TV series)|Queen of Swords]]'' television series infringed upon the [[copyright]]s and [[trademark]]s of Zorro and associated characters. ''Queen of Swords'' is a 2000–2001 television series set in [[Alta California|Spanish California]] during the early 19th century and featuring a hero who wore a black costume with a red sash and demonstrated similarities to the character of Zorro, including the sword-fighting skills, use of a whip and [[bolas]], and horse-riding skills.

Zorro Productions, Inc., argued that it owned the copyright to the original character because Johnston McCulley assigned his Zorro rights to Mitchell Gertz in 1949. Gertz died in 1961, and his estate transferred to his children, who created Zorro Productions, Inc. Fireworks Entertainment argued that the original rights had already been transferred to [[Douglas Fairbanks, Sr.]] in 1920 and provided documents showing this was legally affirmed in 1929, and also questioned whether the copyright was still valid.

The court ruled that "since the copyrights in ''The Curse of Capistrano'' and ''The Mark of Zorro'' lapsed in 1995 or before, the character Zorro has been in the public domain".<ref>[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17573994030226630518&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr#r&#91;31&#93; Note 31] of ''Sony Pictures Entertainment v. Fireworks Ent. Group.''</ref> Judge Collins also stated that: "Plaintiffs' argument that they have a trademark in Zorro because they licensed others to use Zorro, however, is specious. It assumes that ZPI had the right to demand licenses to use Zorro at all." Judge Collins subsequently vacated her ruling following an unopposed motion filed by Sony Pictures, TriStar Pictures and Zorro Productions, Inc.<ref>Order Granting Unapposed Motion to Vacate Previous Interlocutory Orders Pursuant to Settlement – Sony Pictures Entertainment v. Fireworks Ent. Group, November 4, 2002, Case No 01-00723 (ABC) (JWJx), US District Court for the Central District of California.</ref>

In another legal action in 2010, Zorro Productions, Inc., sued [[Mars, Incorporated]], makers of [[M&M's]] chocolate candies, and ad agency [[BBDO|BBDO Worldwide]] over a commercial featuring a Zorro-like costume.<ref>{{cite web |title=Zorro Complaint |work=Scribd |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/29031180/Zorro-Complaint}}</ref> The case was settled ("each party shall bear its own costs incurred in connection with this action, including its attorney's fees and costs") on August 13, 2010.<ref>http://dockets.justia.com/docket/california/candce/3:2010cv01179/225493/ |Zorro Productions v Mars Inc. and BBDO worldwide</ref>

In March 2013, Robert W. Cabell, author of ''Z – the Musical of Zorro'' (1998), filed another lawsuit against Zorro Productions, Inc. The lawsuit asserted that the Zorro character is in the public domain and that the trademark registrations by Zorro Productions, Inc., are therefore fraudulent.<ref>http://de.scribd.com/doc/130370303/Zorro |Robert Cabell v. Zorro Productions, Inc.</ref> In October 2014, Cabell's lawsuit was dismissed, with the judge ruling that the state of Washington (where the case was filed) did not have jurisdiction over the matter.<ref>{{cite web |title=LEGAL 21178242v1 72 Judgment – Court |work=Scribd |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/244018343/LEGAL-21178242v1-72-Judgment-Court}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Judge Nixes Playwright's Bid to Free 'Zorro' From Intellectual Property Grip |magazine=The Hollywood Reporter |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/judge-nixes-playwrights-bid-free-744883 |date=October 29, 2014}}</ref> However the judge later reversed his decision and had the case transferred to California.<ref>{{cite news |title=Judge Revives 'Zorro' Rights Fight After Reconsidering Earlier Ruling (Exclusive) |magazine=The Hollywood Reporter |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/judge-revives-zorro-rights-fight-770477 |date=February 5, 2015}}</ref> In May 2017, U.S. District Judge Davila granted Zorro Productions, Inc.'s motion to dismiss Cabell's claim to cancel its federal trademark registrations.<ref>Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Deffendant's Motion to Dismiss, Robert Cabell v.

In June 2015, Robert W. Cabell's legal dispute with Zorro Productions, Inc. resulted in the [[Community Trade Mark]] for "Zorro" being declared invalid by the European Union's Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market for goods of classes 16 and 41.<ref>{{cite magazine |title="Zorro" Trademark Declared Invalid in Europe |magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/zorro-trademark-declared-invalid-europe-806823 |date=July 6, 2015}}</ref> This follows the 'Winnetou' ruling of the Office's First Board of Appeal<ref>{{cite web |title=Winnetou Ruling |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/293035053/Winnetou-Ruling}}</ref> in which the Board of Appeal ruled that the name of famous characters cannot be protected as a trademark in these classes. Zorro Productions appealed the decision and, on December 19, 2017, the EUIPO Fourth Board of Appeal nullified the lower court's ruling, declaring the contested trademarks as valid, and required Cabell to pay the costs of the legal action, the appeal and Zorro Productions' legal fees and costs{{Citation needed|date=January 2022}}.

==Legacy==
[[File:MaskedRider.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Texas Tech University|Texas Tech]]'s [[The Masked Rider]]]]

The 1936 film ''[[The Vigilantes Are Coming]]'' features a masked vigilante with a costume similar to Zorro, which led several countries to name the movie after Zorro: the film was named ''Zorro l'indomptable'' in France, ''Zorro – Der blutrote Adler'' in Germany, ''Zorro – den blodrøde ørn'' in Denmark and ''Zorro – veripunainen kotka'' in Finland. The main character is played by [[Robert Livingston (actor)|Robert Livingston]], who would then play the actual Zorro in the movie ''[[The Bold Caballero]]'', also released in 1936.

[[The Masked Rider]], the primary [[mascot]] of [[Texas Tech University]], is similar to Zorro. Originally called "Ghost Rider", it was an unofficial mascot appearing in a few games in 1936 and then became the official mascot with the 1954 Gator Bowl.

Being one of the earliest examples of a fictional avenger with a double identity, Zorro inspired the creation of several similar characters in pulp magazines and other media, and is a precursor of the [[superheroes]] of American comic books, [[Jerry Siegel]] has credited Zorro along with [[The Scarlet Pimpernel]] as one of the inspirations for the creation of [[Superman]] particularly the concept of his dual identity as mild mannered reporter Clark Kent, as Clark Kent's harmless facade and dual identity were inspired by the protagonists of such movies as Don Diego de la Vega in ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' and Sir Percy Blakeney in ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]]'', Siegel thought this would make for interesting dramatic contrast and good humor.<ref>Jerry Siegel, quoted in {{harvp|Andrae|1983}}: "I loved ''The Mark of Zorro'', and I'm sure that had some influence on me.  I did also see ''The Scarlet Pimpernel'' but didn't care much for it."</ref><ref>Jerry Siegel. ''Creation of a Superhero'' (unpublished memoir, written c.1978; Scans available from [https://www.dropbox.com/s/k3rb8by5oupsjhz/Creation%20of%20a%20Superhero%20by%20Jerry%20Siegel.pdf?dl=0 Dropbox] and [https://www.scribd.com/document/382800890/Creation-of-a-Superhero-by-Jerry-Siegel Scribd]{{Dead link|date=October 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}).:<br />"In movies, I had seen "The Scarlet Pimpernel", "The Mark of Zorro" and Rudolph Valentino in "The Eagle", and I thought that a mighty hero, who in another identity pretended to be an ineffectual weakling, made for great dramatic contrast. In addition, it would, in a comic strip, permit some humorous characterization."</ref> Superman's stance as the ''Champion of the Oppressed'' and devil-may-care attitude during his early Golden Age appearances were influenced by the characters of ''The Mark of Zorro'' star Douglas Fairbanks, who starred in similar adventure films such as ''[[Robin Hood (1922 film)|Robin Hood]]''.<ref>{{harvp|Andrae|1983}}: "... I was inspired by the movies.  In the silent films, my hero was Douglas Fairbanks Senior, who was very agile and athletic.  So I think he might have been an inspiration to us, even in his attitude.  He had a stance which I often used in drawing Superman. You'll see in many of his roles—including Robin Hood—that he always stood with his hands on his hips and his feet spread apart, laughing—taking nothing seriously."</ref>

Also being one of the earliest examples of a fictional masked avenger with a dual identity, [[Bob Kane]] has credited Zorro as part of the inspiration for the character [[Batman]], which was created in 1939.<ref>Boichel, Bill. "Batman: Commodity as Myth." The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and His Media. Routledge: London, 1991. {{ISBN|0-85170-276-7}}, pp. 6–7</ref> Like Don Diego de la Vega, Bruce Wayne is [[affluent]], the heir of wealth built by his parents. His everyday persona encourages others to think of him as shallow, foolish and uncaring to throw off suspicion. [[Frank Miller]]'s comic book miniseries ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'' (1986) and ''[[The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'' (2001–2002) both include multiple Zorro references like the Batman inscribing a Z on a defeated foe. In later tellings of Batman's origins, Bruce Wayne's parents are murdered by a robber as the family leaves a showing of the 1940 film ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'', starring [[Tyrone Power]].

Zorro inspired a similar pulp character known as [[El Coyote (fictional character)|El Coyote]], which was created in 1943 by José Mallorquí. A sample superhero character called The Fox appearing in the ''[[GURPS Supers|Supers]]'' supplement of the [[GURPS|GURPS role-playing system]] is also based on Zorro.

The 1954 ''[[Man with the Steel Whip]]'' [[Republic Pictures|Republic]] serial features a masked hero similar to Zorro, called El Latigo. Republic had previously released five Zorro serials between 1937 and 1949, but had since lost the licence for the character and could not use him anymore. The serial makes frequent use of [[stock footage]] from all five Zorro serials, with scenes originally showing Zorro now being interpreted as showing El Latigo: the result of this is that the costume and body shape of El Latigo keeps changing between scenes, even becoming female in scenes taken from ''[[Zorro's Black Whip]]'' (1944).<ref name="GMS">{{cite book | last1 = Harmon | first1 = Jim | author1-link = Jim Harmon | author2 = [[Donald F.

The 1956 musical comedy ''[[The Court Jester]]'' features a masked freedom fighter called The Black Fox (played by [[Edward Ashley-Cooper|Edward Ashley]]) who combines aspects of both Zorro and [[Robin Hood]].

Hanna-Barbera Productions' animated series ''[[Pixie and Dixie and Mr. Jinks]]'' (1958–1961) featured a Zorro-like character with a mask, cape and sword known in the episode "Mark of the Mouse" (1959). Hanna-Barbera Production's animated series ''[[The Quick Draw McGraw Show]]'' (1959–1962) features El Kabong, an alternate persona of the main character [[Quick Draw McGraw]], which is loosely based upon Zorro.

In the animated series ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' (2001–2004), a DC Comics character, [[El Diablo (comics)|El Diablo]], bears a striking similarity to Zorro, in that he wears the same style hat, mask, sash and cape. The main difference is that his primary weapon is a whip. The Lazarus Lane version of El Diablo appears in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' (2004–2006), voiced by [[Nestor Carbonell]]. While designed after his comic appearance, elements from Zorro's appearance were added in. Seen in the episode "[[The Once and Future Thing (Justice League Unlimited)|The Once and Future Thing]]" (2005), he appears alongside [[Pow Wow Smith]], [[Bat Lash]] and [[Jonah Hex]].

In 2015, The M7 Con Western Convention, held at the [[Los Angeles Convention Center]] featured a segment on the history of Zorro in film and television. The presentation focused on the great Zorro actors including [[Douglas Fairbanks]], [[Tyrone Power]], [[Guy Williams (actor)|Guy Williams]], and [[Duncan Regehr]]. Maestro Ramon Martinez and actor [[Alex Kruz]] gave a live demonstration of the [[Spain|Spanish]] style of fencing known as La Verdadera [[Destreza]]. The two dueled live as Zorro and the Comandante much to the delight of the crowd.<ref>{{cite web |title=M7 Con 2015 Alex Kruz Appears As Zorro |url=http://zorro-swashbucklingnewsandupdates.blogspot.com/2015/12/m7-con-2015-alex-kruz-appears-as-zorro.html |date=December 19, 2015}}</ref>

A cave that was used as a filming location in various Zorro productions is now known as "Zorro's Cave" and remains in place, now hidden behind a condominium complex, on land that was once the [[Iverson Movie Ranch]] in [[Chatsworth, Los Angeles, California|Chatsworth, Calif.]], recognized as the most widely filmed outdoor shooting location in the history of Hollywood.

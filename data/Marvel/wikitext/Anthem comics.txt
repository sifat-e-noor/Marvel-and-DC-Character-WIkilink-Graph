{{short description|Group of fictional characters}}
'''The Order''' is the name of two [[fictional character|fictional]] [[superhero]] teams appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The first team was a brief offshoot of the team [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], and the second is part of an [[Fifty State Initiative|initiative]] to place a superhero team in each [[U.S. state|state]] of the [[United States]].

==Publication history==
===Defenders offshoot===
The original incarnation of The Order starred in the six-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''The Order'' (April-Sept. 2002) intending to conquer the world in order to protect it.<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=264}}</ref> The team consisted of the original Defenders: [[Doctor Strange]], [[Hulk|The Incredible Hulk]], [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] and [[Silver Surfer]].

===Initiative version===
A second Marvel Comics superhero team called The Order debuted in ''The Order'' vol. 2, #1 (Sept. 2007), created by writer [[Matt Fraction]] and penciler [[Barry Kitson]]. Following the fallout of  Marvel Comics' [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] crossover event, The Order was dubbed the ''First Super Hero Team of Tomorrow''<ref>{{cite web|title=Marvel's The Champions becomes The Order|url=http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.1159.The_Order_%231|publisher=[[Marvel.com]]|date=6 June 2007|access-date=2008-02-29}}</ref> being the official superhero team for [[California]] as part of the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Fifty States Initiative]]. The group was originally intended to be named The [[Champions (1975 team)|Champions]],<ref name="CW6"/> before it was revealed that the [[trademark]] was owned by [[Hero Games#Hero Comics and Hero Graphics|Heroic Publishing]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Marvel's The Champions becomes The Order|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=115267|publisher=[[Newsarama]]|date=4 June 2007|access-date=2007-06-05}}</ref> and were first seen during the end of the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] with many of its members going unnamed during their first appearances. However, most would be a part of the new series though the designs of the characters were slightly altered.

As the cast of The Order is composed almost entirely of new characters, Fraction looked to a popular TV drama for ideas on how to acquaint readers with his protagonists.

{{blockquote|I kind of went with the same kind of format they use on ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]''. Each issue, I wanted readers to spend a little time with one character more than any other.}}

Fraction framed each issue around a flashback sequence depicting an interview with each character explaining their past and why they joined the Order to give each character a detailed introduction.<ref name="CBR">{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=12169 | title=comicbookresources Article|access-date=2007-12-03}}</ref>

In late January 2008, Fraction revealed on [[Newsarama]]'s podcast "Word Balloon" that ''The Order'' would end at issue 10.<ref>{{cite web|title=WORD BALLOON: MATT FRACTION|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=144015|publisher=[[Newsarama]]|date=7 February 2008|access-date=2008-02-21}}</ref> Though at first it was believed that Marvel had canceled the series, Fraction later stated on a later Newsarama interview that

{{blockquote|That the book wasn't cancelled: I chose to end it. Marvel allowed me to choose to leave the stage, rather than to continue on in a state in which I felt was compromised and decidedly unawesome.

I don't think I was too clear about that on Word Balloon: it wasn't cancelled. I killed it. And if you're looking for the man that killed The Order, it was me.<ref>{{cite web|title=MATT FRACTION ON THOR: AGES OF THUNDER|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=145906|publisher=[[Newsarama]]|date=22 January 2008|access-date=2008-02-21|quote='''NRAMA''': Do you have anything you'd like to say about the book's cancellation or future plans for the characters?<br>'''MF''': That the book wasn't cancelled: I chose to end it. Marvel allowed me to choose to leave the stage, rather than to continue on in a state in which I felt was compromised and decidedly unawesome.<br>I don't think I was too clear about that on Word Balloon: it wasn't cancelled. I killed it. And if you're looking for the man that killed The Order, it was me.<br>Now watch, nobody's gonna read that and nobody's gonna care, because it's way more fun the other way. Oh well.}}</ref>}}

Though the series was ended several of the book's characters and storylines would continue on in Matt Fraction's next project ''[[The Invincible Iron Man (comics)|The Invincible Iron Man]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Man of Iron: Writer finds dream job â€” at Marvel Comics|url=http://deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,695277450,00.html?pg=2|publisher=deseretnews.com|date=9 May 2008|access-date=2008-05-14|quote=There are a few themes and story threads from 'The Order' that will be addressed in 'Invincible Iron Man'}}</ref> The group also appeared in the 2008 ''[[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]]'' series and ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #18.

The team is largely made up of celebrities known for making a difference through charitable work, and through a process involving a viral genomech payload developed by [[Hank Pym]] each one is given superpowers modeled on the pantheon of [[Greek gods]] and trained at a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] base in [[Arizona]].<ref name="CW6">''Civil War'' #6</ref> However, this process causes great strain on human bodies allowing the users limited time as superhuman (roughly a year).<ref name="TO1">''The Order'' vol. 2, #1 (Sept. 2007).

The group, then known as the Champions, were first put to use in the final battle of the superhuman [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]].<ref name="CW7">''Civil War'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> Though unnamed, the group that went into the fight consisted of people that closely resembled Hercules, Pierce, Maul, an [[African-American]] Avona, Bannerman Brown & Green, Corona along with several others displaying a variety of different powers.

The team would come into conflict with various villains, most with a connection to General Softly<ref name="TO6">''The Order'' vol. 2, #6 (Feb 2008). Marvel Comics.</ref> and the mysterious "M.A.N. from S.H.A.D.O.W." military group, including hordes of Zobos (mechanized [[zombie]] [[hobos]]), Cold War supervillains, Gamma monsters, [[Namor]], and an all girl gang called the Black Dahlias who have been given superpowers via the same process as The Order by M.A.N. from S.H.A.D.O.W. as well as deal with a murder case involving a former Order member.

The team is later evicted from its [[Bradbury, California]] headquarters<ref name="CBR"/> and the M.A.N. from S.H.A.D.O.W. is revealed to be a collection of General Softly androids first devised by the Super Human Development and Operation (S.H.D.O.), an early attempt at a Fifty State Initiative from fifty years before; around the time of the real General Samuel Softly's death, and now part of a collection of villains (including Black Dahlias and Maul) led by [[Zeke Stane|Ezekiel Stane]], the son of [[Iron Man]] enemy [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]], who have set out to destroy The Order.<ref name="TO8">''The Order'' vol. 2, #8 (April 2008). Marvel Comics.</ref> After Stane reactivates Mulholland Black's powers to the point of them going out of control and depowering the rest of The Order, Henry Hellrung was forced to kill Mulholland.

The villains defeated, Tony Stark offers to repower the surviving members of The Order permanently and turn the team into a military operation rather than a public relations showcase. The Order will continue on as the Initiative superhero team of California.<ref name="TO10">''The Order'' vol. 2, #10 (April 2008). Marvel Comics.</ref> During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'', The Order was one of the two Initiative teams that the invading [[Skrull]]s were unable to place a sleeper agent on as the team was chosen by Tony Stark personally rather than Criti Noll, the Skrull impostor of [[Hank Pym]].<ref name="ATI18">''Avengers: The Initiative'' #18. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, suspicions arose also between the members of the Order and almost culminated into a fight.

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, representatives of the Order are called by [[Prodigy (Ritchie Gilmore)|Prodigy]] when the Initiative is restarted and briefed on the hammers that the [[Serpent (comics)|Serpent]] summoned to Earth.<ref>''Fear Itself: Youth in Revolt'' #1.

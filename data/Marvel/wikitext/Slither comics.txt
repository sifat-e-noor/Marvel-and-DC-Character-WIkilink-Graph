==Fictional team history==
The [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] was the founder of the original [[Brotherhood of Mutants#Magneto's Brotherhood|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]. Over the years, the original Brotherhood had disbanded, so Magneto decided to create a new Brotherhood. He recruited five young mutants and trained them to become the new Brotherhood. The five mutants were sent to capture [[Mr. One & Mr. Two|Mister One]], a mutant who was small enough to enter and operate a miniature spacecraft Magneto had discovered. Their plans were foiled by [[Captain America]] and Magneto left the team.<ref>''Captain America'' Annual #4 (1977)</ref>

Their next employer, the [[Mandrill (comics)|Mandrill]], renamed the team Mutant Force, a name they would commonly be associated with.<ref>''The Defenders'' #78 (December 1979)</ref> As Mutant Force the team repeatedly came into conflict with the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. During this period they were employed by both the US government and the [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]]. [[Peepers (Marvel Comics)|Peeper]], the usual leader, was absent for their first mission with the Secret Empire.<ref>''The Defenders'' #125</ref> As Secret Empire operatives, they were led by [[Mad Dog (Marvel Comics)|Mad Dog]].

The [[Red Skull]] offered the team funding and renamed them the Resistants. As the Resistants, the team fought against the [[Registration acts (comics)#Mutant Registration Act|Mutant Registration Act]]. During this time, [[Slither (comics)|Slither]] wasn't part of the team, but many mutants joined the team including [[Mist Mistress]] and [[Mentallo]] (now calling himself ''Think Tank''). As the Resistants, the team would fight against several superheroes, including their original enemy Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' #343 (July 1988)</ref> Eventually most members would leave. Slither rejoined and the team retook the name Mutant Force.<ref>''The New Warriors'' vol. 2, #6</ref> The team disbanded shortly afterwards, most members going their own way.

After the events of "[[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]", some members of the Mutant Force have been depowered while others maintained their mutant abilities.

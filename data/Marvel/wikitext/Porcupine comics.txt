'''Alexander Gentry''' was originally a scientist who worked as a weapons designer for the [[United States Army]]. He conceived the idea of designing a battlesuit in imitation of a [[porcupine]]: it would be covered with quill-like projections for defense. Moreover, it would be able to shoot its quills, or gases, flames, chemicals, paralysis-inducing pellets, or weapons from quill-like tubes, at an opponent. Gentry spends months working overtime to create his porcupine battlesuit. He is proud of his achievement when the suit was finished, and believes his invention is worth a fortune. Yet Gentry also believes that the government would pay him, one of its employees, virtually nothing for his creation. Angrily, Gentry decides to keep the porcupine battlesuit and to use it to become wealthy through crime. Thus Gentry became the Porcupine, one of the first costumed professional criminals of his generation. [[Hank Pym]], the Ant-Man, and his partner, Janet van Dyne, the [[Wasp (character)|Wasp]], soon defeat the Porcupine when he attempts to rob a bank.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #48. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, the Porcupine escapes. After Pym had also assumed the superhuman powers and identity of Giant-Man, Porcupine returns for revenge. During the resulting battle, the Porcupine consumes what he thinks is a Giant-Man growth serum, but which instead shrinks him to microscopic size.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #53. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Eventually, the capsules' effect wore off, and the Porcupine, again at his normal size, is among the many costumed menaces assembled by [[Doctor Doom]] to disrupt the wedding of [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] and [[Invisible Woman|Susan Storm]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' Annual #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

His self-confidence still shaken by his failures in battling Giant-Man and the Wasp, the Porcupine eagerly accepts the invitation of [[Count Nefaria]], a powerful figure in the criminal [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]], to join his group of costumed agents. Among Nefaria's agents are [[Plantman]], the original [[Eel (comics)|Eel]], the original [[Unicorn (Marvel Comics)|Unicorn]], and the [[Scarecrow (Marvel Comics)|Scarecrow]], all of whom the Porcupine would ally himself with in the future as well. The Porcupine and the other costumed agents aid Count Nefaria in his attempt to hold much of [[Washington D.C.]] for ransom. However, the [[X-Men]] thwart Nefaria and his agents.<ref>''X-Men'' #22-23. Marvel Comics.</ref> Once again, the Porcupine escapes being taken prisoner, and he blames the failure of the blackmail scheme on Nefaria and the other agents. Gentry comes to suspect that in fact he himself was inadequate for the role of being a "super-villain" battling superhuman opponents.

Porcupine enlists as a member of [[Batroc the Leaper|Batroc]]'s Brigade. As a Brigade member, the Porcupine unsuccessfully battles [[Captain America]].<ref>''Captain America'' #130. Marvel Comics.</ref> Months later, the Porcupine and his allies, Plantman, the original Eel and the Scarecrow, go to work for the masked criminal mastermind the Cowled Commander on his crime spree. Once again, the Porcupine clashes with Captain America and is defeated.<ref>''Captain America'' #158-159. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Convinced that they are failures, Gentry and Leopold Stryke, the original Eel, seek guidance from the Celestial Mind Control movement, which is secretly masterminded by the alien [[Nebulon (comics)|Nebulon]]. Nebulon pits the Porcupine and the Eel against his foes, the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], who defeat them both.<ref>''The Defenders'' #37-38. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Porcupine is then employed by the android [[Zodiac (comics)#Zodiac II|Zodiac]] to participate in a crime spree.<ref>''The Defenders'' #63-64. Marvel Comics.</ref> Porcupine is then employed by [[Justin Hammer]] to battle [[Iron Man]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #127. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, the Porcupine and a small group of confederates invade a major Manhattan hotel to steal the valuables in its safe. The Porcupine decides to rob the wealthy attendees at a fashion show in one of the hotel's ballrooms. The show is being given by Janet van Dyne. Hank Pym, who now uses the costumed identity of Yellowjacket, is also present, as is Kyle Richmond, the adventurer [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]]. The heroes swiftly defeat the criminals. Porcupine feels humiliation at being taken down by opponents the size of insects.<ref>''The Avengers'' #167. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Porcupine next turns up as one of a large assemblage of costumed criminals organized by the original versions of Libra and Sagittarius of the android Zodiac. This time the Porcupine is defeated by [[Hellcat (comics)|Hellcat]] during a battle between a number of the criminals and a group of adventurers operating under the auspices of the Defenders.<ref>''The Defenders'' #62-64</ref>

The Porcupine goes to prison but is soon released by minions of Justin Hammer. The Porcupine agrees to provide Hammer with half the proceeds from his criminal activities in exchange for Hammer's financial support. The Porcupine is among the small army of costumed criminals whom Hammer sends to attack Iron Man when the latter turned up on Hammer's enormous "houseboat" headquarters. Iron Man defeats all of these criminals. Porcupine is soon fired by Hammer.<ref>''The Defenders'' #126-127. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Tired of his long string of defeats, Gentry decides to give up his career as a costumed criminal and live off the millions of dollars he expects to receive by selling his battlesuit. Gentry totally redesigns his porcupine battlesuit, making it far deadlier than before. He enters into negotiations with the subversive organization called the [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]] to sell them the suit. The Empire requests proof of the battlesuit's capabilities, so Gentry attempts to prove it in battle against Captain America. Captain America and his ally Nomad defeat the Porcupine, and Gentry is returned to jail.<ref>''Captain America'' #285. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In prison, Gentry vows never to be defeated again, and to ensure that he decides never to put on the Porcupine battlesuit again. Gentry is soon released from prison, and he sets about once more to try to sell the battlesuit. He fails to find any serious buyers. Gentry tries to sell it to the Secret Empire but is attacked by Nomad.{{issue|date=May 2012}}

When most of the heroes were missing due to them partaking in the [[Beyonder]]'s [[Secret Wars]], Porcupine joins Batroc and some other villains in fighting [[Moon Knight]] and [[Guardsman (comics)|Guardsman]].<ref>''Code of Honor'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Porcupine later joins a short-lived version of the [[Lethal Legion]] in their mass-attack on New York's superheroes. He is knocked aside by a thrown printer and hit by a stray blast from Unicorn.<ref>''Marvel Age'' Annual #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Gentry then tries to sell the suit to [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]], [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]], the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]], the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]], the [[Tinkerer]], and finally to the [[Serpent Society]], but almost no one wants it, and the few offers he does receive for it are insultingly low. Despairing, Gentry comes up with the idea of selling the battlesuit to the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] to prevent it from falling into the hands of their enemies. Captain America is intrigued when Gentry mentions he contacted the Serpent Society, whom Captain America has been trying to bring to justice. Captain America agrees to have the Avengers buy the battlesuit if Gentry helps get him to members of the Serpent Society. Gentry accepts Captain America's terms. Captain America's plan is for Gentry to pretend to have captured him and offer the Serpent Society the opportunity to kill him. Gentry contacts the Society and arranges to have some of their members meet him at a lower Manhattan construction site. When the trap is sprung, in the ensuing melee Gentry trips and inadvertently impales himself fatally on one of his quills. Captain America has Gentry buried in a grave reserved by the Avengers for those who have fallen in battle and puts his battlesuit on exhibit in [[Avengers Mansion]], labeled "Battle Armor of the Porcupine – Honored Foe of the Avengers".<ref>''Captain America'' #315. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Porcupine pops up as one of the character witnesses for [[Trapster]]'s lawsuit against [[Tinkerer (Marvel Comics)|Tinkerer]]. During the in-court brawl, [[She-Hulk]] notices Porcupine and reminds him that he is supposed to be dead. Realizing She-Hulk is right, Porcupine drops dead.<ref>''The Sensational She-Hulk'' #59 (January 1994). Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The original Porcupine designed a suit of battle armor for himself composed of steel and advanced plastics that enhanced his strength and durability. The armor is equipped with a wide variety of offensive and defensive weapons built in. The outer surface of the armor is covered with razor-tipped metal quill-like projections which can be fired at opponents. The armor's other capabilities include laser beams, concussive bombs, small rockets, tear gas, sleeping gas, smoke screens, acetylene torch flames, liquid cement, wheels giving off hypnotic lights, and high voltage blasts of electricity. The battlesuit included belt jets which allowed him to fly for short distances. Gentry was a skilled automotive mechanic and had a master's degree in engineering.

The second Porcupine's armor gives him some resistance to physical and energy attacks. The helmet has a 6-hour air supply and night vision lenses. The quills do damage when striking opponents. His boot jets allow him to fly for up to 10 minutes. The Porcupine can fire three bombs or three knock out gas bombs at once.

Billy's offensive morphing power allowed him to sprout razor tipped spikes from his face, body, and right arm. These spikes were retractable, distorting the skin tissue to appear as acne. He could fire these spikes as projectile bolts with lethal force. Billy could also distort his left arm into a misshapen, extended form with elongated fingers and claws.

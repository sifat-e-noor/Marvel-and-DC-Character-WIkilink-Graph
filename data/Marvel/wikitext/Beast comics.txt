'''Beast''' ('''Dr. Henry Philip''' "'''Hank'''" '''McCoy''') is a [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]] and is a founding member of the [[X-Men]]. Originally called "The Beast", the character was introduced as a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] possessing ape-like superhuman physical strength and agility, oversized hands and feet, a [[genius]]-level intellect, and otherwise normal appearance and speech. Eventually being referred to simply as "Beast", Hank McCoy underwent progressive physiological transformations, gaining animalistic physical characteristics. These include blue fur, both [[simian]] and [[felidae|feline]] facial features, pointed ears, fangs, and claws. Beast's physical strength and [[sense]]s increased to even greater levels.

Despite Hank McCoy's feral appearance, he is depicted as a brilliant, well-educated man in the arts and sciences, known for his [[wit]]ty sense of humor, and characteristically uses barbed witticisms with long words and intellectual references to distract his foes.<ref name="back29">{{cite journal|last=Boney|first=Alex |title=The Beauty of the Beast: Marvel's First Break-Out Mutant|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=29 |pages=17–24|date=August 2008}}</ref> He is a world authority on [[biochemistry]] and [[genetics]], the X-Men's [[physician|medical doctor]], and the [[science]] and [[mathematics]] instructor at the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]] (the X-Men's headquarters and school for young mutants). He is also a mutant [[political activist]], campaigning against society's [[bigotry]] and [[discrimination]] against mutants. While fighting his own bestial instincts and fears of social rejection, Beast dedicates his physical and mental gifts to the creation of a better world for man and mutant.

One of the original X-Men, Beast has appeared regularly in X-Men-related comics since his debut. He has also been a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].

The character has also appeared in media adaptations, including animated TV series and feature films. In ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'' (2003), [[Steve Bacic]] portrayed him in a very brief cameo in his human appearance while in ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' (2006) the character had a larger role and was played by [[Kelsey Grammer]]. [[Nicholas Hoult]] portrayed a younger version of the character in ''[[X-Men: First Class]]'' (2011). Both Hoult and Grammer reprised their roles in ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' (2014). Hoult also reprised the role in ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'' (2016) and ''[[Dark Phoenix (film)|Dark Phoenix]]'' (2019), and had a cameo in ''[[Deadpool 2]]'' (2018).

==Publication history==
Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-writer [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #1 ([[1963 in comics#September|September 1963]]). Stan Lee writes in the [[foreword]] to ''X-Men: The Ultimate Guide'' that he made Beast the most articulate, eloquent, and well-read of the X-Men to contrast with his brutish exterior. Further, the book opines that the [[Werner Roth (comics)|Werner Roth]]–[[Roy Thomas]] team garnered admiration for their "appealing and sensitive characterizations of the original X-Men". Roth, under the alias Jay Gavin, had taken over for Kirby fully by issue #18, and Thomas was a new talent. Beast was given an individualized, colorful new costume, along with the rest of the X-Men by issue #39 in order to attract new readers. During [[Jim Steranko]]'s tenure, which added "exciting art", Roth returned, working with [[Neal Adams]] who blended Kirby's style with "realism, idealized beauty, and epic grandeur".

In ''Amazing Adventures'' #11 (March 1972), written by [[Gerry Conway]], Beast underwent a radical change and mutated into his now familiar furry, blue (originally grey) appearance. The concept originated with Roy Thomas, an effort to make the character more visibly striking, and Beast also became more werewolf-like to capitalize on the success of ''[[Werewolf by Night]]''.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} [[Steve Englehart]], who wrote the remainder of the Beast's short-lived spotlight in ''Amazing Adventures'', emphasized the character's wit rather than the tragedy of his transformation into a more monstrous form, reasoning that the Beast's intelligence and sense of humor would allow him to see his misfortune in perspective.<ref name="back29"/> Over the next decade the Beast would appear on the roster of several teams in titles ranging from ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' to ''[[The Defenders (comic book)|The Defenders]]'' to ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]''. It was not until 1991, in ''X-Factor'' #70/''X-Men'' #1, that the Beast finally returned to the X-Men.

Englehart later said that he added the Beast to the Avengers roster because he wanted to write the character again and thought his funny, down-to-earth personality would make him a good foil for [[Moondragon]].<ref name="back29"/> Succeeding writers of ''The Avengers'' similarly found that the character's lightheartedness made a good balance to the team's generally serious tone, resulting in the Beast's run in ''The Avengers'' outlasting his earlier run in ''X-Men''.<ref name="back29"/> His friendship with fellow Avenger [[Wonder Man]] would likewise come to eclipse his friendship with X-Man [[Iceman (Marvel Comics)|Iceman]] for the comics fandom.<ref name="back29"/> ''The Avengers'' #137 (July 1975) debuted the Beast's [[catchphrase]], "Oh, my stars and garters,"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Boney|first=Alex |title=Stars and Garters: A Collection of Beast's Best|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=#29 |page=23|date=August 2008}}</ref> and ''The Avengers'' #164 (October 1977) was the first to depict him as a [[sex symbol]], a take which writer [[Jim Shooter]] said resulted in very positive mail from female readers in particular.<ref name="back29"/>

Beast cured the [[Legacy Virus]] in ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #390 (2001), and in ''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'' #3 (2001) he experienced a further mutation into a [[Felidae|feline]] being, first shown in the introduction to ''[[New X-Men (2001 series)|New X-Men]]'' (June, 2001), by [[Frank Quitely]] and [[Grant Morrison]]. As evidenced on the back cover of ''X-Treme X-Men'' [[Chris Claremont]], writer of that series in addition to both ''The Uncanny X-Men'' (for sixteen consecutive years) and ''X-Factor'', contributed much to the Beast's characterization. Citing Claremont as inspiration for his run on ''New X-Men'', Morrison explains Beast as a "brilliant, witty bipolar scientist". Morrison continues, "I saw Henry McCoy as an incredibly clever, witty, cultured, well-traveled, experienced, well-read character so I brought out those parts of his personality which seemed to me to fit the profiles of the smartest and most worldly people I know—his sense of humor is dark and oblique. He's obviously quite clearly bipolar and swings between manic excitement and ghastly self-doubt. He has no dark secrets, however, and nothing to hide."<ref>''[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=2707 The End of an X-Era]''</ref>

[[Joss Whedon]]'s "[[Astonishing X-Men]]: Gifted" story arc featured a "mutant cure" designed by Indian Benetech scientist Dr. [[Kavita Rao]], and the prospect of "real" humanity arouses the interest of a heavily mutated Beast, who visits Rao only to discover that the drug is the product of illegal human experimentation on an unknown victim. The idea of a mutant cure, which had previously appeared in the 1992 animated series, was also the basis of the ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' movie plot and the series was even made into a [[motion comic]]. IGN called the arc focusing on Beast "best X-Men run in a decade" and lauded Whedon for flawless character dynamics.<ref name="ign1">[http://uk.comics.ign.com/articles/709/709053p1.html Astonishing X-Men HC, Vol. 1 Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611140149/http://uk.comics.ign.com/articles/709/709053p1.html |date=2012-06-11 }}</ref> According to ''[[BusinessWeek]]'', Beast is listed as one of the top ten most intelligent fictional characters in American comics.<ref>{{cite web | last = Pisani | first = Joseph | author-link = Joseph Pisani | title = The Smartest Superheroes | publisher = www.businessweek.com | year = 2006 | url = http://images.businessweek.com/ss/06/05/smart_heroes/index_01.htm | access-date = 2007-11-25| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071203062918/http://images.businessweek.com/ss/06/05/smart_heroes/index_01.htm| archive-date= 3 December 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>

Beast appeared as a regular character throughout the 2010–2013 ''Secret Avengers'' series, from issue #1 (July 2010) through its final issue #37 (March 2013).

==Fictional character biography==
===Youth===
Henry Philip "Hank" McCoy was born in Dundee, [[Illinois]], in the [[United States]], to Norton and Edna McCoy. His father, Norton McCoy, is employed at a local nuclear power plant before Henry's birth and was once exposed to intense [[Radioactive decay|nuclear radiation]], which appears to have caused his son's mutation. Hank is born with a vast intellect, unusually long arms and legs, and unusually large hands and feet—a rare although not unique case of mutant powers manifesting before puberty.<ref>{{cite news|title=Letter Rip!|work=[[Marvel Age]]|issue=#54|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=September 1987|page=30}}</ref> His bodily proportions are comparable to those of a gorilla, and later stories reveal his nickname in school was "[[Magilla Gorilla]]".

===With the X-Men===
Henry's mutation more fully manifests during adolescence, providing greater strength and agility, and although his powers allow him to briefly excel in athletics during his remaining time at school, he soon attracts the animosity of his fellow students and other non-mutant humans. As he seeks refuge, he is approached by [[Professor Charles Xavier]], who invites him to study at [[X-Mansion|Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Henry recognizes the opportunities such an institution can offer him and accepts the invitation. He finds the school both a fountain of scientific knowledge and a place of sanctuary. There he is introduced to the X-Men, who accept him into their ranks and give him the codename Beast. Alongside workouts in the [[Danger Room]], under Xavier's tutelage, he studies subjects ranging from [[differential equation]]s to [[Proust]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

With the rest of the X-Men on their first field mission, he battles [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] for the first time,<ref>[[Lee, Stan]] (w), [[Kirby, Jack]] (p), [[Reinman, Paul]] (i).

Marvel Comics (New York City).</ref> He became stressed because he had to keep a secret identity while in the X-Men team, so he briefly left the team to become a professional wrestler. While he was a professional wrestler he met [[Unus the Untouchable]], and helped the X-Men build a [[directed-energy weapon]] to make Unus completely untouchable, resulting in Unus not being able to feed himself.<ref name="XM8">Lee, Stan (w), Kirby, Jack (p), Stone, Charles (i).

===Furry change and team trading===
Hank is the first to leave the X-Men. He becomes a research scientist at the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Brand Corporation]], a genetics research facility. His assistant, Linda Donaldson, becomes his girlfriend. Hank isolates a "hormonal extract" allowing anyone to become a mutant for a short period of time, and uses the mutagenic serum on himself to disguise his appearance while foiling an attempt to steal his research. He waits too long to reverse the process, leaving him permanently transformed.<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' vol. 2 #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> He grows grey fur, which later turns blue, all over his body and acquires pointed ears, elongated canine teeth, claws, the ability to run on walls and ceilings like a spider, enhanced senses, an accelerated healing factor, and a feral side he struggles to control. He briefly joins the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants when [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]] wipes out his memory, but quickly recovers. When Beast is wounded, he is aided by [[Patsy Walker]], and then reunited with his old girlfriend, Vera Cantor. He fears that his furry form will repulse others,<ref name="amazing"/> but finds that many women are attracted to his hirsuteness.<ref name="xftv1no54">{{Cite comic |Artist=Silvestri, Marc |Writer=Simonson, Louise |Coartists=Milgrom, Al |Colorist=Vancata, Brad |Letterer=Rosen, Joe |Editor=Harras, Bob |Story=Crimson |url=https://www.comics.org/issue/47948/ |Title=X-Factor |Volume= |Issue=#54 |Date=May 1990 |Publisher=Marvel Comics |accessdate=2021-07-24}}</ref> Back at Brand Laboratories, he discovers his girlfriend Linda Donaldson is an agent of the criminal [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]], and they break up.<ref>''Marvel Adventures'' vol. 2 #12. Marvel Comics (New York City).</ref>

Not long after this transformation, Beast is recruited to join the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] as a provisional member.<ref>''The Avengers'' #137. Marvel Comics.</ref> He is later granted full Avengers membership<ref>''The Avengers'' #151. Marvel Comics.</ref> and remains a member for many years, becoming a close friend of [[Wonder Man]]. He leaves the team periodically to rejoin the X-Men during times of need (such as "[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]"<ref>[[Claremont, Chris]] (w), [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]] (p), [[Austin, Terry]] (i). ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #134–137 (June 1980 – September 1980). Marvel Comics (New York City).</ref>). Beast returns to the Avengers each time, but eventually leaves so that the team, which has a six-member limit at the time, can be filled out by new recruits.<ref name="avengers211">[[Shooter, Jim]] (w), [[Colan, Gene]] (p), [[Dan Green (artist)|Green, Dan]] (i). "... By Force of Mind", ''The Avengers'' #211 (September 1981). Marvel Comics (New York City).</ref>

He later joins the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]],<ref>''The Defenders'' #104. Marvel Comics (New York City).</ref> stays with the team to organize as the "new" Defenders,<ref>''The Defenders'' #125. Marvel Comics (New York City).</ref> and is one of the final surviving members at the time of its first disbandment as a result of the battle with [[Moondragon]] and the [[Dragon of the Moon]].<ref>''The Defenders'' #152. Marvel Comics (New York City).</ref> Beast and fellow surviving Defenders [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] and Iceman are contacted shortly after by [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey]] to form a new group, [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #1. Marvel Comics (New York City).</ref>

===X-Factor===
With X-Factor, Beast rejoins the original members of the X-Men, and is again reunited with Vera Cantor. Beast starts out in his furred form, but on their second mission, he is captured by [[Tower (comics)|Tower]]. He is delivered to Carl Maddicks and used in an attempt to develop a cure for mutancy, which has rendered Maddicks' son, [[Artie Maddicks|Artie]], mute. Maddicks develops a serum based on McCoy's original serum, and tests it on Beast. Hank is also subjected to chemotherapy and radiation, and has a cardiac arrest. X-Factor arrives on the scene and saves Hank, but not before he was injected with the serum. When the bandages around his face are removed, he is revealed to have lost his blue fur.<ref>''X-Factor'' #1–3. Marvel Comics.</ref> This helps in X-Factor's cover as normal humans who are mutant hunters for hire (though they actually help the mutants they capture). When they see the need for their powers, they get new costumes similar to their old X-Men costumes, and call themselves the X-Terminators, posing as renegade mutants. Beast wears a mask as he did originally, since he now looks human again.

Eventually X-Factor clashes with the ancient mutant [[Apocalypse (character)|Apocalypse]]<ref>''X-Factor'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> after Angel loses his wings in a battle and shortly after goes missing. Apocalypse turns Angel into Death, the most powerful of his four [[Horsemen of Apocalypse]]. During the battle, Beast is touched by the Horseman Pestilence, whose touch usually causes incredible pain and viral infection. The infection interacts with the recent serum treatment of Maddicks, and instead of killing him, Hank is affected in such a way that every time he uses his superhuman strength, his intelligence decreases.<ref>''X-Factor'' #24. Marvel Comics.</ref> Though the battle is won, it comes at the cost of Hank's decreasing intelligence and Angel's humanity, which would not return for a time. Hank's condition worsens for weeks. He even openly talks to [[Trish Tilby]], a reporter, not realizing she might use the information on TV. Out of respect for Hank's situation, Trish does not mention his name when she reports about X-Factor's recent battles, only that one of them lost his intellect while heroically defending New York. Beast is still hurt by her using the information at all, but she is able to convince him that she meant well.

X-Factor finally ends their charade and are hailed as heroes, and they then don costumes similar to their previous X-Terminator costumes. When Hank's mind is nothing more than that of a child, he intercepts a mutant called [[Infectia]] who is trying to kiss Iceman. Infectia has the ability to manipulate molecular structures through touch, creating mutated "monsters". When she kisses Beast, he becomes feverish and begins switching back and forth between his normal and furred forms.<ref name="auto">''X-Factor'' #31. Marvel Comics.</ref> Finally, he stabilizes in his furry appearance, keeps his intelligence, and has more strength than ever.<ref>''X-Factor'' #33. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Return to X-Men===
Hank soon resumes wearing his old costume, but now no longer has need for a mask. During the events of ''[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]'', Beast, along with the rest of X-Factor team up with the X-Men and various other heroes to fight the evil forces invading the city; eventually, they manage to stop a portal between [[Limbo (Marvel Comics)|Limbo]] and Earth from remaining open and peace returns for the survivors.<ref>''X-Factor'' #39. Marvel Comics.</ref> Soon after ''Inferno'' ends, the ''[[X-Tinction Agenda]]'' takes place where Genosha wants to punish various mutants for war crimes on their island. Here, Beast plays yet another key role. Shortly after the crisis ends, X-Factor switches costumes once more; Cyclops, Jean, and Iceman all wear identical costumes, while Beast returns to wearing trunks, and [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]] sticks to his old costume he received from Apocalypse.<ref>''X-Factor'' #63. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Towards the end of X-Factor's career, they battle the [[Shadow King]] during the ''[[Muir Island Saga]]''. The final battle leaves Professor Xavier disabled again, which results in X-Factor rejoining the X-Men.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #281, ''X-Men'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Studying the Legacy Virus===
One of Beast's greatest challenges emerges with [[Stryfe]]'s fatal [[Legacy Virus]]. Hank is already despondent, as he is turning thirty and questions his life accomplishments. His frustrations are further compounded when Professor Xavier and [[Moira MacTaggert]] did not ask for his assistance with the Legacy research, but it turns out Xavier is just giving him his privacy. Perusing their data, Hank learns the problem is more difficult than he had initially imagined. Hank has always believed that, given time, he could solve any problem; the Legacy Virus becomes his obsession. He goes as far as making an unethical decision in giving [[Mister Sinister]] information on the virus, since he has more resources and fewer morals to inhibit him.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}

A turning point comes when [[Dark Beast]] finishes some of the formula, occasionally prying more information from Hank whom he imprisoned and replaces for a while.<ref>''X-Men'' #49. Marvel Comics.</ref> The most critical step toward a solution (other than when Beast individually finds the cure without acknowledgement) comes when Dr. MacTaggert discovers [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]'s irresponsible manipulation of virus strains. The cure is incomplete and it takes Beast to design the final cure. Based on Moira's notes, Beast concocts the anti-virus to much elation, but it soon is repaid with a heavy toll—[[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] chooses to sacrifice his life to release the remedy.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #390. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After mourning the loss of a teammate, Hank briefly leaves the school with [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and her [[X-Treme X-Men]] team in search of [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]]'s diaries. After an attack by [[Vargas (comics)|Vargas]] that leaves [[Betsy Braddock|Psylocke]] dead, Beast is gravely injured and returns to the institute.

===Enhanced feline form===
As the world experiences a mutant [[baby boom]], much of the mutant community seemingly begins experiencing "[[secondary mutation]]s", often taking the form of additional or enhanced abilities. In the aftermath of Vargas' attack, Beast's secondary mutation is "jumpstarted" due to the powers of teammate [[Sage (comics)|Sage]]. The further mutation causes Beast to develop a more feline physique, to which he initially has some trouble adapting. A psychic attack by the genocidal [[Cassandra Nova]] leaves Beast humiliated, badly beaten (by the controlled body of his friend [[Barnell Bohusk|Beak]]) and haunted by the possibility that his new form is simply a step in a continuous state of [[devolution (biological fallacy)|devolution]]. Additionally, the alteration in form causes his long-time girlfriend, [[Trish Tilby]], to break up with him after being accused of [[zoophilia|bestiality]] in the media. Over time, Beast strikes up a strong friendship with [[Emma Frost]], in one incident bringing her flowers to cheer her up. He finds her diamond form shattered into thousands of pieces and spends some time putting her back together. With a final jolt of psionic energy from Jean Grey, Frost returns to life.{{Issue|date=May 2012}}

Beast later uncovers what seems to be a female mutant with feline features, like his situation. This raises hopes for him, until he discovers it is not a mutant human that looks like a cat, it is a mutant cat who looks like a human. Either way, the creature is at the limit of her life and Beast allows her to leave the X-Mansion to die quietly in a spot she finds comfortable.<ref>''X-Men Unlimited'' #36. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Astonishing X-Men===
When news of a "cure" that would reverse mutations suddenly arises, Beast finds himself seriously considering taking it so he can once again appear human. Hank eventually decides against it after vigorous "urging" by fellow team member [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], as it would send out a negative message to other mutants if an X-Man were to take the cure. After learning that the cure was developed by fellow geneticist [[Kavita Rao]] through experimentation on mutant corpses—as well as on the revived X-Man Colossus—Beast helps take down Rao's operation. When the villainous [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] attacks the X-Men, Cassandra Nova telepathically strips away Beast's higher human consciousness, leaving him with only his animal instincts. After he hunts Wolverine around campus (and even eats his leg), a student named [[Blindfold (comics)|Blindfold]] faces him down with a device he and Xavier had built in case his consciousness was ever lost. The device is a high-powered sensory stimulant in the form of a ball of string, which Beast had alluded to as being his greatest fear. Once restored, he is quick to put on a suit and tie and help Wolverine with a hyper-magnetic device. He, along with his teammates, are taken from the Mansion by the government agency [[S.W.O.R.D. (comics)|S.W.O.R.D.]] and airlifted to the alien Breakworld.{{Issue|date=May 2012}}

===Civil War===
When a [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] breaks out among Marvel's superheroes, Beast, along with the other X-Men, assumes a neutral stance. Beast was not a particular fan of the policy and secretly violates his stance by providing [[Spider-Man]] with a holographic disguise to enable him to continue teaching at Midtown High after his secret identity has been exposed.<ref>''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref> Despite his personal feelings about the [[Registration acts (comics)|Superhuman Registration Act]], Beast enlists his services to the Initiative program after the war's end, to assist in the training of the next generation of superheroes.<ref name="CivilWar:BDR">{{Comic book reference | Writer = Ronald Byrd, [[Anthony Flamini]] | Penciller = Various | Inker = Various | Story = The Initiative | Title = Civil War: Battle Damage Report | Issue = #1 |date= 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

===Endangered Species===
The X-Men and various other mutants attend the funeral of a young mutant boy named Matt Landru who has been killed in a road traffic accident and muse on what this means for mutant-kind. Beast plans to find a way to reverse [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]]. Despite the 'aid' of his other self (the [[Dark Beast]]), along with exploring such diverse avenues of investigation as analysis of alternate timelines or an attempt to track down the [[Scarlet Witch]], he is unsuccessful in his research, but the final part shows him holding a child wearing a three-eyed smiley face shirt saying "Evolution" on it as a promotion of the ''[[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]]''.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

In the aftermath, Cyclops has sent Beast to search for Professor Xavier, whose status is unknown by the X-Men. Beast is also seen closing down the ruins of the X-Mansion and taking [[Martha Johansson]] with him.<ref>''X-Men Divided We Stand'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Move to San Francisco===
Beast is seen as part of the team setting up a new X-Men headquarters in San Francisco, California. He is working closely with Cyclops, Emma Frost, and the rookie X-Man, [[Armor (comics)|Armor]].

===Second Coming===
Beast later returns in an issue of ''Uncanny X-Men'' to attend the funeral of his friend and teammate, Kurt Wagner ([[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]) where he confronts Scott Summers and blames Kurt's death on Scott's increasingly militant and extremist attitude to protecting the mutant species at all costs (even at the cost of sacrificing his friends to do so).<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #13.

===Accelerated Mutation and Time Travel===
In the aftermath of the Phoenix War, Cyclops now actively strikes out at government organizations and holds mutants prisoner, with the X-Men unwilling to actively fight him as they fear the subsequent mutant civil war that might result. Beast, who is apparently dying due to side-effects of his secondary artificially-accelerated mutation, stumbles upon a solution after a chance comment from Iceman to the effect that the Cyclops they knew when they were young would not tolerate his present self's actions. Beast travels back in time to the early days of the Xavier Institute to bring the original five X-Men from that period into the future, hoping that Scott's past self will be able to convince his present self to stand down.<ref>''All-New X-Men'' #1.

===Death of X and working with Inhumans===

Marvel Comics.</ref> Using Hordeculture's technology, Beast revives Explodey Boy so that he can confront his zombie counterpart.<ref>''Empyre: X-Men'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
It is possible that Beast's mutation is a result of genetic [[atavism]].<ref name="Yaco, Linc, Haber, Karen 2004">{{cite book | authors = Yaco, Linc, Haber, Karen |date=February 2004| title = The Science of the X-Men | publisher = I Books/Marvel | isbn = 978-0-7434-8725-2}}</ref> However, he also possesses [[neotenous]] characteristics, which may explain him having a genius-level intellect despite his animal physique.<ref name="Yaco, Linc, Haber, Karen 2004"/> He also possesses superhuman strength, speed and agility. He is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, employing a unique style of acrobatic combat, from combat training he received at Professor Xavier's and coaching from [[Captain America]].

===Anthropoid/Simian physique===
Originally, Hank McCoy retains the basic features of a normal human alongside a generally [[simian]] physiology (e.g., elongated limbs and enlarged extremities) equivalent to that of a [[hominidae|Great Ape]]. This mutation gives him superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, agility, flexibility, dexterity, coordination, balance, and endurance. Hank is equally dexterous with all four limbs; able to perform tasks with his feet or hands with equal ease. Because of his talents and training, Beast can outperform any [[Olympic Games|Olympic]]-level athlete, contorting his body and performing aerial feats gracefully. His strength and dexterity allow him to climb vertical surfaces with just his hands and/or feet,<ref>''X-Men'' #2, 8, 48, 50, 51, 52. Marvel Comics.</ref> jump great distances<ref name="XM8"/> and survive falls that would kill any ordinary person.<ref>''X-Men'' #48. Marvel Comics.</ref> He also possesses enhanced senses and can track people for great distances over open terrain<ref name="XM10"/> and his feet are sensitive enough to detect electronic signals (from bombs, listening devices, etc.) through solid walls and floors.<ref>''X-Men'' #11, 38. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, he drank an experimental solution of his own making and mutated further through the growth of grey fur covering his entire body and the enhancement of all of his existing abilities, especially his strength, and Hank also gained a nearly instantaneous healing factor.<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #11–14. Marvel Comics.</ref> The psychological impact of this first transformation caused Beast to experience short-term amnesia and also made it difficult for him to control his animalistic instincts, which would cause him to slip into an uncontrollable berserker rage during combat.<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #11–13. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, his body suddenly mutated again after a short time, changing his fur color from grey to black (although comic book printing technology depicted it as blue), returning his strength to previous levels, and losing his healing factor.<ref name="amazing">''Amazing Adventures'' #15. Marvel Comics.</ref> He was also able to more easily control his animal instincts after this second mutation. Beast gained the ability to emit mood altering [[pheromone]]s, causing sexual attraction in women.<!-- I think this was in one of the issues of S.W.O.R.D.-->{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Hank McCoy briefly returned to his human form<ref>''X-Factor'' #3 (1986). Marvel Comics.</ref> with his hair color now being depicted as black, not reddish brown. During this time he was occasionally depicted with claws and fangs, but these were not a part of his original mutation.<ref name="amazing"/> However, as a result of being touched by Pestilence his strength began to increase exponentially while his intellect began to decrease.<ref>''X-Factor'' #19 (1986). Marvel Comics.</ref>

After [[Infectia]]'s kiss restored Hank to his simian physique, his intellect had stabilized and returned to his previous genius-level, and his strength had increased to superhuman proportions.<ref name="auto"/> Beast's fangs and claws became a consistent part of his appearance after this return to his "blue and furry" form.

Beast would later be stabilized to a more human/ape-like form with pointy ears, fangs, and no hair except for the fur on his head.<ref name="ANXM #5"/>

===Feline physique===
After being critically wounded,<ref>''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'' #2–4. Marvel Comics.</ref> Hank's body undergoes a [[secondary mutation]], jump started by [[Sage (comics)|Sage]]. The result is a more [[felidae|feline]] appearance equivalent to that of a [[big cat]] with a cat-like head and feet. His strength, speed, stamina, sturdiness, and senses increase further with this change. He gains catlike agility, flexibility, coordination, and balance, and all his senses are enhanced to twenty times that of a normal human being. In addition, Beast develops an accelerated healing factor that allows him to repair mild to moderate injuries within the span of a few hours. However, as his hands and feet change from simian to feline (going from a normal human set of four fingers to just three, retaining the opposable thumb), he loses his superhuman dexterity, once admitting that he used to play the guitar, but is now learning to play the drums instead. Following the X-Men's relocation to San Francisco, Beast discovers that he had regained some of his old manual dexterity. In the first issue of Warren Ellis' ''Astonishing X-Men'' run, Beast also comments he no longer needs full sleep.{{issue|date=November 2013}}

It is later discovered that his secondary feline mutation is still detrimental to his health: as such, with the combined efforts of past versions of Jean Grey and himself, Beast's condition was stabilized in a more human/ape-like form, possessing blue fur and larger than the average human male but otherwise fairly human.<ref name="ANXM #5"/>

===Genius-level intellect===
Hank possesses a brilliant intellect. He is a world-renowned [[biochemist]], having earned [[PhD]]s in [[Biophysics]] and [[Genetics]],<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #308</ref> and is the man who cured the [[Legacy Virus]]. He frequently functions as both field medic and in-house physician for the X-Men, despite not technically having an MD. His intelligence and expertise in [[genetics]] rival that of [[Professor X]], [[Moira MacTaggert]], and [[Kavita Rao]]. Despite this, he has never received a [[Nobel Prize]] or been elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]]. A [[polymath|Renaissance man]], McCoy is well versed in many fields including [[linguistics]] (fluent in [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Latin]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Arabic]], and [[Russian language|Russian]] as well as the fictional language Latverian<ref name="avengers211"/>), [[literature]], [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[history]], [[art]] and [[art history]], [[anthropology]], [[music]], [[political science]] and [[economics]] with a special affinity for science and technology and a penchant for quoting literary classics including [[Shakespeare's plays]]. His vast scientific knowledge ranges from [[theoretical physics]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[differential equation]]s, [[nanotechnology]], [[anatomy]], [[biomedicine]], [[analytical chemistry]], [[electrical engineering]], and [[mechanical engineering]] to the construction of a hyper-magnetic device. An electronics expert, he often repairs [[Cerebro]] and makes upgrades to the Danger Room settings. He has made several deus ex machina devices on par with Reed Richards, including a device that strips entities of cosmic powers. While not a medical doctor, he was able to perform brain surgery on the [[Red Skull]] to extract the fragment of Charles Xavier's brain that the Skull had grafted onto himself, removing the Skull's telepathic abilities while leaving the villain otherwise apparently healthy.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' vol. 3 #22. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Time-displaced Beast's abilities===
After a meeting with Doctor Strange, the displaced younger Beast has mastered a combination of science and magic, allowing him to return himself and his four teammates to the past for a few minutes, although he notes that it took a great deal of effort to send them back for that long and it merely confirmed that history has been 'reset' so that the displaced X-Men are no longer 'needed' in the past.<ref name="All-New 2 19"/> He has also mastered a mystical portal that allowed him to send the Juggernaut to Siberia after passing through Hell.<ref>''X-Men: Blue'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Similarities==
According to writer [[Will Murray]], a possible inspiration for the Beast was [[List of Doc Savage characters|Andrew Blodgett "Monk" Mayfair]], a companion of pulp hero [[Doc Savage]]. Both are possessed of an apelike appearance and are brilliant scientists. Before becoming more erudite in later issues, McCoy also used a great deal of slang in his early appearances much like Monk.<ref>Murray, Will (April 2004). "Pulp Roots of the X-Men". ''Comic Book Marketplace'' #111.</ref>

The story also featured Beast teaming up with [[Mr. Spock]] to stop an inter-dimensional rift caused by the villain [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|Proteus]]. In a one-page drawing included at the end of the issue, we see Beast and Mr. Spock engaged in a game of chess, with Beast intently studying the chessboard while hanging upside-down from the ceiling.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===Ultimate Marvel===
Henry "Hank" McCoy was not born like a 'blue ape'. He was born with hands instead of feet, he tried to make a substance that would cure his mutation but instead it only made it worse. With his own parents denouncing him throughout his childhood for his genetic status, he chooses to hide his immense intelligence to avoid further complications. Hank becomes a founding member of the [[Ultimate X-Men]] taking the codename Beast. He also takes on the role of the team's elite engineer, frequently upgrading the X-Men's [[Blackbird (comics)|Blackbird X-Jet]] and [[Danger Room]] sequences.{{issue|date=September 2020}}

When the team is kidnapped by Weapon X, they operate on him, causing him to take on his blue furry appearance and gain additional, strengthened senses, such as smell and hearing.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

Beast begins an on again/off again relationship with [[Alternative versions of Storm#Ultimate Storm|Storm]]. Storm loves him very much because of his intelligence, but Beast's inferiority complex often gets in the way of their relationship. He becomes convinced that Storm only loves him because [[Professor X#Ultimate Charles Xavier|Professor X]] is using mind control on her. Beast starts an online relationship that eventually leads to the [[Ultimate War]] debacle, when he lets it slip that [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] is still alive (the supposed mutant "supermodel" Naomi he is chatting with is actually [[Blob (comics)#Ultimate Blob|the Blob]] fishing for information).{{issue|date=February 2013}}

Beast is killed after being crushed under the rubble of a [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] attack.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #45. Marvel Comics.</ref> While his death is felt by all of the X-Men, it has had the greatest impact upon Storm. However, it is revealed that the Beast is revived at the hospital.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #81. Marvel Comics.</ref> Xavier and Nick Fury keep his survival a secret, Xavier making Beast believe he is regularly visiting his family and the X-Men in order to keep him occupied. Having reversed himself back to his normal human appearance (maintaining the blue hair from his former kangaroo kidney transplant, which was independent of Weapon X's modifications), Hank is now working on a cure to a "[[Legacy Virus#Ultimate Legacy Virus|Legacy Virus]]", created by an anti-mutant government conspiracy led by [[William Stryker#Ultimate Marvel|Admiral Stryker]], that threatens mutants. The apparent death of Xavier (actually time travel) breaks the mental holds on him so he knows that everyone thinks he is dead and is not happy being forced to work for [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Beast escapes S.H.I.E.L.D. custody and heads towards Xavier's Institute.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #85. Marvel Comics.</ref> He later rescues [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Pyro]], and shocks his former teammates by revealing that he is still alive. After being proved to be the real Beast by Psylocke and Wolverine, he is allowed to join [[Bishop (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Bishop]]'s new X-Men and continues his relationship with Storm. After Bishop's death, Xavier is revealed to be alive and Beast returns to his life at the Xavier Institute.

In Issue #1 of ''[[Ultimatum (comics)|Ultimatum]]'', Beast, among [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Dazzler]], [[Warren Worthington III#Ultimate Marvel|Angel]] and [[Nightcrawler (character)#Ultimate Marvel|Nightcrawler]] are overwhelmed in [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Magneto]]'s flooding of New York (via [[Thor (Ultimate Marvel character)|Thor's]] [[Mjolnir|hammer]]). Angel survives the flood and recovers the bodies of Dazzler and Beast, who drowned. Scott cannot believe that "that size 16-wearing dweeb" would borrow his best tie and then die with it on.<ref>''Ultimatum'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Hank has a genius level IQ. His mutation grants him a simian physiology with superhuman strength, speed, stamina, reflexes, agility, flexibility, coordination, balance, and manual and pedal [[fine motor skill|dexterity]] so great he can write with all his hands and feet at once and tie knots equally well with both his fingers and toes. The [[Weapon X#Ultimate Weapon X|Weapon X]] program mutates Hank further, causing him to evolve into a more animalistic form with claws, fangs, pointed ears, enhanced senses, and thick, blue fur covering his entire body. Since then, he is like this continuously throughout the comics until his own modifications are made.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===What If?===
An issue of ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' asked "What If Beast Had Truly Become a Beast." As Hank McCoy has isolated a catalyst for a mutation in a hormone extract, industrial spies attacked and he drank the extract. He then turned into a beast when the catalyst was too well concentrated. As he escaped into the night looking for meat, Professor X telepathically contacted Beast to ask if he was OK. Beast savagely responded that he was no longer an X-Man and refused to accept his help. Professor X sent the X-Men to retrieve him before any harm can come to people. Beast managed to take Angel down before being scared away by Jean's telepathic scream. When Jean Grey and Cyclops caught up with him, Beast attacked, throwing rocks at them. With his optic beam, Cyclops destroyed most of the stones but one is able to knock out Jean Grey. When Beast was about to claim Jean as a meal, Professor X used his telepathy to calm Beast down. In his final human words, Beast told Professor X not to let him become an animal. To keep humans safe from him, the X-Men released Beast into the Savage Land where he became [[Ka-Zar (Kevin Plunder)|Ka-Zar]] and [[Zabu]]'s hunting companion.<ref>''What If?'' #37. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Beast appears in the ''What If?'' story "What If the X-Men Died on their First Mission?" as the leader of a newly formed X-Men team following his former teammates' demise on [[Krakoa]], consisting of [[Siryn|Theresa Cassidy]] (who named herself Banshee in honor of her [[Banshee (comics)|late father]]), [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Rahne Sinclair]], [[Namorita]], and [[Warpath (comics)|James Proudstar]], the brother of the original [[Thunderbird (John Proudstar)|Thunderbird]].<ref>''What If'' vol. 2 #9 (1990). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===X-Men Fairy Tales===
Beast appears as the monkey, {{lang|ja|Aoi}} ([[Japanese language|Japanese]] for ''blue'').<ref>''X-Men Fairy Tales'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Aoi appears younger and more monkey-like than the 616 version of Beast, although he retains his blue fur. Unlike the studious and intellectual Beast, Aoi is playful and mischievous. After being outwitted, Aoi joins Hitome ([[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]]). He also shows an ability to change into a larger stronger form.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===X-Men: Forever===
In this alternative reality (with a history identical to 616) that begins after Chris Claremont's ''X-Men'' 1–3, Beast retains his blue-furred ape-like appearance, and is the X-Men's chief-scientist. Beast is responsible for checking for blood-work of two Storms (one who is an evil adult and the other who is a teenager) and discovers that they are identical. After the death of Logan, who Jean was having an affair with behind Cyclops' back, Beast becomes Jean's closest friend and confidant, trying to help her over-come her loss, and her newly re-awakened Phoenix power. Recently, Jean has admitted to knowing about Hank's long-time crush on her, and the two begin a relationship.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe===
In the limited series [[Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe]], Wolverine encounters [[Deadpool]] who has killed Beast and turned his pelt into a cloak.{{issue|date=September 2020}}

===Old Man Logan===
In the "[[Old Man Logan]]" storyline, Beast is among the X-Men who perish at the hands of Wolverine when he is tricked by Mysterio into believing his friends are super-villains attacking the mansion.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Battle of the Atom===
In the possible future witnessed in ''[[Battle of the Atom]]'', Beast has mutated further, with one side of his head notably more feral than the other, including a horn. He has also defected to the Brotherhood, having apparently become disillusioned with the X-Men's goal while blaming himself for causing some unspecified catastrophe by bringing his past self into the present.<ref>''All-New X-Men'' #17</ref> He is apparently killed in the final confrontation between the various time-displaced X-Men teams, with the past and present Hank vowing that they will never accept that they become what they have just witnessed. However, he later appears alive during the future Brotherhood's new attack on Cyclops' base, during which the X-Men discover that the entire Brotherhood (With the exception of Raze, the son of Wolverine and Mystique) were under the control of Charles Xavier II (The apparent son of Xavier and Mystique), with Hank's future self being allowed just enough freedom to be horrified at what Xavier II was making him do as the telepath blames the X-Men for failing to live up to Charles Xavier's dream. At the conclusion of the fight, Hank and others are freed from Xavier II's control and allowed to return to their home time, with Hank still blaming himself for some past mistake but committed to making up for it by returning to the X-Men.{{issue|date=September 2020}}

===Print===
In the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] magazine, ''Marvel Vision'', for most of the series Beast was the supposed author of his self-titled "Beast Files". This series of two-page articles was perhaps the first time a character in any comic universe was depicted to be keeping detailed profiles on other heroes and villains.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} This format has been adopted since by many other books, including most notably the [[Alex Ross]] [[DC Comics]] series [[Justice (comics)|''Justice'']], which had two profiles in each issue during the mini-series' 12-issue run. The files appeared for over two years, and the column was voted the fan favorite.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} "Beast Files" was actually written by [[Benny R. Powell]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

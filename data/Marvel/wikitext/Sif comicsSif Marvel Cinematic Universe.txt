=== Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch ===
{{Main|Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)}}

==== Maximoff family ====
{{See also|Wiccan (character)|Speed (character)}}
Wanda and Pietro Maximoff were born to Iryna and Olek Maximoff in war-torn Sokovia, with Pietro stating that he is "twelve minutes older." Iryna and Olek were killed by a Stark Industries bomb, leading the twins down a dark path leading to the creation of Ultron, though they aided the Avengers when Ultron's true plan to destroy Sokovia and the world was revealed. Pietro was killed saving the life of Clint Barton, and Wanda's life continued in tragedy after her romantic partner Vision was killed by Thanos.

In grief, Wanda created a fictional reality based on the sitcoms she watched as a child, featuring a perfect life with her and Vision. In this reality, called the Hex, Wanda gave birth to twins, Billy and Tommy Maximoff (portrayed by Baylen Bielitz and Gavin Borders as young children respectively, and Julian Hilliard and Jett Klyne as slightly older children). Soon, it is discovered that Billy has magical powers similar to his mother, and Tommy has superhuman speed like his uncle Pietro. Ultimately, Wanda comes to terms with reality and takes down the Hex, saying goodbye to her children. However, she is corrupted by the Darkhold and uses it to try and find a universe where her children actually exist.

One such universe was designated as Earth-838, where Billy and Tommy (once again portrayed by Julian Hilliard and Jett Klyne) live happily with Wanda as a single mother, though they are terrified of Earth-616's Wanda when she reveals herself as the Scarlet Witch. While the Wanda of Earth-838 maintains her powers, Billy and Tommy don't seem to have supernatural abilities.

=== Hank Pym / Ant-Man ===
{{See also|Hank Pym}}
Dr. '''Henry "Hank" Pym''' (portrayed by [[Michael Douglas]]) is an [[Entomology|entomologist]] and [[Quantum mechanics|quantum physicist]] who created the Pym particle, a [[subatomic particle]] that changes the distance between atoms, allowing one to shrink and grow in relative size, while increasing strength. Hank Pym is the MCU's original '''Ant-Man''', a role begun in 1963, during his tenure as a high-ranking scientist and operative at S.H.I.E.L.D.

As the Ant-Man, Hank Pym operated as a classified agent performing field missions on behalf of S.H.I.E.L.D., using a self-designed shrinking suit powered by Pym particles that also gave him the ability to communicate with different species of ants. During one of these missions, his wife [[#Janet van Dyne / Wasp|Janet van Dyne]] was lost within the [[Quantum Realm]] and presumed dead. Following the incident, Pym resigns from S.H.I.E.L.D. in 1989, after he suspects Howard Stark of attempting to replicate the Pym particle formula. Pym retires the Ant-Man suit and founds his own technology company in [[San Francisco]]. In 2015, after [[Darren Cross (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Darren Cross]]' takeover of the company, Pym subsequently recruits Scott Lang to take on the mantle of Ant-Man, with the assistance of his estranged daughter [[Hope van Dyne]]. Together, they prevent Cross from selling the Yellowjacket technology to Hydra.

Following Lang's alliance with the Avengers in 2016, Pym inadvertently violates the [[Sokovia Accords]] because of Lang's misuse of his technology, and becomes a fugitive along with Hope from the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. In 2018, with help from Lang and Hope, he subsequently succeeds in rescuing Janet from the Quantum Realm. However, shortly after, Pym, along with Janet and Hope, becomes a victim of the Blip. In 2023, Pym's findings on the Quantum Realm prove fundamental to the Avengers' plan to successfully navigate through time, during which Steve Rogers steals Pym particles from a younger Pym in an alternate 1970 timeline. Pym is later restored to life and attends Tony Stark's funeral with Janet, Hope, and Lang.

In an [[What If... the World Lost Its Mightiest Heroes?|alternate universe]], Pym dresses in the Yellowjacket armor and murders prospective Avengers Tony Stark, Thor, Clint Barton, Bruce Banner, and Natasha Romanoff as revenge on Nick Fury for Hope's death. He is eventually arrested and taken to Asgard by Loki for killing Thor. In [[What If... Zombies?!|another alternate universe]], Pym ventures into the Quantum Realm and is infected by Janet with a zombie virus that is subsequently spread across Earth when they return.

{{As of|2022}}, the character has appeared in three films: ''Ant-Man'', ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'', and ''Avengers: Endgame''.

The '''Lizard''' ('''Dr. Curtis''' "'''Curt'''" '''Connors''') is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]], he first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #6 (November [[1963 in comics|1963]]) as an enemy of the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]]. While the character has retained this role throughout most of his subsequent appearances, he has also been portrayed as a tragic [[antihero]] and occasional ally of Spider-Man. Connors is sometimes an ally of Spider-Man just as himself, and not necessarily as his alter ego.

In the original version of the story, Curt Connors was a [[geneticist]] researching the ability of certain reptiles to [[Regeneration (biology)|regrow]] missing limbs. He developed a lizard DNA-based serum that would allow humans to do the same, and tested it on himself, hoping to regain his missing right arm; instead, he transformed into a feral anthropomorphic lizard. Although Spider-Man was able to undo the transformation, the Lizard remained a part of Connors'  subconscious, and would resurface time and time again; often retaining Connors' intelligence and attempting to replace mankind with a race of reptilian creatures like himself. Many stories featuring the Lizard deal with the effects he has on Connors' life and psyche, as the latter lives in constant fear that the Lizard will one day completely and irreversibly take over his body. Because of this, he works tirelessly to find a permanent cure for his alternate personality, much to the worry of his wife, [[Martha Connors]], and son, [[Billy Connors (comics)|Billy]].

The character has appeared in numerous ''Spider-Man'' adaptations, including films, animated series, and video games. In live-action, he was played by [[Dylan Baker]] in the films ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' (2004) and ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' (2007), and by [[Rhys Ifans]] in the film ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' (2012) as well as the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]'' (2021). In 2009, the Lizard was ranked [[IGN]]'s 62nd Greatest Comic Villain of All Time.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/62.html Lizard is number 62] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029194500/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/62.html |date=October 29, 2013 }} [[IGN]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
Curtis "Curt" Connors was born in [[Coral Gables, Florida]]. He was a gifted [[surgeon]] who enlisted in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]. He performed emergency battlefield surgery on wounded GIs. However his right arm was terribly injured in a wartime blast, resulting in its amputation.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #6">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref name="Web of Spider-Man vol. 2, #6">''Web of Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After his return to civilian life as a research technologist, Connors became obsessed with uncovering the secrets of reptilian limb regeneration. Working from his home in the [[Florida]] [[Everglades]] with the help of war buddy [[Man-Thing|Ted Sallis]], he finally developed an experimental serum taken from [[Reptile|reptilian]] [[DNA]].<ref name="Web of Spider-Man vol. 2, #6" /> The serum successfully regrew the missing limb of a rabbit, so then Connors chose to test the serum on himself. He ingested the formula and he did indeed grow a new arm.

However, the formula had an unfortunate [[side effect]]: Connors was subsequently transformed into a [[reptilian humanoid]] monster.<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |pages=191–192}}</ref> Spider-Man discovered this situation during a trip to Florida to investigate newspaper reports of the Lizard after his employer the ''Daily Bugle'' challenged him. After discovering the Lizard's true identity and origin, Spider-Man used Connors' notes to create an antidote to restore him to his human form and mentality.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #6" /> Another attempt to develop this serum for safe use again resulted in Connors transforming into the Lizard, but on this occasion he was saved thanks to his former colleague [[Professor X]] and his first team of [[X-Men]], the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] and the [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] tracking the Lizard down in the swamps so that the [[Iceman (Marvel Comics)|Iceman]] could send him into hibernation long enough to develop a cure.<ref>''X-Men: First Class'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Life in New York===
Later, Curt Connors relocated to [[New York City]]. He was able to repay Spider-Man by developing a formula to save May Parker's life after Peter Parker had given his aunt his radioactive blood during a transfusion, unintentionally putting her in mortal peril.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #32–33. Marvel Comics.</ref> It later became clear that the success of Connors' apparent cure from the Lizard persona was short-lived. A repeating pattern soon occurred, with stress or a chemical reaction turning Connors into the Lizard, Spider-Man fighting him, and then forcing him to swallow the antidote in order to reverse the transformation until the next time. A second personality had formed with the Lizard, one with the familiar goal shared by many villains of taking over the world. The Lizard envisioned a world where all humans had been transformed into (or replaced by) super-reptiles like himself. Despite the Lizard's overall hatred of humans, he was often shown to be unwilling to harm his wife [[Martha Connors|Martha]] or young son [[Billy Connors (comics)|Billy]].

As Connors, he aided Spider-Man in defeating the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] by developing a formula to dissolve the Rhino's bulletproof hide, but accidentally transformed himself into the Lizard due to exposure to the chemicals needed to create the formula and was restored by Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #42–45. Marvel Comics.</ref> Connors was later abducted and forced to create a rejuvenation serum for [[Silvermane]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #73–75. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, the stress from this caused Connors to again transform; the Lizard then battled Spider-Man and the [[Human Torch]], and was restored to normal once again by Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #75–77. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During another encounter with Spider-Man after Peter's attempts to remove his powers resulted in him [[The Six Arms Saga|growing four extra arms]], a bite from [[Morbius the Living Vampire|Morbius]] endowed the Lizard with Connors' personality via the infection of a strange enzyme. Connors then synthesized an antidote for himself and Spider-Man using the Morbius enzyme.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #100-102. Marvel Comics.</ref> Curt Connors later aided Spider-Man, [[Ka-Zar (Kevin Plunder)|Ka-Zar]], and the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] against [[Stegron|Stegron the Dinosaur Man]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #19–20. Marvel Comics.</ref> After the apparent death of the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]], Dr. Connors determined that Spider-Man was not a clone.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #150</ref> Later, the Lizard battled both Stegron and Spider-Man after Stegron kidnapped Billy Connors.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #165–166. Marvel Comics.</ref> For a time, Peter Parker worked as a teaching assistant to Dr. Connors at Empire State University, although Connors had no idea that Peter was actually Spider-Man. During this time, Spider-Man and Connors dealt with one of Connors' previous experiments in the form of the [[Iguana (comics)|Iguana]].<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #32–34. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref name="mnyc">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 32 | isbn = 978-1-4165-3141-8}}</ref>

During the first of the [[Secret Wars]], the Lizard refused to participate on either side of the conflict.{{issue|date=September 2021}} Although he was collected by the [[Beyonder]] along with other villains, he broke away from the main group after the first battle to settle in a swamp, where he befriended the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], who had helped him treat an injury that he had sustained in the first battle.{{issue|date=September 2021}} After the Lizard was blasted by the magic of the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]], he reverted to human form.<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes Secret Wars'' #12</ref>

After Connors' return from this event, his wife Martha, unable to take it anymore since Connors had said that he had been permanently cured, only to disappear for many days and then return home in tattered clothing with no plausible explanation as to where he had been, took their son Billy and separated from Curt. The Lizard had apparently been affected by inter-dimensional teleportation so that Connors' mind presided over the Lizard, and he battled the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]] alongside Spider-Man.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #127. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, mystical activity during the [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|''Inferno'' crisis]] once again brought the Lizard's bestial nature to the fore, and Spider-Man cured him again.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #313. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===The 1990s through 2007: ''Civil War''===
Connors then tried to straighten out his life and control the Lizard, with some degree of success. This ended when the villainess [[Calypso (comics)|Calypso]] used her voodoo magic to take control of the Lizard (during the [[Torment (comics)|''Torment'' storyline]]) for her own purposes, reducing him to a mindless, savage state. After a series of bloody battles, the Lizard and Calypso were defeated by Spider-Man, and Spider-Man assumed that he perished under Calypso's spell.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #1–5. Marvel Comics.</ref> Connors once again gained control of the Lizard's mind and body, although it was very weak. Curt carried out a plan to cure himself temporarily,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #365. Marvel Comics.</ref> after which he voluntarily submitted to incarceration in the supervillain prison the [[Vault (Marvel Comics)|Vault]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #27. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Calypso forced the transformation and attempted to control the Lizard once again, the creature killed her and escaped from the Vault. After this escape, the Lizard fell and sank into a [[quicksand]] pit during a battle in the Everglades with Spider-Man and the bounty hunter Warrant and was believed to have died.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #109–111. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, a huge bestial Lizard appeared,<ref>''Spider-Man Super Special'' #1 (1995). Marvel Comics.</ref> shortly after Connors was called in to investigate Peter Parker's sudden sickness (the result of Peter's recently lost spider-powers returning). Spider-Man ([[Ben Reilly]]) realized that not only had the Lizard survived, but revealed later his new monstrous transformation seemed to be permanent and the personality of Curt Connors appeared completely lost. However, when this savage mindless Lizard later unexpectedly encountered Dr. Connors himself while Connors was helping Peter, Curt became the true Lizard once again and saved his family by killing the "Lizard-clone". It was revealed that the Lizard-clone was a scientific accident resulting from an experimental formula being tested on a piece of the original Lizard's tail, which had then grown into a fully formed second creature.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #237–239. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Although reunited after Curt's apparent death, Martha and Billy were diagnosed with cancer after being exposed to carcinogens from living near an industrial lab in Florida. Spider-Man assisted Curt in successfully forcing Monnano, the lab's owner, to admit culpability, but Martha died from her cancer.<ref>''Spider-Man: Quality of Life'' #1–4. Marvel Comics.</ref> Billy recovered but remained bitter towards his father. Curt's guilt and internalized anger led him to become the Lizard once again, and once human, Curt attempted a bank robbery so that he would be sent to prison.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #11–13. Marvel Comics.</ref> After a short-lived term, Connors was released and changed into the Lizard once more, this time due to a scheme by [[Norman Osborn]] to form the [[Sinister Six#Sinister Twelve|Sinister Twelve]] to kill Spider-Man. The Sinister Twelve were defeated and captured by the combined forces of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], the [[Fantastic Four]], and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #7–11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Lizard resurfaced to face Spider-Man with the aid of Billy Connors, who was changed into an adolescent Lizard by his father.<ref>''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #23–27. Marvel Comics.</ref> Both the Lizard and his son were captured and reverted. Billy's transformational ability has been ignored since. A new [[Sinister Six]] team, including new member the Lizard, appeared during the superhero ''[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]'', but it was stopped by [[Captain America]] and his [[Secret Avengers]].<ref>''Civil War'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Post-''Civil War'', Curt Connors aided Spider-Man in developing a cure for the victims of [[Mister Hyde (Marvel Comics)|Mister Hyde]] who were mutated with unstable versions of Spider-Man's powers.<ref>''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #35–37. Marvel Comics.</ref> Dr. Connors has also monitored the progress of the hero [[Komodo (comics)|Komodo]], a female grad student who stole a sample of Connors' Lizard formula. She modified the formula for her own DNA to grow back her missing legs and to give herself reptilian powers.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Brand New Day'' (2008) and beyond===
Doctor Curt Connors appeared in the 2008 ''[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]'' storyline, where he experimented with animal [[stem cells]] as well as aiding forensic specialist [[Carlie Cooper]]. The third [[Freak (Spider-Man villain)|Freak]] mistook Connors' stem cells experiment for drugs. Connors helped Spider-Man defeat the Freak during their second encounter.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #553–558. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the events of ''[[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt|The Gauntlet]]'', Curt Connors was working for the pharmaceutical company Phelcorp under executive Brian King. Connors had lost custody of his son, Billy, and started hearing the voice of the Lizard persona goading him to let it have control. After Connors' assistant slept with King, Connors began struggling to contain the Lizard, ultimately losing control when King stopped him from taking a dose of his Lizard suppressing antidote. When Connors changed into the Lizard, he devoured King as a rival male.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #630. Marvel Comics.</ref> Knowing that the Lizard has targeted Connors' son Billy in the past, Peter Parker decides to protect Billy and swings to his foster parents' home. There, he finds that Billy was kidnapped and his new parents are being held hostage by [[Kraven the Hunter (Ana Kravinoff)|Ana Kravinoff]]. Ana had left Billy in an alley, where the Lizard ate him, the trauma of which functionally destroyed the Connors persona.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #631. Marvel Comics.</ref> Without Connors internally warring with the Lizard, he enters a metamorphasis, emerging in a new form, sporting a leaner physique, long brown spikes on its head, spikes on its right forearm, human intelligence, and the ability to telepathically communicate with the underdeveloped "lizard hindbrain" portion of human brains. He demonstrated the latter ability by triggering the instinctual prey response of Spider-man's lizard brain, temporarily overwhelming the superhero and causing him to flee in terror. Back on the street, the Lizard mentally triggered the lizard portion of numerous people's brains, causing them to behave in savage and often violent ways.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #632. Marvel Comics.</ref> Away from the Lizard, Spider-Man ingested Connors' Lizard suppressant formula, temporarily making him immune to the Lizard's mind controlling powers. Spider-Man then injected the Lizard with some of the formula, hoping that Connors would be able to resume control. Although Connors is no longer present, the formula does increase the prominence of the Lizard's "monkey brain", aka the human intelligence portion of its brain. This causes him to consider (and regret) some of his actions, including killing Billy and trying to make people embrace their lizard instincts. Reverting most of the people he had affected with his telepathic powers, The Lizard disappeared into the sewers after the fight.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #633. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the ''Origin of the Species'', the Lizard joined [[Doctor Octopus]]'s supervillain team<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #642. Marvel Comics.</ref> and stole [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Menace]]'s baby.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #645. Marvel Comics.</ref> As Doctor Octopus and Spider-Man fought within the Lizard's hideout, the Lizard at first attacked Spider-Man, but then gladly returned the baby. He revealed that he already took a blood sample from the baby and found out that Norman Osborn was not the father; therefore, the baby was useless to him and all of the villains. Doctor Octopus, angry about the Lizard's hypnotism obstructing his intellect, attacked him while Spider-Man escaped with the baby. Both Doctor Octopus and the Lizard survived this fight.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #646. Marvel Comics.</ref>

A short time later, while investigating kidnappings in New York, the [[X-Men]] found themselves working with Spider-Man after they discovered that the abductor is the Lizard, who had been turning the victims into lizard people, while maintaining his control over the city's reptile population.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 3 #8. Marvel Comics.</ref> The X-Men and Spider-Man discovered that the Lizard was being used by the [[Dark Beast]], who had given the Lizard his 'reptilian shift' abilities by using a machine.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 3 #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the battle, the Lizard shifted [[Gambit (Marvel Comics)|Gambit]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] into lizard people. [[Emma Frost]] and Spider-Man escaped the machine's effects, released the Lizard and used him to defeat the Dark Beast, who was arrested while the Lizard escaped.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 3 #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Sometime later, Dr. [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Michael Morbius]] discovered that the Lizard<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #679. Marvel Comics.</ref> had used DNA samples from Billy Connors' corpse to restore Curt Connors to humanity. Unfortunately, the Lizard's psyche was still present<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #688. Marvel Comics.</ref> and was pretending to be Connors so that he would be left alone. The Lizard/Connors released blood into the air supply to provoke Morbius into attacking the other lab workers. The Lizard/Connors then tried to recreate his original Lizard formula so that he could change again, but Morbius' cure instead only allowed him to regrow his missing arm. The Lizard/Connors then injected [[Max Modell]] and other Horizon Lab personnel with his formula to discover how to "cure" himself.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #689. Marvel Comics.</ref> Attempting to appear to be the "normal" Connors, the Lizard/Connors cut off his regrown limb, but the Lizard began to appreciate human life, to the point that when he found the correct Lizard serum, he contemplated remaining human,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #690. Marvel Comics.</ref> but he took the cure when Spider-Man arrived and threatened him with custody. This resulted in yet another streamlined, new form. A new cure was developed for the lab employees that he had changed, but this formula failed on the Lizard's new form; he was instead knocked out and taken to the Raft. Visiting him in the Raft, Spider-Man was unaware that the serum had restored Connors' psyche and Connors remained in prison willingly, as he felt that he deserved it for his actions as the Lizard.<ref name="asm691">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #691. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Dying Wish (comics)|Dying Wish]]" storyline, Peter Parker (whose mind was trapped within Doctor Octopus' dying body) was freed from the Raft by the Trapster, Hydro-Man, and the Scorpion. The Trapster offered to free the Lizard, but Connors declined.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #699">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #699. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Morbius the Living Vampire managed to escape his cell, the Lizard pointed out that he still had nowhere to go. For unknown reasons, Morbius then freed the Lizard.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #699" />

The Lizard was then seen back in his cell, being one of the few inmates left to be transported out of the decommissioned Raft.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> When [[Alistair Smythe]] attempted an escape from the Raft, he temporarily shut down the Raft's power, letting the Lizard out of his cell.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Lizard protected [[J. Jonah Jameson]] from the Scorpion, revealing that he had the mind of Curt Connors, and that he "will never let the monsters win again." Jameson defended the Lizard from the Raft's warden, calling him a hero, and protesting the use of a restraining device, though the Lizard himself preferred to be cautious. During Smythe's final escape attempt, the Lizard was impaled through the shoulder, but survived.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As part of the "[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]" as part of the lead-up to the "[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]" storyline, the Lizard was shown at the Andry Corrections Facility. He was escorted to the visitor's room and his restraints were removed. After the guards left the visitor's room, the Lizard met the mysterious [[Ben Reilly|red-suited man]] where he claimed to have met Curt Connors before. The Lizard detected familiar scents accompanying the man, scents that could not be there, and warned him not to toy with the Lizard. The red-suited man replied that he was not the Lizard; inside he was Curt Connors, a model prisoner who saved Mayor J. Jonah Jameson and various civilians before and was trapped in a monster's body. The Lizard lashed out at him, demanding to know how can the people that he was smelling be there. The man said that the Lizard had abilities that he could use and if he escaped and joined him, he could give him anything. He snapped his fingers and Martha Connors and Billy Connors stepped forward, where they were somehow alive. The red-suited man asked if they have a deal. The Lizard tearfully accepted his deal.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> It was revealed that the revived Martha Connors and Billy Connors were clones that the red-suited man had gathered to grow clones with false memories that span all the way to their deaths.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Lizard and a depowered Electro were later sprung from Andry Corrections Facility by the Rhino on the red-suited man's behalf.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #10. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Lizard worked with the Jackal on a procedure that would repower Electro. The first time it was interrupted, the Lizard was present when the Jackal summoned a somehow-revived Francine appears in order to convince Maxwell to go through with it. The second time it was interrupted was when Martha Connors informed everyone present about a fire in Edmond, Oklahoma that neither of them was responsible for.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #16. Marvel Comics.</ref> While escaping from New U Technologies, Spider-Man and Spider-Woman of Earth-65 quickly incapacitate the Lizard.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #3</ref> When Doctor Octopus pulled a switch which activated the Carrion Virus in all of the clones and caused them to start rapidly decaying, the Lizard saw that Martha Connors and Billy Connors were affected.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the ensuing battle, the Lizard escaped with Martha and Billy as he vowed to find a way to keep them from dying.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #5</ref> In the sewers of San Francisco, the Lizard saved Martha and Billy Connors from the Carrion Virus by injecting them with the Lizard formula, turning his wife and son into lizard people like himself.<ref>''Clone Conspiracy Omega'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Connors was later shown having returned to Empire State University,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> now using a special chip implanted in the back of his neck to control his Lizard persona, with the chip acting as an inhibitor that stopped him from attacking humans. Teaching once again, Connors offered to support Peter Parker's efforts to re-apply for his doctorate after he was academically disgraced by accusations of plagiarism of Otto Octavius' thesis since Doctor Octopus' mind was in Peter's body at the time. The inhibitor proved to be a disadvantage when Connors' class was attacked by the [[Taskmaster (character)|Taskmaster]] and the [[Eric O'Grady|Black Ant]] and he could not defend himself.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Connors was captured by Kraven the Hunter as part of his [[Hunted (comics)|organized hunt for various animal-themed villains]], he was locked in a cell with Spider-Man while the two of them watched live footage of the Black Cat and the Lizard-esque Billy Connors being hunted, with Billy admitting that he actually remembers his original death. Faced with a threat to his son, Connors asked Spider-Man to tear out the inhibitor chip so that he could rescue his son, despite the risk of this action leaving Connors paralyzed at best, the two unaware that Kraven had set the situation up precisely to force Spider-Man into a position where he would become the ruthless warrior that Kraven believes that he 'should' be.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #21</ref> However, Connors managed to maintain control and retrieve Billy without killing anyone.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #22. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In a prelude to the "[[Sinister War]]" storyline, Doctor Octopus coerced Curt Connors into using the Isotope Genome Accelerator on himself which separates him from his Lizard side. Kindred then completed the Sinister Six by having Mysterio join him as Kindred notes that his endgame with Spider-Man is approaching. Spider-Man found Connors in his wrecked lab as he was informed on what happened. Peter then took Connors home in the sewer to recover with his family. Spider-Man suspects that Doctor Octopus is forming his latest incarnation of the Sinister Six.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #70. Marvel Comics.</ref> Lizard's Isotope Genome Accelerator duplicate and the rest of the Sinister Six proceeded to compete with the other villains that Kindred enlisted to take out Spider-Man. Doctor Octopus managed to have all the villains subdued when he hacked into [[Eric O'Grady|Black Ant]]'s helmet by changing the setting to centipedes which affected the centipedes in every villains' head.<ref>''Sinister War'' #1-4.</ref>

During the "[[Beyond (2021 comics)|Beyond]]" storyline, Maxine Danger of the [[Beyond Corporation]] sent [[Misty Knight]] and [[Colleen Wing]] into the sewers where they apprehended Lizards' Isotope Genome Accelerator duplicate.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #82. Marvel Comics.</ref> Upon being taken to Beyond Corporation's secret facility on Staten Island, the genetic template of Lizard's Isotope Genome Accelerator duplicate were used with the genetic template of Morbius the Living Vampire to create a binary clone called Creature Z which looks like a white version of Lizard with the fangs and wings of a vampire bat. After the facility was destroyed by [[Monica Rambeau]] and the [[Machine Man]] Imposter and Creature Z was overloaded with the blood it sucked out, Lizard's Isotope Genome Accelerator duplicate was rescued by Morbius. As Morbius planned to work with him in curing their conditions, he is unaware that the Lizard he rescued is an Istopte Genome accelerator duplicate.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #91-92.BEY.

==Powers and abilities==
Dr. Curtis Connors gave himself superhuman powers as a result of exposure to the Lizard Formula, allowing him to transform into the Lizard. In human form, he has none of his superhuman powers, but he is highly intelligent and a well known scientist in fields of [[genetics]], [[physics]], [[biochemistry]] and [[herpetology]].

When Connors is transformed into the Lizard, his strength is increased to superhuman levels. Likewise, his speed, stamina, agility, and reflexes are also raised to a level equivalent to that of Spider-Man. He can also scale walls using a combination of his sharp claws and micro-scales on his hands and feet that create molecular friction like those of a gecko. He is highly resistant to injury due to his thick scaly hide, allowing him to resist punctures and lacerations from ordinary weapons and lower-caliber firearms. In addition, the Lizard has highly enhanced healing abilities which allow him to quickly recover from grievous wounds, including regenerating lost limbs. He also has a powerful tail which he can whip at high speeds. The Lizard has razor-sharp teeth set in muscular jaws that can deal a lethal bite (the latter is established in the Lizard's later appearances; in his earlier appearances he seems to have no teeth at all). Like a reptile, he has [[Ectotherm|cold-blooded]] characteristics and is therefore sensitive to drops in temperature; a sufficiently cold environment will cause his metabolism to slow drastically and become dormant if he is exposed to cold temperatures for too long.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #45">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #45. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Lizard can mentally communicate and command all reptiles within a mile of himself via limited [[telepathy]]. He has also on at least one occasion secreted powerful [[pheromone]]s which caused nearby humans to behave violently. Post-''Brand New Day'', a further enhancement of his telepathy granted him the power of telepathically compelling humans to act out their primal urges, by suppressing emotional control in their [[amygdala]] (the "lizard brain").{{Issue|date=May 2010}}

Based on various physiological and environmental factors, the Lizard's intelligence can range from bestial and animalistic to normal human intelligence. The Lizard personality has most often manifested with human intelligence, capable of speech and higher reasoning, although some versions have been more feral than others. During the "[[Secret Wars]]" in particular, he appeared less ruthless than his normal portrayal, showing concern for [[Volcana (Marvel Comics)|Volcana]]<ref>''Secret Wars'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref> and the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]<ref>''Secret Wars'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> after they showed him kindness despite his usual disdain for humans. However, even when operating at the level of a human, the Lizard is rarely as intelligent as Dr. Connors, showing on many occasions an inability to understand his human self's work and use it to further his own ends despite his best efforts.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #45" />

The Lizard has apparently "destroyed" the Curt Connors persona, but has subsequently begun to display some of Connors's human emotions.{{Issue|date=June 2010}} In contrast to his previously feral nature, he has also shown sufficient intellectual capabilities to replicate Connors' work for himself, although he is still hampered by his inability to fully comprehend human emotions.{{issue|date=July 2012}}

== Continuity ==
In a 2004 story arc entitled ''Lizard's Tale'', written by [[Paul Jenkins (writer)|Paul Jenkins]] in the ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' comic book, it was revealed that the Lizard persona was not a separate personality from Dr. Connors after all&nbsp;— Curt had been consciously controlling his reptilian alter ego all along. Furthermore, Connors was shown to know that Peter Parker was Spider-Man, despite the discovery of the secret identity never being explained or depicted. The story ended with Dr. Connors deliberately getting himself sent to prison and hoping the Lizard would not be unleashed again. The Lizard's next appearance after this was as a member of the [[Sinister Six#Sinister Twelve|Sinister Twelve]], where he showed no indication of being controlled by the mind of Dr. Connors. Although the idea of Connors controlling the Lizard was subsequently ignored, when the Lizard's mind was briefly trapped in Connors' human form, he attempted to mutate the staff of Horizon Labs into lizard people like himself, with none of the other lizards demonstrating the same hostility to humans as the Lizard, prompting Spider-Man to speculate that the Lizard's anti-human traits came from Connors' anger at the world for his lost arm and family rather than the Lizard being completely separate from Connors.<ref name="asm691" />

Another [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]]-related issue involves Connors' son Billy. Unlike many other Marvel Comics children, he has not appreciably grown up since the comics' stories of the 1960s. Billy's visible age also seems to waver back and forth between approximately eight and 13 years old, depending on the particular comic artist drawing the character.

== Other versions ==

=== ''Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows'' ===
In this [[Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows|reality]], Billy used the Lizard serum on himself and is mutated like his father (though he is not as in control of himself as Curt). Curt and Billy try breaking into high tech facilities in an attempt to find Regent's tech to turn Billy back to normal, but are thwarted by Spider-Man and his daughter Spiderling. After defeating the reptilian father and son at Oscorp, Spider-Man contacts the Fantastic Four for help in curing Billy's condition.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows'' vol. 2 #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
The one comic storyline to date featuring the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe version of Lizard appeared in ''[[Ultimate Marvel Team-Up]]'' #10. The character has appeared in a few subsequent issues of ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', but only in flashbacks and dream sequences. Lizard appears to be based on a [[Common basilisk|basilisk]] lizard in design and has been presented as being less intelligent than the original Marvel iteration.<ref name="Ultimate Spider-Man #16">''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #16</ref> Dr. Curt Conners is a noted geneticist who lost his right arm under unrevealed circumstances. He dedicated himself to finding a means of restoring lost limbs by studying the regenerative capabilities of reptiles. However, after five years without major breakthroughs, his sponsors were on the verge of cutting his funding. Drowning his disappointment with alcohol, a drunken Conners injected himself with an experimental serum in a desperate attempt to achieve results. The serum regenerated his right arm, but also transformed Conners into an inhuman reptilian creature. Seeking refuge in the sewers, he became an urban legend dubbed "the Lizard" by the press. [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Man]] sympathetically sought out Lizard who attacked the young hero until [[Man-Thing]] happened upon the scene and restored Conners to human form. Conners' restored right arm soon withered and died. However, his DNA remained irreparably damaged with dormant potential for further transformation. Conners cut himself off from his wife and son out of fear for their safety.<ref>''Ultimate Marvel Team-Up'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Dr. Conners also unintentionally created the Ultimate version of [[Carnage (character)|Carnage]] using [[DNA]] from Spider-Man and based on an analysis of his old friend [[Richard and Mary Parker#Ultimate Marvel|Richard Parker]]'s work on the [[Alternative versions of Venom|Venom]] symbiote.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #60–64. Marvel Comics.</ref> Due to the ensuing chaos, he was arrested and [[Stark Industries]] canceled their financial support of his experiments, but his assistant [[Ben Reilly]] still had one sample of Spider-Man's DNA, setting the stage for the [[Clone Saga]].<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #61. Marvel Comics.</ref> He was last seen in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #127, where Dr. Conners was pardoned and recruited by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.#Ultimate Marvel|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] where he and [[Iron Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Tony Stark]] are at when the Triskellion was blown apart by [[Alternative versions of Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] during an escape.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #127. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Early details of the character's history match his 616 counterpart, with him studying reptiles to fix his arm (the cause of this has yet to be revealed), and the condition of him leaving his wife and son (Doris and Timmy<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #1–2''. Marvel Comics.</ref>) out of fear, thereby turning to alcoholism.<ref name="Ultimate Spider-Man #16" />

===''Howard the Human''===
During the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, the Battleworld domain of New Quack City has a version of Curt Connors in it. This Curt Connors is a tough, anthropomorphic lizard who is a bartender at a place that Howard the Human frequently visits.<ref>''Howard the Human'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Exiles===
The reality-hopping heroic team, the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]], once found themselves on an alternate earth where Connors' experiment (in this world for a left arm rather than a right) had taken a different turn. Finding himself as the Lizard, Curt felt the need to "reproduce" by immediately injecting the Lizard formula into other people. He infected his family and they infected others, all feeling the urge to spread the transformation into lizard people. The forces of this particular world eventually managed to restrain the infected lizard people behind miles-long, man-made walls. When the Exiles visited this world, they discovered that Connors&nbsp;— having turned back into his human form a year ago&nbsp;— was intending to detonate a nuclear bomb in an abandoned submarine to wipe out the lizard people, but they were able to talk him down by arguing that the radioactive fallout would cause more damage, particularly since the lizard people were now mere herbivores (albeit partly because of the absence of other kinds of meat). Grief-stricken over what had become of his life, Connors subsequently killed himself.<ref>''Exiles'' #17. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Marvel 1602''===
In this reality, Curtis Connors is a philosopher who was infected with the [[bubonic plague]]. He created an elixir that transformed him into a reptilian creature that resembled a ''[[Velociraptor]]'', but retained his mind. He worked with Baron Victor Octavius to capture the Spider.<ref>''Spider-Man 1602''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Marvel Noir''===
In the [[Marvel Noir]] reality, Curt Connors is an assistant to Dr. Otto Octavius.<ref>''Spider-Man Noir: Eyes Without a Face'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> They operated in an abandoned hospital building on [[Ellis Island]], where they secretly used kidnapped African Americans as specimens by turning them into mindless slaves. It is unknown what happened to Connors after federal authorities raided the hospital, though he was presumably arrested along with Octavius' associates.<ref>''Spider-Man Noir: Eyes Without a Face'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Marvel Zombies''===
In ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'', the Lizard, like almost every other hero and villain, has become a zombie. This particular incarnation of the Lizard is apparently destroyed when he is blasted apart by several cosmic-powered heroes while fighting (and eating) [[Galactus#Marvel Zombies|Galactus]].<ref>''Marvel Zombies'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''MC2''===
The Connors family appear in the first story of the ''[[Mr. and Mrs. Spider-Man]]'' series, set in the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe. Mary Jane comforts a distraught Martha when Curt goes missing again, whilst Peter, now a parent to his infant daughter May ("Mayday"), is more hesitant than before to become Spider-Man. He is eventually encouraged by his wife to track down and prevent the Lizard's latest rampage.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Family'' #1 (Oct 2008). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Old Man Logan===
During the "[[Old Man Logan]]" storyline taking place on Earth-807128, Lizard is revealed to have claimed territory in Florida where he has taken the name of Lizard King.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #66. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the pages of "Dead Man Logan" that takes place on Earth-21923, it is shown that [[Blackwing (character)|Joseph Manfredi]] and his gang work for Lizard where one of his men has been transformed with the Lizard formula. After Logan slices off one man's arm and another man's leg while claiming their truck as his transportation, Manfredi arranges for them to be taken to Lizard so that he can treat them. Lizard was shown to have patched up the one who lost his leg and use the Lizard formula on the one who lost his arm.<ref>''Dead Man Logan'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Spider-Gwen===
On Earth-65 where [[Gwen Stacy]] became Spider-Woman after being bitten by the spider,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=53261|title=Lowe, Hine & Latour Take Readers to the "Edge of Spider-Verse"|date=June 6, 2014|website=Comicbookresources.com|access-date=October 23, 2018}}</ref> Peter Parker attempts to exact revenge on those who bullied him, becoming this universe's version of the Lizard. Gwen subdues him, but Peter ended up dying towards the end of the battle due to his use of the chemicals that transformed him. Spider-Woman is blamed for his death, causing an uproar for her arrest, led by J. Jonah Jameson, with Peter essentially becoming Gwen's [[Uncle Ben]], serving as inspiration of the need to use her powers to help others.<ref>''Edge of Spider-Verse'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

It is later revealed that Curt Connors was a teacher at Gwen's high school and was studying Lizard genetics,{{issue|date=October 2015}} possibly being involved in Peter's transformation into the Lizard and the recent sightings of multiple Lizard-people wreaking havoc in the city.{{issue|date=October 2015}}

===''Marvel Age''===
Lizard's history is the same in this reality. Spider-Man went to Florida to investigate the "Lizard Man" sightings. Spider-Man meets Martha Connors and learns that Lizard is her husband Dr. Curt Connors. After making an antidote, Spider-Man ensnares Lizard and uses the antidote to restore him to Curt Connors. Peter Parker later told J. Jonah Jameson that the "Lizard Man" was a hoax.<ref>''Marvel Age: Spider-Man'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Captain America and Black Widow===
A version of Lizard who wore the tentacles of Doctor Octopus, was brainwashed by Vennema Multiversal, but was freed and joined the battle against them.<ref>''Captain America and Black Widow'' #638. Marvel Comics</ref>

In the episode "Where Crawls the Lizard", he works on a serum intended to cure "swamp fever", but it transforms him into the '''Lizard Man''' instead. He plots to create an army of lizard people like himself and take over the world until Spider-Man foils his plans and restores him to his human form. In "Conner's Reptiles", Conner experiments with increasing reptiles' intelligence, but inadvertently turns a regular [[alligator]] into another humanoid lizard called '''Reptilla''' (voiced by [[Paul Soles]]). It kidnaps Conner, but Spider-Man rescues the latter and restores Reptilla.
* The Lizard appeared in the 1981 ''[[Spider-Man (1981 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' series episode "Lizards, Lizards, Everywhere", voiced by [[Corey Burton]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} This version is never identified as Curt Connors nor is he seen in his human form.
* Dr. Curt Connors / Lizard appeared in the 1990s ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' series, voiced by [[Joseph Campanella]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} This version maintains his genius-level intellect as the Lizard coupled with his alter ego's savage mindset from the comics. In the pilot episode "Night of the Lizard", Connors transforms into the eponymous character after using himself as a test subject for his experiments with lizard DNA in the hopes of regenerating his right arm. While transformed, he abducts his wife Margaret and takes her to his hideout in the sewers to help him transform New York's population into lizards like himself, only to be defeated by Spider-Man and restored to his human form. In "The Lizard King", a number of sewer lizards become mutated by Connors' chemicals and abduct him, who transforms into the Lizard and becomes their king. With [[Debra Whitman]]'s help, Margaret and [[Mary Jane Watson]] create a cure, which Spider-Man administers, restoring all the mutated lizards to their original forms. In the three-part episode "Secret Wars", the Lizard is among several supervillains that the [[Beyonder]] transports to an alien planet to engage in a war against a team of heroes led by Spider-Man, though the Lizard defects to the heroes' side after [[Iron Man]] and [[Mister Fantastic]] use a machine to allow Connors' mind to take control of the Lizard's body. Once the war is over, Connors is returned to Earth with no memory of what happened.
* Dr. Curt Connors / Lizard appears in the ''[[Spider-Man: The New Animated Series]]'' episode "Law of the Jungle", voiced by [[Rob Zombie]].{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} This version is more serious and colder than other versions, lost his right arm as a result of an accident while testing [[Oscorp|Oscorp Industries]]' Wide Area Explosive Fragmentation Round (WAFER), and is Peter Parker's science teacher at Empire State University.

The Lizard is introduced in a self-titled season two episode, in which Connors and Spider-Man retrieve several of [[Doctor Octopus]]'s animal DNA formulas for Connors to study. Fascinated by their potential in medicine, Connors injects himself with several doses of the lizard formula, which restores his right arm, but slowly mutates him into the Lizard, becoming more feral in the process. In response, Spider-Man reluctantly releases Doctor Octopus to help restore Connors to his human form. In "The Sinister Six", Doctor Octopus abducts Connors and forcibly turns him back into the Lizard before using a mind control device to have him join the [[Sinister Six|eponymous group]]. While most of the Sinister Six are defeated by Spider-Man and his fellow [[New Warriors|S.H.I.E.L.D. trainees]] and arrested, the Lizard breaks free from Doc Ock's control and escapes. In "Stan By Me", the Lizard steals equipment from Midtown High School to render his human side dormant. Despite Spider-Man and retired S.H.I.E.L.D. agent turned janitor [[Stan Lee|Stan]]'s interference, the Lizard succeeds and escapes once more. In "Return of the Sinister Six", Spider-Man discovers an antidote that Connors created before the Lizard's consciousness took over and cures Connors. Following this, Connors makes minor appearances throughout seasons three and four, with his most notable appearance being in the episode "Lizards", wherein Connors is again transformed into the Lizard by Doctor Octopus's spy, [[Ben Reilly]], and granted the ability to mutate others into anthropomorphic lizards via his bite.

Connors is portrayed as a somewhat sympathetic, yet misguided individual, who is driven by the loss of his right arm and a desire to do genuine good, while his Lizard alter-ego is much more feral, but retains Connors' intelligence and eventually takes over his body. Additionally, this version of the Lizard does not wear clothes and has a less pronounced snout, giving him a more humanoid appearance.
** Connors first appears in the Sony film ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' (2012). Richard's son [[Peter Parker (The Amazing Spider-Man film series)|Peter]] finds his father's notes and visits Connors to continue what he and Richard started. The two successfully formulate a serum together, which Connors, after being fired from Oscorp for refusing to rush into human trials, injects himself with. The serum regenerates Connors' lost arm, but eventually mutates him into the Lizard, who goes on a rampage until Spider-Man intervenes. Escaping into the sewer, Connors reverts, develops an obsession with his new abilities, builds a makeshift off-site lab, and experiments on himself further due to the chemicals affecting his mind. After the Lizard discovers Spider-Man's secret identity on his first encounter, he develops a mind of his own and asserts himself as the dominant personality, seeking to mutate all of New York into lizards like himself. However, Spider-Man foils his plan with Captain [[George Stacy]]'s help, who is killed by the Lizard in the process, and cures Connors. With the Lizard's personality gone and his sanity restored, Connors saves Peter from plummeting off of Oscorp Tower and surrenders to the authorities. In the film's [[post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], Connors is remanded to Beloit Psychiatric Hospital, where he speaks with a [[Gentleman (character)|mysterious man]] regarding the Parkers' knowledge of him, who vanishes from the room after Connors displays scales on his arm.

However, the [[Norman Osborn (Sam Raimi film series)|Green Goblin]] convinces most of the villains to fight back instead. The Lizard joins [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)#Film|Sandman]] and [[Electro (Marvel Comics)#Film|Electro]] in fighting Spider-Man and two alternate universe versions of himself, including the Lizard's version, before he is eventually defeated and cured by the second Parker.

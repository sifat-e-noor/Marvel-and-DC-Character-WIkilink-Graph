'''Laufey''' is a <!--Do not add "fictional" as it is tautological; supervillains (and characters in general) are by definition implied to be fictionalized to some extent.-->[[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is depicted usually as an enemy of the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian king]] [[Odin (comics)|Odin]], father of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. He is the King of the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Frost Giants]], the biological father of Thor's adopted brother and archenemy, [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], he first appeared in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #112 (Jan. [[1965 in comics|1965]]), and was based on the goddess [[Laufey|of the same name]] who in [[Norse mythology]] was actually the mother of Loki.

[[Colm Feore]] portrayed the character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011).

==Publication history==
Laufey was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] and first appeared in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #112 (Jan. 1965).

==Fictional character biography==
In the early days of the universe, Laufey ruled [[Jötunheimr|Jotunheim]], realm of the Frost Giants. When his son [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] was born a [[runt]], an ashamed Laufey ordered the baby hidden.<ref name="jim112" />

[[Odin (comics)|Odin]], the King of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], marched his forces into Jotunheim.<ref name="jim112">''Journey into Mystery'' #112 (Jan. 1965)</ref> Welding the mystical hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]],<ref name="thorv280">''Thor'' vol. 2 #80 (Aug. 2004)</ref> Odin faced down Laufey and destroyed his war club, prompting the Frost Giant to brandish a sword. Laufey tried to use his knowledge of land, such as trying to stop Odin with a concealed fire pit. A sprawling battle between the two forces ensued.<ref name="jim112" /> The battle ended when Odin used Mjolnir to crush Laufey's skull.<ref name="thorv280" /> Odin discovered Loki in the wreckage of the castle and decided to raise him as his own. 

It was later [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] that Loki had been a child, rather than a baby, when Laufey was killed. The day before the battle, Loki had attempted to inform his father of an opportunity to stealthily kill Odin. Laufey struck Loki for calling him a coward.<ref name="jms12">''Thor'' vol. 3 #12 (Jan. 2009)</ref> The next day, after the fateful battle and Odin's claiming of Loki as a son, Laufey was left wounded, but alive. A version of Loki from the future, who had traveled back in time to alter events, proceeded to decapitate him, stating that Laufey would never strike him again. He also made Odin adopt him.<ref name="jms12" />

Laufey's skull plays an important role in the first three issues of the renewed Thor series. Laufey's revitalized men attempt to reclaim his remains from a [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon]] facility owned by [[Minotaur (comics)|Minotaur]].<ref>''Thor'' vol. 4 #1-3 (2014). Marvel Comics.</ref> Upon traveling to Jotunheim with [[Malekith the Accursed]], Minotaur used the blood of the Light Elves that were killed as part of a spell to resurrect Laufey.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 4 #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As part of the "[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]" event, Laufey appears as a member of the Dark Council alongside Malekith the Accursed, Minotaur, [[Ulik]], and some unnamed Fire Demons.<ref>''The Mighty Thor'' vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[War of the Realms]]" storyline, Laufey appears and is about to eat [[Frigga (comics)|Frigga]] when Loki arrives and saves his adopted mother. Laufey berates Loki on his recent treachery in the past. He then picks him up and seemingly eats him.<ref>''War of the Realms'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Odin later gets enraged when he finds out that Laufey ate Loki.<ref>''War of the Realms'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Laufey is later seen at the ruins of the [[Statue of Liberty]] swatting fighter jets.<ref>''War of the Realms'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> Laufey is later attacked by the [[Fantastic Four]] and an army of [[Dwarves (Marvel Comics)|Dwarves]] that are wearing copies of the [[War Machine]] armor.<ref>''War of the Realms'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> Iron Man, Punisher, She-Hulk, Spider-Man, and Wolverine are fighting Laufey's Frost Giants. As Captain Marvel, Black Panther, Sif, and Thing confront Laufey, he pulls out the Casket of Ancient Winters which he eats as it augments his powers. While protected by Hofund's magic, Daredevil fights with Laufey until Laufey eats Hofund when it is thrown at him. Noticing that the Earth-1610 Mjolnir is going to self-destruct, Jane Foster throws it into Laufey as a half-digested Loki cuts himself and the Casket of Ancient Winters using Hofund where his magic is holding his body together.<ref>''War of the Realms'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Like all Frost Giants, Laufey is immortal and possesses superhuman strength and resistance to physical injury and Earthly illness, as well as a weakness to heat. As a Frost Giant, Laufey is unharmed by cold temperatures, making him immune to [[hypothermia]] and [[frostbite]].

Laufey is cryokinetic and has been seen wielding many weapons, including a giant [[Club (weapon)|war club]],<ref name="jim112"/> a [[sword]],<ref name="jim112"/> and a large [[axe]].<ref name="jms12"/>

==In other media==
===Television===
Laufey appears in the ''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]'' episode "Hulks on Ice", voiced by [[Enn Reitel]]. He leads the Frost Giants in a plot to take over the Nine Realms. Amidst the agents of S.M.A.S.H. and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] attempts to stop them, Laufey also locates and arranges for [[Ymir (Marvel Comics)|Ymir]] to be freed to fulfill his plans. After the [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]] defeats Ymir however, Laufey retreats.

Laufey appears in the [[What If...? (TV series)|''What If...?'']] episode "[[What If... Thor Were an Only Child?]]", where Odin returns Loki to him instead of adopting him, resulting a truce between Asgardians and Frost Giants. Loki has taken a blue gigantic appearance and is best friends with Thor, who has become a party-loving prince who throws wild global parties.

As in the comics, he is [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]]'s father, though he is unaware of this.

After a group of Frost Giants tried to get into Asgard in the present however, [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] led Loki, [[Sif (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sif]], and the [[Warriors Three]] to confront Laufey for violating the treaty. This results in a fight until Odin stops them and recalls Thor, Sif, and the Warriors Three to Asgard. Loki later gives Laufey access to Asgard to kill Odin while he is in his Odinsleep. Before Laufey can do so however, Loki betrays and kills the former.

==Raptor==
===Gary Wilton, Jr.===
During the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline, Raptor was among the many superhumans trying to flee out of USA and into France, but was confronted by the French superhero [[Peregrine (comics)|Le Peregrine]] over the [[Bay of Biscay]], during a massive incursion tentative of refugees.<ref>''Civil War: Battle Damage Report'' #1</ref>

===Brenda Drago===
Brenda Drago was forced by her father into what was supposed to be a life of crime, as he gave her a suit equipped with functional wings (created from technology used in the costume he had worn as the second Vulture). Brenda became a flying thief known as the Raptor. But her crime spree was stopped by the combined efforts of [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]] and [[Buzz (Marvel Comics)|The Buzz]]. In a surprising twist of fate, Raptor actually became friends with Spider-Girl. She even began to use her flight-suit as a hero, joining with Spider-Girl and Buzz in the formation of a new [[New Warriors]].<ref>''Spider-Girl'' #18</ref> She even fell in love with Spider-Girl's friend Normie Osborn, and the two became engaged.<ref>''Spider-Girl'' #81</ref>

However, Raptor's luck went bad when she was held accountable for her previous crimes by a man named Agent Wheadon, who made Raptor join his crime-fighting team of "reformed" criminals, in exchange for a pardon. However, Normie bonded with the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote, and made a bargain with Wheadon, offering his new powers in helping Wheadon's team in exchange for Raptor's release.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

In an attempt to remove Spider-Girl from her friends, the new [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]], (later revealed to be the original Hobgoblin, [[Roderick Kingsley]]) savagely attacked Raptor and chained her body to a fence.<ref>''Spider-Girl'' #98</ref> In the following issue, she was taken to the hospital where she seemed to be recovering. She later marries [[Normie Osborn]].<ref>''Spider-Girl'' #100</ref>

===Damon Ryder===
In his first appearance, Damon Ryder infiltrated [[Aunt May|May Parker]]'s engagement party in Boston. He had stalked her relatives, the Reilly's, for some time in an attempt to find [[Ben Reilly]], who he claimed burned down his house and killed his family. He found Peter Parker, whom Ben was cloned from, and attacked him, believing him to be Ben. Peter was able to fend off Raptor's attack long enough to sneak off and change into his Spider-Man costume. The two battled, and Raptor was eventually defeated. However, he managed to escape while Peter was distracted at the shock of learning about Ryder's interest in Ben Reilly.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Annual #36</ref>

Ryder later tracked Peter down to New York, first attacking him at the Front Line office, then going to his apartment with the intent of leaving a message for Peter with his roommate, Michelle Gonzalez. He then went to May's house, where Peter's cousins and [[Harry Osborn]] were staying, and took all the occupants hostage. When Peter arrived, Raptor threatened to kill them all unless Peter revealed his "true" identity.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Through flashbacks, it was shown that Ben Reilly once worked as lab assistant to Ryder. The two became close friends during their work searching for proof of dinosaurs being human ancestors, with Ben meeting Ryder's wife and children. However, Ben soon discovered that Ryder had experimented on himself with [[Dromaeosauridae|raptor]] genes in an attempt to further their research. When he confronted him, Ryder grew angry and the two argued. Damon attacked Ben, but Ben managed to restrain him, hoping to bring in a geneticist to purge his system of the mutation. Damon managed to escape in the interim, and Ben followed him to his home, where Damon revealed that he was starting to mutate, thus become more susceptible to Ben's assistance. As they talked, both were unaware that Ben's fellow clone, [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]], was hiding just outside the house. Kaine jumped in through a window and attacked Ben, with a fire starting during the ensuing battle. It was then shown that Damon had murdered his own family, though he did not realize it, having been driven insane by his mutation, his warped mind causing him to conclude that Ben had killed his family in 'protest' against his experiments. Furious, Ben beat him unconscious, with Kaine commenting that the events that unfolded would have drastic consequences.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

In the present, Kaine broke into the Parker house, revealing that he was working with Raptor, under the promise of being cured of his cellular degeneration. During the fight, he exposed Peter's identity as Spider-Man, and Ben's identity as a clone. He encouraged Raptor to kill Peter, since anything Ben would do, so would Peter. Refusing to accept this, Peter affirmed both his and Reilly's innocence, proclaiming that neither of them would ever kill anyone, and beat Raptor unconscious, just as Ben had. However, Kaine managed to take Raptor and escape before the police arrived. Raptor later told Kaine that he lied about curing him in order to gain an ally. Enraged, Kaine then breaks Raptor's neck, seemingly killing him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #608–610 (October–November 2009)</ref>

After kidnapping Stark, Raza and his team torture him until he agrees to rebuild the Jericho Missile for them. They slowly fail to realize that Stark and his fellow prisoner [[Ho Yinsen]] are actually building a suit of armor to escape and manage to do so, but not before scarring Raza's face. Raza and the Ten Rings later find remnants of Stark's Mk. I armor in the desert, but they were unable to rebuild the suit or understand its intricacies. He eventually contacted his benefactor, [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]], who actually wanted Raza to kill Stark; Raza was unaware of who he was hired to kidnap and wanted Stark's weapons for himself. He planned on giving Stark's designs to Stane in exchange for "a gift of iron soldiers". Stane ends up betraying Raza and has all his men killed. Although not shown, it is assumed that Raza himself was also killed.

===Comics===
Raza made his comic book debut in ''The Invincible Iron Man'' Annual #1 (Aug. 2010) from [[Matt Fraction]] and [[Carmine Di Giandomenico]]. He ends up fulfilling exactly the same role from the movie, retconning Stark's origin again and replacing his initial inspiration, [[Wong-Chu]]. Instead of Stane however, Raza works directly for the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] who is only implied to be his leader in the films.

==Red King==
'''Red King''' ('''Angmo-Asan II''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He was created by [[Greg Pak]] and [[Carlo Pagulayan]] for their [[Planet Hulk]] arc.

Before becoming the Father Emperor of [[Sakaar]], Angmo-Asan II's father was an Imperial soldier-turned-warlord whose exploits united the nations of Imperia during the Wars of Empire and saved the planet from alien invasion during the Spike War. After his father died, Angmo II ascended to the throne and took the name "Red King".

Angmo as the new king was vastly different to his warrior-like father; he was vain and childlike, desired power and glory, and had no morals on how to achieve them. Before he died, Angmo's father had recognized these traits in his son and decided that Angmo II posed a threat to the planet and its people if he ever took the throne. The king sent his warbound Shadow, [[Hiroim|Hiroim the Shamed]], to assassinate the prince. The only thing that saved the prince's life was Hiroim's unwillingness to kill a child.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #98</ref>

While Angmo was still young he came across the thirteen year old [[Caiera]] whose village was attacked by the Spikes. Using her Old Power and fighting skills she fought the infected of her village until she was saved by the young Red King. The Red King had stood by and allowed her village to be infected in order to find a Shadow with the Old Power. He proceeded to enslave her. She was later freed and officially made the King's bodyguard.<ref name="ReferenceA">''Skaar: Son of Hulk Presents – Savage World of Sakaar #1''</ref> The Red King would go on to have almost all his sons and daughters slaughtered to ensure they could not take the throne from him.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

The Red King still ruled Sakaar when the Hulk was inadvertently exiled to their world. Initially the Hulk was enslaved and trained as a gladiator to fight for the entertainment of the Emperor but he quickly began to gain attention as the Green Scar and Sakaarson, a mythical figure prophesied to rule Sakaar and heal it.

The Red King grew concerned and tried to have the Hulk killed repeatedly to no avail until they entered into open war with one another. The Hulk led his friends the [[Warbound]] and others against the Red King, eventually gaining the support of the King's own bodyguard, Caiera the Oldstrong, who turned against him when the Red King unleashed the Spikes against the Hulk.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #92–99</ref>

The Hulk led his forces on Crown City and personally fought the Red King, seemingly defeating him and stopping the destruction of Crown City caused by the King. At some point after his downfall, the Red King was found by the Wildebots and reconstructed as a Cyborg, leading survivors of Crown City to safety and coming to regret his past actions, feeling that the Hulk had helped him become who he should have been. The Red King followed the Hulk's son [[Skaar (comics)|Skaar]] up until the destruction of the planet. It remains unclear whether or not he survived the planet being consumed by [[Galactus]].

===Red King in other media===
* The Red King appears in ''[[Planet Hulk (film)|Planet Hulk]]'', voiced by [[Mark Hildreth (actor)|Mark Hildreth]]. Unlike the comics, Caiera infects the King with spikes as revenge before leaving him to be slaughtered by his [[Death's Head]] guards.

'''Right-Winger''' (Jerry Johnson) is a veteran and superhero in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

The character, created by [[Mark Gruenwald]] and [[Paul Neary]], first appeared in ''Captain America'' #323 (Nov 1986).

Within the context of the stories, Jerry Johnson was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. He was a veteran who had served 4 years in the U.S. Army with his friend, [[U.S. Agent (comics)|John Walker]]. Both became disillusioned and grew bored due to the lack of action during peace-time service. They both signed up for the [[Power Broker (character)|Power Broker]]'s strength augmentation process, and joined the Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation. Later, John Walker approached him to form a team of superhumans, known as the B.U.C.s (Bold Urban Commandos) or "Buckies". This team consisted of Johnson, [[Battlestar (comics)|Lemar Hoskins]], and [[Left-Winger (comics)|Hector Lennox]], and they all wore variations of [[Captain America]]'s costume.

Walker, now known as the Super-Patriot publicly spoke out against the original Captain America, and the Buckies pretended to be Cap's supporters. The Buckies staged opposition to Walker and pretended to attack him at a rally in [[Central Park]] as a publicity stunt. Walker defeated these protesters and proclaimed to Captain America that the people should decide who was worthy of being Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' #323</ref> Eventually, the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]] selected Walker to replace Steve Rogers as Captain America, and chose Lemar Hoskins to become his partner Bucky (and later as Battlestar).

Lennox and Johnson were left behind, feeling betrayed and angered. They chose the names Left-Winger and Right-Winger respectively. They wore stolen [[Guardsman (comics)|Guardsmen]] armor and battled Walker and Hoskins.<ref name="Captain America #334">''Captain America'' #334</ref> The pair upstaged the new Captain America at a patriotic rally and press conference, attacking him and revealing Walker's identity to the press out of jealousy over his new-found success.<ref>''Captain America'' #341</ref> As a result, Walker's parents were killed by the militia group [[Watchdogs (Marvel Comics)|The Watchdogs]], nearly driving Walker into a mental breakdown. Walker blamed his former partners for his parents' deaths, and he stalked them. When he caught up to Left-Winger and Right-Winger, he tied them to an oil tank which was detonated by a torch-saber and left them to die.<ref>''Captain America'' #347</ref> They barely survived the explosion due to their bodies' enhanced physiology, leaving them terribly burned and in critical condition.

Later, Walker became the [[U.S. Agent (comics)|U.S. Agent]] and joined the [[West Coast Avengers]]. Left-Winger and Right-Winger, alongside several others, were plucked from different time periods by [[Immortus]] to serve in the third [[Legion of the Unliving]]. They battled U.S. Agent, who slew them again not believing them to be authentic.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #61</ref>

Eventually, it was revealed to Walker that the pair had survived the explosion and were hospitalized in Houston. After undergoing painful treatment for the burns they received, they had committed suicide. When Walker learned of this, he was remorseful.<ref>''Captain America'' #381</ref>

==Riot==
'''Riot''' is the name used by a [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] in [[Marvel Comics]]. The symbiote, created by David Michelinie and Ron Lim, first appeared in ''Venom: Lethal Protector'' #4 (May 1993) and was named in ''Carnage, U.S.A.'' #2 (March 2012) after an unrelated purplish-black, four-armed action figure from the ''[[Planet of the Symbiotes]]'' storyline. It was created as one of five symbiote "children" forcefully spawned from the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote along with [[Lasher (comics)|Lasher]], [[Agony (comics)|Agony]], [[Phage (comics)|Phage]], and [[Scream (comics)|Scream]]. Unlike his fellow spawn, Riot primarily sports symbiote hammers and maces.

Riot's first host is '''Trevor Cole''', a mercenary hired by [[Carlton Drake]]'s [[Life Foundation]] in San Francisco. Cole is one of several employees to be bonded with a symbiote, along with Donna Diego (Scream), Leslie Gesneria (Agony), Carl Mach (Phage), and Ramon Hernandez (Lasher). After Riot and his "siblings" are defeated by [[Spider-Man]] and [[Eddie Brock]],<ref>''Venom: Lethal Protector'' #1–5</ref> the symbiotes' hosts kidnap Brock in an attempt to communicate with alien symbiotes. When Brock refuses to aid them, Cole is killed along with Gesneria and Mach. The others initially believe that Brock was picking the group off, but the killer is later revealed to be Diego, having developed schizophrenia from Scream's influence.<ref>''Venom: Separation Anxiety'' #1–4</ref>

The Riot symbiote later merges with Phage, Lasher, and Agony to become the [[Hybrid (Scott Washington)|Hybrid]] symbiote,<ref>''Venom: Along Came a Spider'' #1</ref> but a military group separates them for the U.S. government.{{Issue|date=January 2019}}

Riot's second host is '''Howard Ogden''', a [[Petty Officer]] assigned to the Riot symbiote for the Mercury Team. With [[Cletus Kasady]] on the loose in Colorado, Ogden trains with Riot for months on specific tasks alongside Rico Axelson (Phage), Marcus Simms (Lasher) and James Murphy (Agony).<ref>''Carnage, U.S.A.'' #2–5</ref> Nevertheless, Ogden and his teammates are killed by Carnage in their secret base.<ref>''Deadpool vs. Carnage'' #3</ref> The four symbiotes bond to [[Deadpool]] to fight Carnage before bonding with the Mercury Team's [[War Dog (Marvel Comics)|dog]] after the fight.<ref>''Deadpool vs. Carnage'' #4</ref>

After being possessed by [[Knull (character)|Knull]], Riot and his "siblings" take over a family, with him and Agony taking the father and mother respectively while Phage and Lasher bond to the children before the group head to New York to help in Carnage's quest.<ref>''Absolute Carnage: Separation Anxiety'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref> They hunt Dylan Brock and [[Normie Osborn]], but are defeated and separated from their hosts by the [[Maker (Reed Richards)|Maker]].<ref>''Venom'' Vol. 4 #17–18</ref> 

Riot later fuses with Lasher, Phage, and Agony once more as a fused symbiote to fight [[Mania (character)|Andi Benton]] (Scream), but are defeated. Despite this, the fused symbiote escapes.<ref>''King in Black: Planet of the Symbiotes'' #1</ref>

Riot's fourth and fifth hosts take part in a conspiracy led by the [[Carnage (character)|Carnage]] symbiote. While the first is burnt out, the second assists the other three symbiote enforcers and Carnage until they are defeated by [[Flash Thompson]], Silence, and [[Toxin (comics)|Toxin]] and contained in [[Alchemax]]'s custody.<ref>''Extreme Carnage: Riot'' #1</ref><ref>''Extreme Carnage: Agony'' #1</ref><ref>''Extreme Carnage: Omega'' #1</ref>

Riot faces and overpowers [[Venom (Sony's Spider-Man Universe)|Venom]] in battle before escaping into the Life Foundation's second rocket, but Venom damages it, killing Riot and Drake.

'''Roberta''' is a fictional android in [[Marvel Comics]]. The character, created by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], first appeared in ''Fantastic Four'' #239 (Feb. 1982).

Roberta was created by [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] when he realized that no one would apply to work as the [[Fantastic Four]]'s receptionist. She is known for her calm demeanor in the face of unusual situations and resembles a blonde haired woman with glasses down to the waist, where the rest of her is a machine connected to a desk. She has dealt with the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]],<ref>''The Thing'' #4</ref> [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]],<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #89</ref> [[Kitty Pryde]]<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #178</ref> and John Byrne.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #262</ref> She once took down the [[Trapster]] in one blow.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #265</ref> When [[Kristoff Vernard]] blew up the [[Baxter Building]], he also destroyed Roberta.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #278</ref>

When the Baxter Building was rebuilt, so was Roberta with her memories intact.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #311</ref> She showed some slight confusion over the sight of seeing [[Doctor Doom]] with [[Alicia Masters]] and for once was unsure of what to do.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #318</ref> She was ripped from her circuits by [[Mad Thinker]] when his mind was trapped in the body of the [[Awesome Android]].<ref>''Marvel Fanfare'' #46</ref> Reed was able to rebuild her, however.<ref>''Power Pack'' #57</ref> She once again showed minor interest in the strange going ons around her. She witnessed [[Luke Cage]] drive his car through the Baxter Building and then witnessed him fight the Thing.<ref>''Cage'' 19–20</ref> [[Scott Lang]] has deduced that Roberta is incapable of sarcasm as she cheerfully told Alicia "you're welcome" after it was apparent that her thanks was sarcastic.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #394</ref> She also prefers to call herself a "mechanized human".<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #403</ref>

Roberta received a redesign when the [[Four Freedoms Plaza]] was donated to the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #3</ref> While the original design still had blonde hair and wore glasses, the Four Freedoms Plaza version had black hair while the Thunderbolts Plaza version had long brown hair.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' Vol. 3 #14</ref> Roberta got another redesign, this time she had a full, silvery humanoid body and was first seen meeting with new Fantastic Four writer [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]].<ref>''Marvel Knights: Four'' #23</ref> She has since started dating former killer robot turned assistant mail man [[Elektro (comics)|Elektro]] and the two have since started living together.<ref>''Marvel Monsters: Fin Fang Four''</ref><ref>''Fin Fang Four Return''</ref>

===Roberta in other media===
Roberta appears in ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]'' played by [[Patricia Harras]].

Within the context of the stories, Bernie Rosenthal is a glass blower, wrestling fanatic and studying lawyer.<ref>''Captain America'' #271</ref><ref>''Captain America'' #312</ref> After moving into her friend's apartment building, she met Steve Rogers who secretly was the patriotic superhero Captain America.

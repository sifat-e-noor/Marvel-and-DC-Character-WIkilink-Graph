'''Sunspot''' ('''Roberto da Costa''') is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is most commonly associated with [[X-Men]]-related groups the [[New Mutants]] and [[X-Force]].

A [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] from Brazil, Sunspot possesses the ability to absorb and channel [[solar power]]. He is idealistic and impulsive, but is considered a close friend to many of his teammates. He is initially portrayed as an important member of the X-Men's 1980s-era junior team and its reincarnation X-Force. He later retires as Sunspot and garners a massive fortune that allows him to buy out the organization [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]], which he re-brands to Avengers Idea Mechanics and he operates under the code name '''[[Citizen V]]'''.

[[Adan Canto]] portrays the character in ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past (film)|X-Men: Days of Future Past]]''. [[Henry Zaga]] portrays the character at a younger age, in ''[[The New Mutants (film)|The New Mutants]]''.

==Fictional character biography==

===Origin===
Sunspot, or Roberto da Costa, is a [[Pardo Brazilian]], the son of wealthy Afro-Brazilian businessman Emmanuel da Costa and his white American mother archaeologist Nina da Costa. In ''New Mutants'' #7, his father is described as a very driven man, who "grew up [...] a barefoot houseboy", "by age 20 [...] a millionaire [and] by 30, an economic and political force to be reckoned with." Emmanuel constantly pushes his son to reach for both his physical and intellectual limits. Thanks to his father's encouragement, Roberto rose to the position of star [[soccer]] player at school<ref name=MGN4>''Marvel Graphic Novel'' #4</ref> and was considered by recruiters for the [[Olympic Games]].

When Roberto was playing a soccer game with his team, racist members of the opposing team assaulted him, and Roberto responded by initiating a fight on the field. While taking a brutal beating, his mutant powers manifested, suddenly transforming him into a creature of solid black solar energy. Surprised and terrified, people abandoned the stadium, and only his girlfriend Juliana stayed.<ref name=MGN4 />

===New Mutants===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Marfan027sun.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Sunspot in his original outfit from ''Marvel Fanfare #27''. Art By Bob McLeod]] -->
Within a matter of days, a mutant-hating faction led by [[Donald Pierce]] and employing [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] mercenaries kidnap Juliana, luring Roberto into a trap. He engages the [[Reavers (comics)|kidnappers]], but is eventually defeated when his power reserve runs out. Other mutants named [[Karma (comics)|Karma]] and [[Danielle Moonstar|Psyche]] rescue him. In the course of the following battle, Juliana sacrifices her life for Roberto, jumping in front of a bullet meant for him.<ref name="MGN4"/>

After the rescue, Roberto joins Karma and Psyche in pursuit of Donald Pierce. The three are joined by [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]], and after the battle by Sam Guthrie, a.k.a. [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], one of Pierce's misguided mutant hirelings, despite initial reservations from the others. [[Professor X]] offers to train the five teenagers in controlling their nascent mutant powers, which they accept and become the founding members of the group known as the [[New Mutants]], a group of junior [[X-Men]].<ref name="MGN4"/> Although [[Professor Xavier]]'s intentions are for them to only be students, over the course of the ''New Mutants'' ongoing series, they grow into superheroes, and they travel to such locations as space, Asgard, and the Amazon, as well as the past and the future. During his tenure with the New Mutants, he and Sam become best friends.

Sunspot was at one point injected with the drug that helped create [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]], and he briefly became a monster.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up Annual'' #6</ref> Sunspot was later reunited with his parents, and then with the New Mutants he visited Nova Roma.<ref>''New Mutants'' #9–11</ref> He then encountered the [[Emma Frost|White Queen]] and her [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]] for the first time.<ref>''New Mutants'' #16–17</ref> He was later abducted and forced to serve as one of the Gladiators.<ref>''New Mutants'' #29–31</ref> On another adventure with the New Mutants, he visited the land of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]].<ref>''New Mutants Special Edition'' #1; ''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #9</ref> Alongside the New Mutants, he later fought [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]]'s father, the [[Magus (Technarchy)|Magus]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #50</ref> He also battled [[Cameron Hodge]] and the [[Right (comics)|Right]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #60</ref> Alongside the New Mutants he battled [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]].<ref name="New Mutants #65">''New Mutants'' #65</ref> He also fell in love with the alien [[Gosamyr]].<ref name="New Mutants #65"/>

===X-Force===
<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:xforce46.jpg|150px|thumb|Cover to ''X-Force'' #46 featuring Sunspot and [[Mimic (comics)|Mimic]].]]  -->
When the [[time travel]]ing [[antihero]] [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] takes over the New Mutants and turns them into the [[paramilitary]] group X-Force, Sunspot parts ways with the team.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol.1 #99</ref> During this time Sunspot is tutored by [[Gideon (comics)|Gideon]] of the [[Externals]], an old business partner of Roberto's father (who has since died). Suspecting Sunspot to be a fellow External, he takes Sunspot under his wing.<ref>''New Mutants'' #98</ref> Gideon ends up experimenting on Sunspot, granting him new powers such as flight and the ability to fire blasts of solar energy.<ref>''X-Force'' #14–17</ref> For a time, Sunspot becomes lost in a [[space-time continuum]] after interfering with the [[teleportation]] powers of [[Locus (comics)|Locus]].<ref>''X-Force'' #28</ref> During this time, a villain called [[Reignfire]] comes onto the scene, showing a remarkable similar appearance to Sunspot.<ref>''X-Force'' #28 (1993) through ''X-Force'' #43 (1995)</ref>

===Reignfire===
{{Main|Reignfire}}
The villain Reignfire first appears <ref>''X-Force'' #26 (1993)</ref> before Sunspot's mysterious disappearance in ''X-Force'' #28 (1993), when he assumes command of the [[Mutant Liberation Front]].  [[Dani Moonstar]], who had infiltrated the MLF, sees Reignfire without his mask and believes him to be Sunspot,<ref>''X-Force'' Annual #3 (1994)</ref> and in a battle with X-Force, Reignfire even removes his mask to reveal himself as Sunspot.<ref>''X-Force'' #43 (1995)</ref> The moment was interrupted by the [[Age of Apocalypse]]<ref>Occurring between ''X-Force'' #43 and #44 (1995)</ref> and when reality is restored, Cable 'heals' Sunspot of this persona dominating his body,<ref>Off panel between ''X-Force'' #43 and 44 (1995)</ref> transferring some of his [[Askani]] knowledge into Sunspot, allowing Sunspot to speak the Askani language and know of their meditation techniques.<ref>''Cable'' vol. 1 #29 (1996)</ref> In an incident where X-Force reconnected with former teammate [[Skids (comics)|Skids]], it is discovered that Reignfire is actually a protoplasmic mutant symbiote injected with Sunspot's blood.<ref>''X-Force'' #78-80 (1998)</ref> Reignfire is seemingly permanently defeated when Sunspot leeches him of his powers, reducing him to his original protoplasmic state which is then claimed by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]<ref>''X-Force'' #80 (1998)</ref>

===X-Force Roadtrip===
Roberto later joins the rest of X-Force on an extended road trip, separating themselves from Cable. Along the way, they meet several problems, including Roberto's money being tied up in litigation, forcing the team into doing a variety of odd jobs. One included providing protection for a small businessman being hassled by elements of the mob. During this time, Roberto has a short fling with Sam's girlfriend [[Tabitha Smith]], a teammate.<ref>''X-Force'' #75–92</ref>

===Hellfire Club===
Later during his X-Force career, Roberto is approached by [[Selene (comics)|Selene]] of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]. She offers Roberto his deceased father Emmanuel's seat in the Club's Inner Circle, as the seats are inherited.<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 1 #94, 97</ref>  She promises Roberto that she will resurrect Juliana if he joins and he agrees.{{Issue|date=January 2012}} Selene keeps her part of the bargain, but only to a certain extent. She does bring back the spirit of Juliana, but inserts it into the body of a [[coma]]tose girl.{{Issue|date=January 2012}} Possibly because he felt obliged to fulfill his promise, Roberto decides to stay, becoming Selene's Black Rook.{{Issue|date=January 2012}}  Roberto attempts to contact the resurrected Juliana, but seeing she has no memory of her previous life, he decides to leave her alone.<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 1 #98–100</ref>

With no explanation given, Roberto next surfaces in the title ''X-Treme X-Men'' as the head of the [[Los Angeles]] branch of [[X-Corporation]], along with former New Mutant [[Magma (comics)|Magma]] and former [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellion]] [[Empath (comics)|Empath]].{{Issue|date=January 2012}} Roberto's ties to the Hellfire Club are not however severed, as [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] approaches, having taken over the position of Hellfire Club's Lord Imperial and wanting Roberto as his Black King. Shaw claims that he is trying to turn the Club into a force of good, so Roberto accepts, though he keeps his involvement with Shaw a secret.{{Issue|date=March 2011}}

Soon after, Shaw is injured in battle by Donald Pierce.{{Issue|date=January 2012}} His injuries make him incapable of overseeing the Hellfire Club. Roberto takes over as Lord Imperial.{{Issue|date=January 2012}} At his side is  [[Sage (comics)|Sage]] who leaves the X-Men to make sure Roberto is not corrupted by the power he wields.{{Issue|date=January 2012}} After the events of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] calls for the shutting down of all branches of the X-Corporation to better pool the resources of the X-Men.{{Issue|date=January 2012}} In [[X-Men: Endangered Species|Endangered Species]], Sebastian Shaw seems to be thinking of reclaiming his place and to be quite mad at Sunspot.{{Issue|date=March 2011}}

===Secret Invasion===
During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, Sunspot is among the several X-Men helping to fight off Skrulls during their invasion of San Francisco.<ref>''Secret Invasion: X-Men'' #1</ref>

===Young X-Men===
Sunspot, who remains Lord Imperial of the Hellfire Club, is revealed by Cyclops to belong to the newest incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] along with [[Danielle Moonstar]], Cannonball, and Magma.<ref>''Young X-Men'' #1</ref> However, while battling members of Cyclops' new team of [[Young X-Men|X-Men]] alongside Cannonball, there is much confusion after [[Rockslide (comics)|Rockslide]] makes reference to the two mutants' membership in the Brotherhood.  During the course of the battle, Sunspot is seriously wounded by [[Wolf Cub (comics)|Wolf Cub]], who slashes Roberto's face and stomach with his claws.<ref>''Young X-Men'' #3</ref>  It is eventually revealed that "Cyclops" is in reality [[Donald Pierce]], the former White King of the Hellfire Club, who is posing as the X-Men leader using an image inducer.<ref>''Young X-Men'' #4</ref>  Pierce's reasons for recruiting these "X-Men" is currently unknown, but it appears that his primary focus is to eliminate the Lord Imperial and utilized the ruse that Sunspot and his allies formed a new Brotherhood in order to convince the former [[X-Mansion|Xavier students]] to attack their former teachers and allies.

Later on, Sunspot leaves the Hellfire Club and joins the X-Men in San Francisco as noted by Sebastian Shaw who is currently looking for a replacement. Cyclops later asks Sunspot and Danielle Moonstar to help train the [[Young X-Men]] and both accepted.<ref>''Young X-Men'' #6</ref>

===Reforming the New Mutants===
After receiving an anonymous tip in Colorado about a young mutant endangering a small town, Dani and Shan are sent to investigate and calm the locals. During their mission, Magik reappears back at the X-Men's base in San Francisco after teleporting off into the future after the events of "X-Infernus". Upon her return she informs Sam and Roberto that Shan and Dani are in trouble and it will result in their deaths. Sam assembles a team consisting of himself, Sunspot, Magma, and Magik to go find them. While searching for them, Sam and Roberto come across a tied up and comatose Shan in the back of a bar, while Magik and Magma are tricked into freeing [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]] from a box, who apparently has Shan's personality imprisoned inside of him.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #1</ref> Roberto and Sam approach Karma's body but when Roberto gets too close he almost gets pulled into Legion's mind. After they leave the bar, they find they're surrounded by police; Roberto and Sam fly away to the jail to find Dani.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #2</ref>

When they arrive, Legion is trying to kill Dani. After Roberto and Sam repel him, Legion comes back and Sunspot fights him. Cannonball soon joins him and they fend him off and regroup.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #3</ref> During the fight, Legion takes on Magma, Cannonball, and Roberto, who gets seriously injured when Legion slashes him with a shard of metal.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #4</ref>

During an eight month time-skip, Roberto engages in a hostile takeover of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]] and gets rid of the villainous upper management.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 5 #35 (Sept. 2014)</ref> Roberto then uses the resources of A.I.M. to intervene in the conflict between the forces of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Illuminati, while also sending a team of Avengers to deal with the multiversal threat of the Incursions. <ref>''Avengers'' vol. 5 #36 (Oct. 2014)</ref>

===[[The New Avengers (comics)#Volume 4 (2015–2016)|New Avengers]]===
After the events of ''Secret War'', Roberto re-tools A.I.M. into Avengers Idea Mechanics, hiring various superheroes as a new Avengers team consisting of Hawkeye, Songbird, Squirrel Girl, Hulking, Wiccan, Power Man and White Tiger.

However, it transpires Roberto has also seen these attacks coming, aided by Songbird playing double agent, and manipulates both sides so that W.H.I.S.P.E.R. is destroyed and the Maker imprisoned. It is also revealed that Roberto has become exposed to a cloud of terrigen mist, which is toxic to Mutants, and every use of his powers now accelerates Roberto's aging. With the Maker captured, Roberto strikes a deal with the US government to round up the remaining rogue branches of A.I.M.. <ref>''New Avengers'' vol 4. #12-17 (2017)</ref> The operation is successful. In the middle of this, Roberto presents Wiccan and Hulkling with a parting gift of an expensive apartment. <ref>''New Avengers'' vol 4. #18 (2017)</ref>

===U.S.Avengers===
Following the deal that would get the Avengers Idea Mechanics to merge with the U.S. government as the American Intelligence Mechanics, Sunspot began to lead the [[U.S.Avengers]] under the alias of [[Citizen V]].<ref>''U.S. Avengers'' #1</ref> Their first mission takes place at the [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]]'s floating volcanic island base. [[Robert Maverick|Red Hulk]] crash-landed into the floating volcanic island base, hard enough to destroy it. They're later approached by a future version of [[Danielle Cage]] as Captain America, who tells them that her nemesis, the Golden Skull, came to their timeline to steal all the wealth. In [[Miami, Florida]], the team crash a charity gala only to discover that the wealthy CEO's were kidnapped and replaced by robots. During the battle, the team manages to defeat and capture the Golden Skull, who was wearing a golden armored suit. Danielle then goes back to her timeline with the Golden Skull as her prisoner. Sunspot then sends Red Hulk to confront and defeat an out-of-control American Kaiju, who was attacking [[Europe]].<ref>''U.S. Avengers'' #2-4</ref>

During the "Opening Salvo" part of the ''[[Secret Empire (comic book)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Captain America, whose memory was altered by Red Skull's clone using the powers of [[Kobik]], has a meeting with Roberto da Costa and tells him that he is no longer in charge of the team. Roberto then sees footage of the supervillain attacks in Manhattan, deep space, and in Europe.<ref>''U.S.Avengers'' #5</ref> At the beginning of the takeover, Roberto assembles the team until he is attacked by one of his scientists who has allied with [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]]. He's later seen in a prison cell, nearly dead, by Red Hulk and [[Iron Patriot|Toni Ho]]. While adjusting to prison life, Toni manages to heal Roberto just in time when Hydra soldiers show up at their cell. Roberto then manages to use his powers to defeat the guards and free Red Hulk from the nanites controlling him, allowing them to take control of the prison.<ref>''U.S.Avengers'' #6-9</ref> In the aftermath of the event, Roberto, during a meeting with the team's new congressional liaison in the White House, resigns from his position despite the objections from the senator. He then meets [[Smasher (comics)|Izzy Kane]], [[Cannonball]]'s wife, who tells him that Cannonball, who went missing in action during the takeover and was presumed dead, is still alive on another planet.<ref>''U.S.Avengers'' #10</ref>

While travelling through space, Smasher and the U.S.Avengers are attacked by space pirates known as warpjackers. After a brief fight, the pirates tell them that Glenbrook is actually a planet named Kral X and that its ruler, Ritchie Redwood, is ruthless.<ref>''U.S.Avengers'' #11</ref> Arriving on Kral X, the heroes manage to help Cannonball and the planet's rebels in overthrowing Ritchie. After restoring order to the planet, the heroes head home.<ref>''U.S.Avengers'' #12</ref>

Later, at the Hellfire Gala, Sunspot, disappointed for not been chosen to join the prestigious X-Men team, decided after a few drink with his drinking mates to create a new, secret team!{{issue|date=February 2022}}

Sunspot is later contacted by Lady Deathbird about a threat to Empress Xandra’s life. Sunspot has been bragging that he is the leader of the X-Men and the Empress needs their help. Sunspot tells Cannonball that he wants to create a team and already has people lined up: Sunspot himself, Cannonball, Banshee, Boom-Boom, Armor, Tempo, Marrow and Strong Guy. After this new team and Forge agree to accept the mission, Sunspot reveals that it is for The Shi'ar Empress. Sunspot and Cannonball meet with Gladiator. Gladiator revealed many people have betrayed the Empress because she is considered too young to lead. They also tell the team that Deathbird and the Empress are missing. Sunspot leads his team into space, and Forge makes them matching outfits. But during their travels, they are attacked by Sidri bounty hunters, but Banshee repels them. Forge creates an algorithm to find Deathbird’s ship. Using Tempo’s powers, they can run the program thousands of times in only a few minutes. After a weird psychic puzzle, the group arrives on a planet and meets with the Empress, Deathbird, and two advisors. After a brief talk, the group is under attack, and Deathbird is hit with a teleport mine. Sunspot, who is upset that his target was hurt, uses his ability to destroy the ship of his assailants. As the Secret X-Men leaves, the Empress erases their memory of Deathbird’s disappearance.<ref>''The Secret X-Men'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:XMEN SunspotPowerup.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Sunspot's energized state.<br/>''New Mutants'' #6<br/>Art by [[Diogenes Neves]].]]
Sunspot is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] whose cells have the ability to absorb [[solar energy]] and convert it for use as physical strength. He is also able to create thermal updrafts for flight, project heat and light, as well as concussive blasts of solar energy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Marvel Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded}}</ref> At will, he is able to take on a superhuman "powered up" form that is entirely nonreflective black, save for his eyes and teeth which turn a solid bright white. Though the color black optimizes solar absorption, he absorbs solar power at all times, not only when he is in his "powered up" form. If he has not absorbed sufficient amounts of solar energy in normal form, he will be too weak to "power up". Likewise, when not in direct sunlight, use of his superhuman strength rapidly exhausts the stores of energy within his body.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Buchanan|first=Bruce |title=The New Mutants: From Superhero Spin-Off to Sci-Fi/Fantasy|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=29 |page=63|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=August 2008|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref>

When in his solar form, Sunspot also has a [[solar corona|corona]] effect, an aura that has been depicted in multiple ways, though two predominant conventions exist for its portrayal: one is that the air close to him manifests black globes of various sizes, reminiscent of [[Kirby dots]], and the other is a unified field glowing a bright yellow or white.  Although Sunspot can absorb energy from stars and reflected solar energy from the moon, the amounts that reach him on Earth are too minuscule to add significantly to his power. In other regions, such as [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], his power is significantly enhanced, allowing him - with much effort - to lift [[Volstagg]] off the ground for a few seconds before suffering a backache.<ref>''New Mutants Special Edition'' #1 (Dec. 1985)</ref>

Originally, Sunspot's superhuman power was limited solely to superhuman strength and enhanced durability, and then only in his solar form. Unlike many superhumanly strong heroes, Sunspot was unique in that his physical resistance to impact only increased somewhat when he employed his superhuman strength, and he was not bulletproof by any means. The phrase, "Careful Bobby, you're strong, not invulnerable!" or variations was seen many times. In addition, Sunspot's powers have radically changed and grown since the character was introduced; he can now withstand the force of a speeding eighteen-wheeler traveling at speeds of 100&nbsp;mph, alongside surviving an A.I.M explosive charge latched onto his side.<ref>''Avengers World'' Vol. 1 #18</ref>

Sunspot maintained his original powerset for roughly the first ten years of his existence, remaining a super strong but vulnerable individual throughout the entire ''New Mutants'' series. During the mid-1990s in ''X-Force'' his powers began to change, under writer [[Fabian Nicieza]]. Nicieza had the supervillain Gideon capture Roberto and subject him to experimentation where the limits of Roberto's power absorption were tested by feeding him immense amounts of solar power. Roberto was rescued by X-Force, but the overload had permanently altered his powers in such a way that he was now able to release concussive blasts of solar energy, with a considerable heat and light projection component; this experimentation also made him immune to all types of heat and fire. He can also now absorb other forms of energy; such as heat, light or even radiation in a manner similar to photo/radio- or thermokinesis. It was believed they do not power up his abilities but this was proven false.<ref>''Hulk'' Vol 3 #3</ref><ref name="Avengers World Vol. 1 #19">''Avengers World'' Vol. 1 #19</ref> Sunspot also has some capacity to manipulate light based energy effects, but it remains a largely unexplored portent of his mutant power.<ref name="Avengers World Vol. 1 #19"/> It has been debated that Roberto would have reached these levels of his abilities of his own accord, and that Gideon's experimentation only increased his evolution process.

The fact that the solar blasts were concussive in origin led directly into ''X-Force'' #28, where Sunspot thinks of using them as a means of propulsion, and thus fly by blasting in the opposite direction of where he wanted to go – initially leaving a slight trail behind him, but in later years, Roberto would learn to use the propulsion more subtly – to appear to hover in place with no blast wake at all other than his usual "powered up" corona effect. His capacity to fly has similarly been enhanced as he is able to breach planetary orbit and reach Saturn's belt with relative ease.<ref>''Hulk'' Vol 3 #3-4</ref>

Sunspot also had the rituals and ideas of the [[Askani]] inside his head, due to a telepathic contact with Cable. While being strongly influenced by it for a while, the memories seem to have faded.

Significant non-superhuman abilities include business administration, as he owns and runs a multibillion-dollar international conglomerate. He is an Olympic-class athlete as the result of having been trained in combat by the X-Men and later by Cable. He is an expert in many languages (see below) and has an assortment of other more minor talents such as piloting aircraft. He was trained in swordsmanship by the Gladiators, and is also an excellent soccer player.

Afterward he has joined Emma Frost's [[New Mutants|Academy of Tomorrow]], a school for gifted beings. Initially, Roberto is confused as he knows his grades are not impressive.

He works with [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]] and [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]].

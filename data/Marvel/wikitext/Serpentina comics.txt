'''''X-Men 2099''''' is a [[comic book]] [[Ongoing series|series]] published by [[Marvel Comics]] from [[1993 in comics|1993]] to [[1996 in comics|1996]] that chronicled the adventures of an [[X-Men]] team in the year 2099. It extends the [[Marvel 2099]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]], which features other future versions of popular [[List of Marvel Comics characters|Marvel characters]], such as [[Spider-Man 2099]] and [[Hulk 2099]]. The series was written by [[John Francis Moore (comics)|John Francis Moore]] and largely pencilled by [[Ron Lim]].

The series began in October 1993 and lasted 35 issues along with two specials. It spawned a line of [[action figure]]s, mostly featuring the more popular characters in the book. In issue #20, the title received a minor makeover, officially joining the [[Marvel 2099|2099 imprint]] and changing its name to ''X-Men 2099 A.D.'', the "A.D." standing for "After [[Doom 2099|Doom]]". At the series' end, it was folded into ''[[2099: World of Tomorrow]]'', though members of the team were rarely seen after that point.

The first issue featured a blue foil cover on cardstock and the double-sized 25th issue's cover was extra-glossy with foil letters, metallic silver ink, and embossed characters on a heavier wraparound cover.

In June 2009, a mini-series called ''[[Timestorm 2009–2099]]'' brought back Spider-Man, [[Ghost Rider 2099|Ghost Rider]], the X-Men, and more from the 2099 universe in a very different version.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19763 | title=Exclusive: Timestorm 2009/2099 Designs | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=January 30, 2009}}</ref>

In 2016, the original version returned in the Spider-Man 2099 arc "Civil War 2099" (also appearing in X-Men '92 series).
Later the team appeared again in X-Men Blue, helping the original time displaced X-Men.

==Main Characters==
The team featured an ever-changing line-up, but the mainstays included:

* '''[[Xi'an (comics)|Desert Ghost]]''' (Xi'an Chi Xan) – Founder. His right hand was green and covered in scales, and endowed with the ability to break down the molecular structures of substances, thus destroying them; his left hand appeared to be solid gold and had the ability to repair molecular structures, although his use of this power was taxing. He also had the power to generate a protective [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoon]], while regenerating and healing. Xi'an was formerly a member of the Lawless gang, who later defected to the Theatre of Pain.
* '''[[Skullfire]]''' (Timothy "Fitz" Fitzgerald) – Leader. Initial electrical energy absorption and redirection later developed into absorption and redirection of any energy source; ambient, magical, or otherwise.
* '''[[Bloodhawk]]''' (Lemuel Krug) – Able to assume a superhuman form at will that included tough, scale-like red skin, sharp talons, and leathery wings. Never a permanent member of the team, but came and went when needed.
* '''[[Meanstreak (comics)|Meanstreak]]''' (Henri Huang) – Superspeed and a heightened [[metabolism]] to prevent his speed from adversely affecting his body. Former Alchemax researcher and star scientist.
* '''[[Metalhead (comics)|Metalhead]]''' (Edward van Beethoven-Osako) – His skin could take on the properties of any [[metal]] he came into [[tactition|tactile]] contact with. Body warped and lost ability to return to human skin due to a [[mutation]] caused by the touch of Freakshow member Contagion.
* '''[[Cerebra]]''' (Shakti Haddad) – Able to psionically "read" and manipulate the nervous systems of others, allowing her to sense the unique bio-signatures of other mutants and control or disable the brain functions of living beings. She could use her power to trigger the latent powers of other mutants.
* '''[[Krystalin]]''' (Ruth Kirsten Porter-Ogada) – Pulls [[mineral]]s out of the air and condenses them into hard [[crystal]]line shapes of any design she could imagine.
* '''[[Junkpile (comics)|Junkpile]]''' – Techno-organic metabolism increases his strength and durability and allows him to [[psychokinesis|telekinetically]] draw metallic objects to himself and use them to rebuild his body or add to his physical mass making him unusually resistant to harm. Former member of the Lawless gang. Betrayed team in the second issue, but was later appointed to the new [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] by President Doom.
* '''[[La Lunatica]]''' – [[Energy vampire|Psychic vampire]] that fed on dark emotions. Feeding increased her strength and resistance to harm. Chalk white skin and hair as well as red eyes. Initially an instrument of the [[Theatre of Pain (comics)|Theatre of Pain]], but after her release fell in love with Skullfire and reformed to become a member of the X-Men.
* '''[[Serpentina (comics)|Serpentina]]''' (Kimberly Kristine Potters) – Negation field renders her [[bone]]s, [[tissue (biology)|tissue]], and [[muscle]]s pliant so that she can stretch them to extended lengths. Killed during first story arc (issue #3). Body was reanimated later in series as a barely conscious [[zombie]] (issue #26).

==Fictional character biography==
Edward Whelan suffered severe physical and sexual [[child abuse|abuse]] as a child from his father.<ref name="SSM178">''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #178-184. Marvel Comics.</ref> As an adult, he became a [[geneticist]] working for [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]] and [[Primus (Marvel Comics)|Primus]] I (who was impersonating [[Arnim Zola]]). After being subjected to an experiment by Primus, his skin becomes a light pinkish fur color and he is mutated into a cannibalistic, humanoid rat. Vermin is defeated by [[Captain America]] and turned over to [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]<ref>''Captain America'' #272. Marvel Comics.</ref> He escapes S.H.I.E.L.D., however, and returns to the service of Zola and Zemo. Vermin is shackled by Zemo with Captain America in a dungeon; he battles, mutates, escapes, and wounds Zemo.<ref>''Captain America'' #275-278. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Vermin later battles Captain America and Spider-Man at a street festival and is captured.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #128. Marvel Comics.</ref> Some time later, Vermin kidnaps women off the streets into the sewers, and devours them. He is defeated and captured by [[Kraven the Hunter]] disguised as Spider-Man; Kraven sought to prove himself superior to Spider-Man by defeating Vermin alone when Spider-Man needed Captain America to help him. He is forced by Kraven to battle the real Spider-Man, then allowed to escape; he is finally captured and turned over to the police by Spider-Man.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #31-32; ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #293-294; ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #131-132. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the breakout from the supervillain prison the [[Vault (Marvel Comics)|Vault]], Vermin assists [[Eddie Brock|Venom]] in hunting down Warden Marsh. Under Venom's orders, Vermin later teams with [[Powderkeg (character)|Powderkeg]] and [[Mentallo]]; they temporarily defeat [[Iron Man]] and [[Hank Pym]]. Mentallo's powers are used to neutralize the break out.<ref>''Avengers: Deathtrap, The Vault'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Vermin eventually escapes the asylum, and attacks his parents at their home in Scarsdale. He is captured by Spider-Man and returned to psychiatric care. In response to treatment from Dr. Ashley Kafka, he temporarily reverts to his human form.<ref name="SSM178"/>

Under continued treatment from Dr. Kafka, Whelan's original human form eventually becomes his default state, and he only changes to Vermin for a few hours at a time. He and Kafka are [[kidnap]]ped by a group of other Zemo mutants, who want Whelan to become Vermin again and lead them in their quest for revenge. Instead, Whelan persuades them to surrender themselves for psychiatric treatment so that they can be cured as he was. However, Baron Zemo uses a mind-control device to take control of the mutates and revert Whelan to Vermin, intending to use them as subjects for further experiments. His will strengthened by his psychiatric care, Whelan partially reverts to human form and attacks Zemo. Dr. Kafka convinces him to not kill Zemo, and by letting go of his hate Whelan allows "Vermin" to finally die. No longer confined to psychiatric institutions, he submits to trial for his crimes as Vermin. Top defense attorney [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]] agrees to be his lawyer for the case.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #194-196. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Whelan reverts to his Vermin state once again when he teams up with Bloodscream to fight Wolverine.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #170. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Vermin's strength was enhanced by the experimental mutagenic process designed by [[Arnim Zola]], and forced upon him. His agility, reflexes, and durability are roughly equivalent to the absolute peak attainable for the human body but, unlike his strength, speed and stamina, they do not reach superhuman levels. He has extremely acute senses, particularly his sense of smell. Vermin has inch-long claw-like fingernails, razor-sharp pointed teeth, and fur covering most of his body, giving him the appearance of a humanoid rat. Eventually, Vermin gained the ability to revert to human form at will.

Vermin has the ability to control rats and stray dogs within a two-mile (3&nbsp;km) radius of his person. It has not been clearly explained how he does this but some writers have implied it might be hyper-sonic communication.

Though Vermin has no formal martial arts training, he utilizes bestial ferocity, animal cunning, and instincts which make him a very formidable hand-to-hand combatant. He once bested Spider-Man in a physical struggle, but [[Kraven the Hunter]] prevented Vermin from killing Spider-Man.

===Special skills===
Before being altered by Zola, Whelan was an accomplished geneticist.  As Vermin, his intellect is reduced to a childlike (yet cunning) level and he suffers from paranoid delusions.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
*In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Edward Whelan used to work for [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] before its dissolution, which led to him living in the sewers where he had a psychic connection with Agent Crock. Vermin and Agent Crock ruled the sewers with an iron fist until they encountered the Young Ultimates during their search for [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]]. After being unable to reason with them, [[Alternative versions of Kitty Pryde#Shadowcat|Shadowcat]] phased through Agent Crock's head enough to kill him and even Vermin as a side effect of their psychic connection.<ref>''All-New Ultimates'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==In other media==
===Video games===
* Vermin was originally going to appear in the sewer in the 1995 ''[[Spider-Man (1995 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' video game. His sprite was given hair in the final versions of the game.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}
* Vermin appears in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' video game, with his vocal effects provided by [[Steve Blum]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} This version is an ordinary rat who was injected with human DNA by Edward Whelan,<ref>http://zoknowsgaming.com/2012/06/17/meet-villains-the-amazing-spider-man-video-game/</ref> under the supervision of [[Alistair Smythe]], who provided him with the notes of [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]]. The rat mutated overnight and bit Whelan, who then developed rat-like symptoms, before retreating to the sewers. In the game, Vermin is among the cross-species experiments that go berserk after sensing Peter Parker's spider DNA, and subsequently escape from [[Oscorp]]. In the process, Vermin bites and infects several scientists, including [[Gwen Stacy]], with the deadly virus all cross-species are carrying. Later, Spider-Man finds Vermin and chases him through the sewers, due to Dr. Connors requiring a blood sample from a cross-species to synthesize an antidote for the virus. Despite interferences from Oscorp's cross-species hunting Sentries, Spider-Man eventually defeats Vermin and collects a blood sample.

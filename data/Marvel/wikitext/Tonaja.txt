== Super-Inhumans ==
In the wake of ''[[Death of the Inhumans]]'', it is revealed that the Kree had created a new race of Inhumans which was dubbed as '''Super-Inhumans'''. This new race was engineered from birth to possess almost all of their Inhuman abilities and none of their humanity, something the Kree thought to be problematic.

'''Vox'''&nbsp;– The first and currently the only member of this race, he is described as the "voice and the wrath of the gods and the full-throated scream of the Kree Empire". Besides his great powers, he also wields a scythe consisting of a handle and blade made of an unknown kind of red energy and a small sharp dagger. His costume also possess a similar resemblance to that of Ahura Boltagon from the "[[Earth X]]" reality. Vox is later revealed to be actually a program designed by the Kree which is forcefully imprinted on some selected Inhumans. When the program was activated those who were selected would lose all of their identities and free will and are genetically transformed into Vox, obedient deadly hunters. Black Bolt ended up wiping out the entire Vox army, but not without some Kree escaping the slaughter. The program was apparently used in the Supreme Intelligence as Vox reappeared now wearing an emerald costume instead of the black one with crimson highlights, and calling himself as Vox Supreme. He fights Carol Danvers and forces her to kill the Avengers.

Aside from himself, Gordon can also teleport others so long as he is making direct contact with them.

The Hive killed and possessed these sacrifices, and also wiped out the civilisation which used to live on Maveth. During a mission to rescue the Hive in mid-season 3, Hydra's new leader Grant Ward was killed by Phil Coulson while Will Daniels' body (inhabited by the Hive) was destroyed by Leo Fitz.

* '''[[Lash (comics)|Lash/Andrew Garner]]'''&nbsp;– An Inhuman tracking other Inhumans who underwent [[Terregenesis]] from Jiaying's booby trapped ledger.

In the aftermath of the war, Campbell attempted to start a new peaceful life, but was forced to go into hiding when he was pursued by a murderous Inhuman named Lash and the ATCU.

Later, he summoned a metal pipe by directing his hand towards it, using it as a blunt weapon against Morse. As the head of security for the ATCU and the personal bodyguard of Gideon Malick, Giyera has extensive knowledge of martial arts. He chose to fight Bobbi Morse without his powers and gave her a competitive battle that was disrupted by Lance Hunter's interference. Giyera was later killed by Leo Fitz using a special gun that was in stealth mode.
* '''Raina'''&nbsp;– A former member of Project Centipede who after the Terrigenesis became a thorn-covered Inhuman with claws and yellow eyes. She has also gained enhanced strength and durability.

'''Jane Foster''' is a [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was introduced as a love interest of the superhero [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor Odinson]] until becoming a superhero in her own right. Created by writers [[Stan Lee]] and [[Larry Lieber]], and artist [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #84 (September 1962). For many years, Foster was a [[Nursing|nurse]], employed by Dr. Donald Blake, Thor's first mortal host, before becoming a [[Doctor (title)|doctor]] herself. Foster is later revealed to be deemed worthy to [[wikt:wield|wield]] Thor's hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]] when the former is no longer able. During this period, she adopts the mantle of '''Thor''', and joins the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. Foster's stint as Thor ends with the character sacrificing her life and the mantle reverting to the original Thor. After [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Brunnhilde]] and the rest of the [[Valkyrior]] are killed during "[[The War of the Realms]]" storyline, Foster takes up the mantle of '''Valkyrie'''. The character has also appeared in various media adaptations of Thor.

==Fictional character history==
===Early history===
Jane Nelson, known by her more common name of Jane Foster, was a nurse for Dr. Donald Blake, eventually developing feelings for him and Thor, not knowing that they were one and the same. The love triangle went on for a while until Thor revealed his secret identity to Foster, which caused [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] to punish him though he was forgiven after saving Asgard, and in return Thor even took her to Asgard with him.<ref>''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #125 (Feb. 1966). Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> There, Foster was briefly granted immortality and the power of gods, until she failed to pass the tests of courage set forth by Odin when she showed fear battling the monstrous Unknown. Odin then strips Foster of her new powers and returns her to Earth, with no memory of Thor or her time in Asgard, where she meets her new love Dr. Keith Kincaid, who resembles Blake. Meanwhile, in Asgard Odin reunites Thor with his childhood love, [[Sif (Marvel Comics)|Sif]].<ref>''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' #136 (Jan. 1967). Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

===Physician===
Foster appears again in the second Thor volume; now a doctor herself, she is in a position of authority over several New York paramedics, including Jake Olsen. Unbeknownst to her, Jake and Thor have become merged, which creates many conflicts. In one instance, Olsen ignores medical orders and utilizes Thor's (Blake's) knowledge to perform a complicated procedure on a critically ill man.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2 #5 (Nov. 1998). Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

Later, Foster becomes involved in a police case against Olsen, who is accused of stealing drugs.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2 #15–16 (Sept-Oct 1999). Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> She also examines [[Nomad (comics)#Jack Monroe|Jack Monroe]], who stated that he sought her out due to her familiarity with superhuman patients. She later informed Monroe that he was dying due to the effects of the Super-Soldier Serum he had ingested as a youth.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 5 #7. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

During the 2006 "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" storyline Foster takes [[Captain America]]'s side against the registration act and joins his resistance group, the Secret Avengers. She operates from SHIELD safe-house number 23. She is also seen in issue 4, helping to assist a beaten [[Spider-Man]].

===Return===
Shortly after divorcing her husband and subsequently losing custody of her child, Jimmy Kincaid, Foster hears rumors of the return of Dr. Donald Blake and Thor.

===Cancer and becoming Thor===
Following the deaths of her ex-husband and son in a car accident,<ref>''Thor'' #704</ref> Foster is diagnosed with breast cancer,<ref>''Thor: God of Thunder'' #12. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> and accepts an invitation from Thor to represent Midgard in the Congress of the Worlds on Asgard. She undergoes therapy but refuses all magical treatments.<ref>''Thor: God of Thunder'' #24. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

During the 2014 "[[Original Sin (comics)|Original Sin]]" storyline, [[Nick Fury]] whispers an, at the time, unrevealed secret to Thor that causes him to lose the ability to wield Mjolnir.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=Aaron, Jason|artist=Deodato|colorist= |letterer= |editor= |title=[[Original Sin (comics)|Original Sin]]|issue= #7|date=August 2014}}</ref> Soon afterwards, an unidentified woman picks up the hammer, taking possession of Thor's power as the new Goddess of Thunder, and fights [[Malekith the Accursed]], Dario Agger (the new [[Minotaur (comics)|Minotaur]]), and the [[Absorbing Man]]. Although Thor initially attempts to reclaim the hammer,<ref>''Thor'' vol.4 #4. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> he – referring to himself as 'Odinson' – relinquishes the name and role of Thor after witnessing her wield its power.<ref name="Thor vol. 4, #5">''Thor'' vol. 4 #5. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> Odinson suspects Foster as a possible candidate for his successor,<ref name="Thor vol. 4, #5"/> but he soon dismisses her due to her weakened condition from chemotherapy.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 4 #6. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

Angered that someone else is wielding Mjolnir, Odin and his brother [[Serpent (comics)|Cul]], the God of Fear, send the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]] after the new Thor to retrieve the hammer, but Odinson and Freyja assemble an army of female superheroes to aid her.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 4 #7</ref> When the battle is over, Odinson asks Thor to reveal her face, but is interrupted by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent Roz Solomon, Odinson's last 'viable' suspect as the new Thor after all other possible candidates came to assist in the battle. Unbeknownst to Odinson, Mjolnir has given Jane the strength to fight as Thor while it is in her possession.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 4 #8</ref> However, Jane's use of Mjolnir has perpetuated her cancer as a result of the transformation process purging all toxins from her body, including the [[chemotherapy]] being used for her treatment, each time she transforms.<ref>''The Mighty Thor'' vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

===Secret Wars===
During the 2015 "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline, Foster was a participant in the final battle between [[Earth-616]] and [[Ultimate Marvel|Earth-1610]] during its collision during the incursion event. She is one of the few survivors of the end of the extant Marvel Universe, boarding [[Reed Richards]]'s "life raft".<ref>''Secret Wars'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> She and the other survivors are awakened eight years later, having been trapped in suspended animation.<ref>''Secret Wars'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> In the interim, [[Doctor Doom]] created a new universe, [[Battleworld]], from the fragments of dead universes. Knowing the survivors represent the only hope of defeating Doom, [[Doctor Strange]] scatters Foster and the others to different parts of Battleworld. For this, Doom kills Strange and begins hunting the survivors.<ref>''Secret Wars'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> Foster infiltrated the Thor Corps, Doom's police force, and convinced a majority of them to revolt against Doom.<ref>''Secret Wars'' #7</ref>

===All-New All-Different Marvel===
In the 2015–18 [[All-New All-Different Marvel]] branding, Foster remains in Asgardia as a representative of Midgard (Earth) in the Congress of Worlds, and as Thor, she remains a fugitive pursued by Cul. Odinson is considered missing. She became involved in the war between [[Svartalfheim]], the realm of the Dark Elves, and [[Alfheim]], the realm of the Light Elves and encountered several incarnations of [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]]. After the elf races struck a deal by wedding their respective monarchs, Thor returned to Asgard to confront the power-mad Odin, who had Freyja on trial. Loki and Thor arrived at the point when The All-Mother was about to be placed on a verdict by Odin. The rebellious Asgardian warriors also made their way into the hall fighting Cul Borson's thunderguard. Thor and Odin got into a crunching battle that wandered across Saturn's moons while it was revealed that Loki was a spy for Freyja. Loki then stabs Freyja halting the battles at hand. Meanwhile, in a different location entirely, Odinson is held captive telepathically feeling the death of his mother.<ref>''The Mighty Thor'' vol. 5 #1-5</ref> Later, after returning to Earth, Jane is taken into custody by two S.H.I.E.L.D. agents who suspected of her double life as Thor until she's bailed out by Agent Solomon. She goes to [[Switzerland]] where she meets Agent Solomon and accompanies her to the Southern Ocean to find a hidden station that belongs to Roxxon. They find the station underwater where Thor encounters Shingen Harada, the second [[Silver Samurai]], who had invaded the station. After being defeated, Shingen escapes from the station, leaving Thor and Agent Solomon to drown. Thor manages to lift the station to the surface while Solomon interrogated the employees about the location of Dario Agger and his contingency plan known as the Agger Imperative. Upon entering Roxxon Corporation HQ, Thor battles the Mindless Ones and the B.E.R.S.E.R.K.E.R.S., a group of Hulk-like superhumans, while Solomon looked for Dario. During the fight, Thor is approached by S.H.I.E.L.D. who order her to surrender, apparently discovering her civilian identity. Upon holding off the S.H.I.E.L.D. squad, Thor finds Solomon wounded from her fight with Exterminatrix and attacks her and Minotaur with her lightning. When Exterminatrix was about to shoot at Dario with a golden bullet, Thor caught it in mid-air, only for her to get affected by the bullet's gold turning effect. When S.H.I.E.L.D. was about to arrest them, a portal appeared revealing Jane Foster coming to help Thor. While Jane removes the gold bullet from Thor, the Agger Imperative is activated causing the island where the building is to fall from the sky. While S.H.I.E.L.D. evacuates the building, Thor defeats Silver Samurai and Exterminatrix and destroys the island. While the villains are arrested, the two agents who tried to arrest Jane apologize to her and Thor. Thor then reveals to Solomon that the other Jane is an illusion created by Mjolnir and her secret identity as well. After promising to keep the secret safe, Solomon asks Jane about the hammer until Jane disappears when she grabs Mjolnir and gets struck by lightning.<ref>''The Mighty Thor'' vol. 5 #8-11</ref>

===All-New All-Different Avengers===
Thor is also once again a member of the Avengers and appears in ''All-New All-Different Avengers''. She appeared by chance in their encounter with Warbringer and subsequently agrees to help form a new official Avengers group.<ref>''All-New All-Different Avengers'' #1-3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Her identity is unknown to her teammates until she is separated from the hammer when she is transferred a few days into the future by [[Kang the Conqueror]], and [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]], the new Captain America, witnesses her as she reverts to Jane.<ref>''All-New, All-Different Avengers'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> He agrees to keep it secret, and offers her moral support during chemotherapy treatments.<ref>''All-New, All-Different Avengers'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

While treating mystical tumors in his former patients created by Misery, a manifestation of his own darkness, [[Doctor Strange]] calls on Thor for assistance; fully aware of her true identity as Jane Foster, Strange guides Thor in performing the necessary operations to remove the tumors from his patients after they had defeated the manifestation of Misery itself.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol.4 #18. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

Eventually, Jane's cancer reaches a point where she must confess her identity to Odinson and others, who force her to stay in a hospital under observation by Doctor Strange despite the threat of [[Mangog]] attacking Asgard, as Strange determines that one more transformation into Thor will kill Jane as the cancer spreads too far.<ref>''Thor'' #703. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> When Mangog proves too powerful, Jane transforms into Thor and confronts him,<ref>''Thor'' #704 (April 2018). Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> sacrificing Mjolnir – and thus her life – by binding Mangog and Mjolnir together with Gleipnir, the chain used to trap Fenris the wolf, and hurling both into the Sun. Knowing that she will die once the enchantment that turns her into Thor wears off, Jane kisses Odinson for a final time before expiring.<ref>''Thor'' #705 (May 2018). Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> Consumed by grief of Jane's loss, Odinson works to revive her as she hesitates at the gates of Valhalla. Upon Jane gaining his respect, Odin channels the powers of the God Tempest and assists Odinson into resurrecting Jane. In the aftermath of Mangog's defeat, Mjolnir is destroyed, but it is discovered after Foster hands Odinson an uru shard that he is now capable of wielding the metal again. Jane convinces Odinson to reclaim his name and continue in the War Between the Realms as the true Thor while she resolves to focus on her chemotherapy.<ref>''Thor'' #706 (June 2018). Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

===Becoming a Valkyrie===
When the "[[War of the Realms]]" comes to Earth, Jane assists in getting refugees to safety, with her chemotherapy successfully concluded and her hair now growing back. During the invasion she meets [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]] and Frigga, confirming that she was the Thor who defeated Mangog. When a new assault requires Odin and Frigga to retreat to Asgard with various Earth heroes, Frigga appoints Jane to act as All-Mother while she and Odin help to prepare the counter-attack to protect Earth. As the war continues, Brunnhilde and the rest of the [[Valkyrior]] are massacred by Malekith and his forces.<ref name="War of the Realms" /><ref>''War of the Realms'' #2. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> Jane Foster later takes the broken hammer of the [[Ultimate Thor|Earth-1610 Thor]] in order to help fight Malekith's forces.<ref>''War of the Realms'' #5. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> Acting as a Thor one last time, she joins Thor Odinson, young Thor, and future King Thor to rescue Odin and Frigga from Malekith. Jane Foster notices that the Earth-1610 Mjolnir is about to shatter from the battle, and she hurls it one last time at Laufey. Jane Foster bids farewell to the Earth-1610 Mjolnir as it returns to her, crumbling; however, its shards combine and merge into a golden bracelet that forms on her arm.<ref>''War of the Realms'' #6. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> Jane learns that this bracelet can now be anything that she needs. As she sees the sorrow in Thor mourning the Valkrior and his faith in Valhalla, Jane knows she needs to become a Valkyrie. Jane becomes the first in a new generation of Valkyries, armed with Undrajarn the All-Weapon, named so by the spirit of Brunnhilde as she and the Valkrior spirits rise from their bodies to find Valhalla.<ref name="New Valkyrie" /><ref>''War of the Realms Omega'' #1. Marvel Comics, 2019.</ref> On her first major outing as the Valkyrie, Jane loses Dragonfang in a battle with the Fast Five when the sword is stolen by [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]]. After Bullseye fatally wounds [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]],<ref>''Valkyrie: Jane Foster'' #1</ref> Jane accepts the need to move on from the past, sacrificing Dragonfang to defeat the assassin and then agreeing to take Heimdall somewhere other than Valhalla to give him a genuinely new experience.<ref>''Valkyrie: Jane Foster'' #2</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
===Thor===
When wielding Mjolnir, Foster gains all the powers of Thor, including the base Asgardian traits of superhuman strength, speed, stamina, and durability, as well as Thor's flight and control over lightning; though only a tiny portion of those powers.<ref>{{Cite web |author1=Pierce Lydon Contributions from George Marston |date=2022-06-30 |title=How Jane Foster became the Mighty Thor in Marvel comics |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/jane-foster-mighty-thor-love-and-thunder/ |access-date=2022-09-12 |website=gamesradar |language=en}}</ref>

Foster, however, demonstrates a form of control over Mjolnir that her predecessors lacked, such as changing its trajectory and velocity in mid-throw, and spinning it around her enemies to trap them, abilities neither Beta Ray Bill nor any of those aside from Jane had ever displayed.<ref name="Thor vol. 4, #5"/>

===Valkyrie===
As Valkyrie, Jane Foster wields Undrajarn the All-Weapon, a weapon that can change its shape into any weapon of her will.<ref name="New Valkyrie" /> These include a sword, an extendable mace, or even wings to fly. Jane Foster possesses various superhuman attributes due to her Asgardian physiology, grating her superhuman strength, speed, stamina, and durability, alongside new powers common among valkyries, such as mystical teleportation and death perception.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Cacciatore |first=Francesco |date=2022-06-07 |title=Jane Foster's Valkyrie Powers Make Her Thor Abilities Look Boring |url=https://screenrant.com/jane-foster-valkyrie-powers-thor-boring-marvel-comics/ |access-date=2022-09-12 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Donohoo |first=Timothy |date=2022-05-25 |title=Jane Foster's Powers, Enemies & Essential Stories |url=https://www.cbr.com/thor-jane-foster-valkyrie-powers-enemies-stories-marvel-comics/ |access-date=2022-09-12 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref>

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
Chase Magnett of ''[[Comicbook.com]]'' called Jane Foster a "key hero in The Avengers and for Asgard," writing, "She has recreated the story of Dr. Donald Blake from the original comics and updated it for the modern day. The morals have remained the same though, focused on how an ordinary human can be empowered by their own virtue and accomplish incredible tasks. Jane Foster did just that and inspired fictional Marvel heroes as well as very real readers along the way."<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Ranking Every Character to Wield Thor's Hammer |url=https://comicbook.com/comics/news/mjolnir-thor-ranking/ |access-date=2022-08-27 |website=Comics |language=en}}</ref> Thomas Bacon of ''[[Screen Rant]]'' described Jane Foster as "Marvel's best Thor to date," stating, "Right now, Jane Foster's death obscures the future of the Thor brand over in the comics. She has had a powerful impact, and has come to be loved by fans. [...] It's ironic; the death was always going to happen. But it was executed with so much style that it has had an impact Marvel could never have expected.

The effects of Jane’s chemotherapy are negated every time she transforms into Thor, and her human body is on the verge of death when the rest of the realms need her most. Jane’s journey as the god of thunder has been a highlight of superhero comics for the last few years, and this creative team made this heroine a major part of the Marvel’s line-up by consistently raising the stakes for both Jane and Thor."<ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-03-15 |title=Jane Foster makes the ultimate sacrifice in this Mighty Thor exclusive |url=https://www.avclub.com/jane-foster-makes-the-ultimate-sacrifice-in-a-mighty-th-1823812084 |access-date=2022-08-27 |website=The A.V.

Brian Truitt of ''[[USA Today]]'' asserted, "In ''Thor'' No. 8, out Wednesday and illustrated by Russell Dauterman, Dr. Jane Foster is revealed as the mysterious masked woman who has been swinging Mjolnir as Thor since the Dude Formerly Known as Thor — now just called the Odinson — was deemed unworthy. It's a big step in the evolution of the female character, according to ''Thor'' series writer Jason Aaron, but Jane's place as Marvel Comics' resident thunder goddess is just part of the current tale. [...] The response to the new female Thor, even when people didn't know who was under her mask, has been admittedly "overwhelming" for Aaron since she was announced on ABC's ''[[The View (talk show)|The View]]'' last July. But, he says he never thought it would be that big a deal in the first place."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Truitt |first=Brian |title=Female Thor's identity revealed in new issue |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2015/05/12/female-thor-identity-revealed/27199099/ |access-date=2022-08-27 |website=USA TODAY |language=en-US}}</ref> Rosie Knight of ''[[Nerdist]]'' asserted, "Thor has long been a staple of the House of Ideas. Though many have wielded the mystical hammer Mjolnir, it requires a lot to truly take on the mantle of Thor. In 2014’s Thor comic series, the “Goddess of Thunder” story arc by Jason Aaron, Russell Dauterman, and Matt Wilson introduced the world to an entirely new incarnation of the iconic character. Recasting Jane Foster as Thor was as stroke of genius, and brought a legion of new fans to the title."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Marvel's Jason Aaron and Russell Dauterman Talk the Road to THOR #700 (Exclusive) |url=https://nerdist.com/article/marvels-jason-aaron-and-russell-dauterman-talk-the-road-to-thor-700-exclusive/ |access-date=2022-08-27 |website=Nerdist |language=en-US}}</ref> Eric Nierstedt of ''[[ComicsVerse]]'' wrote, "Escapism or not, comics have shown us the horrible truth of how much sickness and disease can affect even the strongest person. THOR is the best example of this in comics right now. Since Jane Foster (who was fighting cancer) picked up Mjolnir, we as readers have been treated to the classic godly and otherworldly thrills that only THOR can provide. We’ve also seen a sickly, dying woman sitting in a chair, having poison pumped into her body to kill the poison that’s already there.

Medlen of ''[[The Mary Sue]]'' said, "Jane Foster is the one who Thor can’t ever seem to quit. Their relationship started back when Thor was also Dr. Blake. Foster was his nurse, but eventually became more than that. Through the years the two would be together and then break up, but they remained very close. To her credit, she also became much more than a love interest. She became a doctor in her own right before taking Thor’s title and hammer from him. It is understandable that Thor seems to always be in her orbit.

Jesse Schedeen of ''[[IGN]]'' gave ''Thor'' #1 a grade of 7.8 out of 10, asserting, "The new volume of Thor faces an uphill battle as it works to escape the shadow of God of Thunder. This first issue doesn't entirely replicate the sense of awesome grandeur of Aaron and Ribic's work and its three-pronged focus on Thor. It's different stylistically, but very much a continuation thematically. Hopefully as the series unfolds, Aaron and Dauterman mesh as storytellers, and we see more of the new female protagonist, this volume of Thor will grow to reach the heights of its predecessor."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Schedeen |first=Jesse |date=2014-09-29 |title=Thor #1 Review |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/29/thor-1-review |access-date=2022-09-12 |website=IGN |language=en}}</ref> Chase Magnett of ''[[Comicbook.com|ComicBook.com]]'' gave ''Thor'' #1 a grade of B+, writing, "The constant in this transition is Jason Aaron. His scripting is as compelling as ever. The first issue of ''Thor: God of Thunder'' ended with a very big moment and here he concludes the second issue with two, both of which should leave fans' jaws hanging. There is a hefty amount of exposition to be covered in the beginning of the issue, carrying over from both ''Original Sin'' and ''Thor: God of Thunder''. Aaron summarizes the big points with as much grace as possible and focuses on the story at hand. ''Thor'' #1 continues Aaron's central themes from the previous series, primarily focusing on the concept of worthiness. It is in the title of the issue itself: "If He Be Worthy". Throughout the early exposition, various figures ponder the fate of Mjolnir and question why no one is able to lift the hammer. These questions form the central conflict of the story. The monstrous antagonists of the first few pages are not nearly as great of a challenge to Thor as his inability to list Mjolnir is. Where Aaron and his collaborators go from here will prove interesting. They have crafted a conflict that has the potential to reflect upon gender politics, redemption, and self-worth. Thor has a long way to go in providing answers and a thesis for these ideas. Together, Dauterman, Wilson, and Aaron have crafted a first issue that ought to compel fans of Thor: God of Thunder to stick around and encourage others to try the new series. ''Thor'' #1 is a beautiful debut that contains all of the thunder and power of Marvel's mightiest hero."<ref>{{Cite web |title=ADVANCE REVIEW: Thor #1 - "All of the Thunder and Power of Marvel's Mightiest Hero" |url=https://comicbook.com/news/advance-review-thor-1-all-of-the-thunder-and-power-of-marvel-s/ |access-date=2022-09-12 |website=Comicbook.com |language=en}}</ref>

==== ''The Mighty Thor'' ====
According to [[Diamond Comic Distributors]], ''The Mighty Thor'' #1 was the 12th best selling comic book in November 2015.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Top 100 Comics: November 2015 |url=http://www.diamondcomics.com/Article/172235-Top-100-Comics-November-2015 |access-date=2022-09-12 |website=www.diamondcomics.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Top 300 Comics Actual--November 2015 |url=https://icv2.com/articles/markets/view/33277/top-300-comics-actual-november-2015 |access-date=2022-09-12 |website=icv2.com |language=en}}</ref>

Marykate Jasper of ''[[CBR.com]]'' called ''The Mighty Thor'' #1 a "fine first issue," writing, "Speaking of motive, the clever conceit of "The Mighty Thor" #1 -- that Jane must endanger her mortal body in order to assume her godly one -- also creates a very strong character moment that speaks to what makes this Thor unique. To Jane, her power as an individual, mortal doctor is obviously equal to that of a goddess of Thunder. Unfortunately, Aaron also utilizes the more regressive politics of traditional fantasy: democracy is impotent, words are nothing next to force and every character's evil or good intentions can be easily inferred from their world of origin. With so many wonderful, interesting shakeups in this issue, I'd have loved to see a little shift in worldview to go with it. Still, as a whole, "The Mighty Thor" #1 is a wonderful opener. I'm always happy to see Aaron on an Asgard book; he has a great sense of Thor's world and what makes it work, and Dauterman and Wilson's art shows that same understanding of what's so cool about the Ten Realms. "Mighty Thor" is off to an excellent start."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Jasper |first=Marykate |date=2015-11-17 |title=The Mighty Thor #1 |url=https://www.cbr.com/the-mighty-thor-1/ |access-date=2022-09-12 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> Jesse Schedeen of ''[[IGN]]'' gave ''The Mighty Thor'' #1 a grade of 9 out of 10, saying, "As with much of Aaron's work, there's a fair amount of humor to balance out the more dramatic elements. In this case the humor is of the darker variety, mostly centering around how terrible Roxxon and its master are. Roxxon is basically an indictment of greedy energy corporations, crooked politicians and vapid, fear-mongering newscasters all rolled into one. It adds a fun element of satire to the book that, again, helps keep things grounded ever so slightly amid all the spectacle and grandeur. Not that the book doesn't deliver plenty when it comes to spectacle and grandeur. Russell Dauterman proves once again why he's one of Marvel's best acquisitions in recent years. With his graceful line-work and sweeping, epic shots, it's easy to fool yourself into thinking that Olivier Coipel has started drawing Thor again. Dauterman brings his own brand of charm to the book, though. His style is perfectly suited to the dual nature of the book. He captures all the scope and majesty of Asgardia and its inhabitants, but his work is equally great at subtle emotion. The reader can't help but feel the intense pain and suffering Jane experiences as she undergoes her chemotherapy - it's written on every line and crease of her face. Dauterman has already grown significantly since his early Thor issues, so it'll be fun to see just how much his style continues to evolve as this new series gets underway. Thor is the last character that need sprucing up for the All-New, All-Different Marvel relaunch, so it's nice to see that Marvel didn't attempt to fix what wasn't broken. This issue offers an easy gateway into Aaron's ongoing saga, but it also dives right into the myriad conflicts that were left dangling prior to Secret Wars. Even in this first issue, this is a series that captures both the epic scope and intimate drama that make a good Thor comic."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Schedeen |first=Jesse |date=2015-11-16 |title=The Mighty Thor #1 Review |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/16/the-mighty-thor-1-review-2 |access-date=2022-09-12 |website=IGN |language=en}}</ref>

Karen O'brien of ''[[CBR.com]]'' described ''Valkyrie: Jane Foster'' #1 as "the culmination of writer Jason Aaron’s multi-year reimagination of the plucky doctor as a hero," asserting, "''Valkyrie: Jane Foster'' #1 is a worthy successor to Jane Foster’s tenure as the god of thunder. The inventive creative team has set into motion multiple complex conflicts that will test her new abilities and responsibilities both as a Valkyrie and as a doctor. While an enjoyable debut for longtime fans of Aaron’s work with the character, it’s also a great jumping-on point for new readers."<ref>{{Cite web |last=O'Brien |first=Karen |date=2019-07-26 |title=REVIEW: Valkyrie: Jane Foster #1 Proves Its Worthiness |url=https://www.cbr.com/review-valkyrie-jane-foster-1/ |access-date=2022-08-27 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> Kate Kosturski of ''[[WomenWriteAboutComics]]'' stated, "''Valkyrie: Jane Foster'' #1 presumes you read the ''War of the Realms'' event. You can certainly jump on with this series without having that knowledge, but reading (or re-reading) the event will provide a second layer of context to Jane’s existential struggle between her two worlds. I do wish this title had the touch of a female writer to lend a feminine perspective. But we do have Jason Aaron, a man who knows Jane Foster (The Mighty Thor) inside and out. Our Jane is in good hands."<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-08-15 |title=Heavy Is the Hand With the All-Weapon in Valkyrie: Jane Foster #1 |url=https://womenwriteaboutcomics.com/2019/08/all-weapon-valkryie-jane-foster-1/ |access-date=2022-08-27 |website=WWAC |language=en-US}}</ref> Cass Clarke of ''[[SlashFilm]]'' included the ''Valkyrie: Jane Foster'' comic book series in their "14 Best Marvel Comics That ''Love & Thunder'' Fans Will Want To Read" list, saying, "What works best about this new direction for Jane Foster is how the creative team seamlessly blends her medical knowledge with her cosmic duties. Whether or not she's serving as a Valkyrie, Jane always acts with compassion, providing the best care she can.

==== ''Jane Foster & The Mighty Thor'' ====
According to [[Diamond Comic Distributors]], ''Jane Foster & The Mighty Thor'' #1 was the 7th best selling comic book in June 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Comichron: June 2022 Comic Book Sales to Comics Shops |url=https://www.comichron.com/monthlycomicssales/2022/2022-06.html |access-date=2022-09-12 |website=www.comichron.com}}</ref>

Caitlin Chappell of ''[[CBR.com]]'' called ''Jane Foster & The Mighty Thor'' #1 a "promising future for fans of Valkyrie," writing, "For the most part, Sabino stylistically distinguishes the characters' inner monologues, but there are a couple of moments where the reader may wonder who's talking. However, when an Asgardian, or Jane, in one of her heroic personas, talks, Sabino makes a subtle but appreciated font change to make it look more ancient, helping to give credence to the almost Shakespearean way many of the Asgardians speak. It's a clever way to establish an accent without spelling things out phonetically or distracting from the proceedings. This exposition-heavy issue doesn't give either of the Thors many opportunities to leap into action, but that will likely change in Issue #2, as a team-up between Jane and Thor seems to be on the horizon. It will also be exciting to see more of Dowling's art in action, as the close-up facial expressions of characters are realistic yet soft, giving many characters a regal feel to them. On top of that, Aburtov's colors play with lightning and shadow to give these characters a glow about them, especially toward the second half of the issue. Overall, readers will have to wait for the meat of ''Jane Foster & The Mighty Thor,'' but if they can get through the dense exposition in this first issue, they're sure to enjoy the epic team-up that's on its way."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Chappell |first=Caitlin |date=2022-06-06 |title=REVIEW: Marvel's Jane Foster & The Mighty Thor #1 |url=https://www.cbr.com/marvel-jane-foster-mighty-thor-1-comic-review/ |access-date=2022-08-27 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> Jim Dandeneau of ''[[Den of Geek]]'' included the ''Jane Foster & The Mighty Thor'' comic book series in their "Best Thor Comics to Grab For Love & Thunder" list.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Dandy |first=Jim |date=2022-07-01 |title=The Best Thor Comics to Grab For Love & Thunder |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/comics/thor-comics-love-and-thunder/ |access-date=2022-08-27 |website=Den of Geek |language=en-US}}</ref> Cass Clarke of ''[[SlashFilm]]'' included the ''Jane Foster & The Mighty Thor'' comic book series in their "14 Best Marvel Comics That ''Love & Thunder'' Fans Will Want To Read" list.<ref name=":3" />

The Thors' subsequent investigation- including analysing samples taken from a Jane who died of cancer a few months before the other murders- confirm that the victims are all Janes, but they are unable to track down any living version of her, apart from learning that 'Thor the Unworthy' - the Earth-616 Thor who lost possession of Mjolnir - is interfering in attempts to find her.<ref>''Secret Wars: Thors'' #2.

The Thors are subsequently rallied to oppose Doom by the Jane Foster of Earth-616 - currently Thor and one of the few survivors of the Incursions - while Rune Thor is rendered unworthy as Jane forces him to acknowledge the truth about his actions.<ref>''Secret Wars: Thors'' #4.

===''Thor: The Mighty Avenger''===
In this all-ages "non-[[Comics vocabulary#Continuity|continuity]]" comic published in 2010 and 2011, Jane Foster is the newly promoted head of the department of Nordic Antiquities at the Bergen War Memorial Museum in Bergen, Oklahoma. She first encounters Thor when he attempts to smash one of the museum's exhibit cases (which is later revealed to contain an urn inside which Thor's hammer is concealed). Over the course of the title's eight issues Jane and Thor (who has been exiled from Asgard by Odin and is staying at Jane's apartment) become romantically involved and have a variety of adventures together.{{issue|date=February 2016}}

===Ultimate Marvel===
Jane briefly appears in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] imprint during the first series of [[Ultimates]], where she was a member of an anarchist cult who believed [[Ultimate Thor|Thorlief Golmen]] was the genuine god of thunder. She was also described as a nurse from [[San Francisco]].<ref>''Ultimates 2'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> In later events, it seems she and Thor live in a flat together.<ref>''Avengers vs. New Ultimates'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''What If?''===
In ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' #10 (Aug. 1978) titled "What If Jane Foster Had Found the Hammer of Thor", Jane assumes Donald Blake's place in finding Mjolnir and is imbued with Thor's powers. Calling herself '''Thordis''', she used her powers to rescue Donald Blake from danger. Upon saving Asgard from Ragnarok, Odin forces her to relinquish the hammer to Donald Blake so he can become the new Thor. This resulted in Jane losing her powers, but she was allowed to remain on Asgard and keep her goddess status since she later falls in love with and marries Thor.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jim |last=Beard |url=http://marvel.com/news/moviestories.14098.essential_thor~colon~_jane_foster |title=Essential Thor: Jane Foster |date=September 23, 2010 |publisher=Marvel.com |access-date=September 30, 2010 }}</ref>

In ''What If?'' #25 (Feb. 1980), titled "What If Thor Fought Odin over Jane Foster" (also known as "What If Thor Fought the Asgardian Gods"), Thor is banished from Asgard along with Jane when Thor refused to accept Odin's judgment following Jane's failure to ascend to godhood. Thor subsequently leads the Avengers against the forces of Asgard, leaving [[Iron Man]] and Loki (who once again attempted to seize rulership of Asgard during the conflict) dead and forcing Thor himself into self-imposed banishment for almost destroying Asgard in his selfishness.<ref>''What If?'' #25 (Feb. 1980)</ref>

===King Thor===
In [[Alternative versions of Thor (Marvel Comics)#King Thor|King Thor]]'s future timeline, Thor with the help of his three granddaughters recreated the Human race with the two first human beings named Steve and Jane. Unlike the ancient humans, they possessed longevity. However, when the time had come for Jane, King Thor offered Jane eternal life, but she refused, because she wanted to be reunited with her love, Steve, in the afterlife.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 4 Annual #1.

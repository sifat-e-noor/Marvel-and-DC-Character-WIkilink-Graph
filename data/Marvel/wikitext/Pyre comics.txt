'''''Venom''''' is the title of several American comic book series published by [[Marvel Comics]] focusing on the various heroic and villainous incarnations of the character [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]], which have usually consisted of a human host and amorphous alien being called a [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]]. The first incarnation of the character was the one created by the third and current human host to the symbiote (the first two being [[Spider-Man]] and [[Kree|Tel-Kar]]), [[Eddie Brock]], and—since 2011—its fifth host, [[Flash Thompson]]. Beginning with ''[[Venom: Lethal Protector]]'', eighteen [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] following Brock's adventures were published monthly between February 1993 and January 1998. A monthly ''Venom'' series began publication in 2003, following a new character, Patricia Robertson, and a clone of the original symbiote. The series concluded in 2004 after 18 issues. In 2011 another monthly series, following the adventures of Flash Thompson, was launched. The series resumed with vol. 3, vol. 4, and vol. 5 from 2016 to present.

==Publication history==
The first run of ''Venom'' titles consisted of eighteen [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] published consecutively, [[cover date]]d from February 1993 to January 1998. This limited-series run consisted of 60 issues altogether,<ref name="MiscStories1"/> effectively acting as an ongoing monthly series whose issue numbering reset with each story arc. The first limited series, ''[[Venom: Lethal Protector]]'', was written by Venom co-creator [[David Michelinie]] and began the character's transition from unambiguous villain to anti-hero; the story also introduced the symbiote offspring ([[Scream (comics)|Scream]], [[Phage (comics)|Phage]], [[Riot (comics)|Riot]], [[Lasher (comics)|Lasher]] and [[Agony (comics)|Agony]]),<ref name="LP1"/> who would recur in Marvel comics until the 2011 ''[[Carnage, U.S.A.]]'' limited series. Subsequent limited series included 1994's ''[[Venom: Separation Anxiety]]'', which continued the story of Venom's offspring and spawned the 1995 "[[Planet of the Symbiotes]]" cross-series story arc; 1996's ''Venom: Along Came a Spider'', which introduced symbiote anti-hero [[Hybrid (Scott Washington)|Hybrid]]; and 1997's ''Venom: On Trial'', which saw Eddie Brock tried for his crimes as Venom. Also published during this time was the [[prequel]] [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] comic ''Venom: Seed of Darkness'' #-1 (cover dated July 1997), following a pre-Venom Eddie Brock. [[Larry Hama]] wrote the most individual series with eight in total, including the 1997 final instalment ''Venom: The Finale'' which saw the symbiote apparently killed.<ref name="MiscStories1"/> According to editor [[Tom Brevoort]], the series was cancelled because "The return on the book had declined to the point where any immediate financial reward was overshadowed by [then editor-in-chief [[Bob Harras]]{{'}}s] discomfort with the character starring in his own title."<ref>{{cite news | last = Shutt | first= Craig | date = August 1997 | title = Villain Turned Hero: Venom | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | issue = 72 | page = 37}}</ref>

A new ongoing ''Venom'' series began in June 2003, written by [[Daniel Way]]. This series followed a new character, Patricia Robertson, and a clone of the Venom symbiote. Eighteen issues were produced by Way through November 2004, comprising the story arcs "Shiver" (#1-5), "Run" (#6-10), "Patterns" (#11-13), and "Twist" (#14-18).

In 2011, an ongoing ''Venom'' series began under writer [[Rick Remender]] with Spider-Man supporting character [[Flash Thompson]] in a leading role. The character regained the use of his legs while using the symbiote following their loss during his service in the [[Iraq War]] (as shown in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #574). The first issue introduced new versions of the villains [[Crime Master#Bennett Brant|Crime Master]] and [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)#Crime Master.27s Jack O.27Lantern|Jack O'Lantern]], who became recurring antagonists for Thompson. Issue #18 featured the return of Brock, who killed Hybrid and Scream in his crusade against the symbiotes and eventually bonded to the Toxin symbiote. The series was born after Thompson was first unveiled as the new Venom by writer [[Dan Slott]] in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #654. Remender was unsure how to develop the  Thompson narrative until he realized that he was a tragic hero: a violent man, haunted by a drinking problem and physical abuse suffered at the hands of his father.<ref name="RemenderLeaves"/>

Slott suggested that the new Crime Master's secret identity would be Bennett Brant, the thought-dead brother of Thompson's then-girlfriend Betty. Remender and his co-writer Cullen Bunn developed the new character, with Bunn developing the idea of multiple Crime Masters existing throughout history. Thompson found an arch-rival in the new Jack O'Lantern, developed by Remender and artist Tony Moore. Remender decided that making him a parallel of Thompson would create a stronger nemesis; therefore, Jack was also given a traumatic childhood in which he was exploited by Crime Master. ''Venom'' #13 saw the first mini-event of the series: a crossover with the [[Red Hulk]], [[X-23]] and the new  [[Ghost Rider]]. The event was initially conceived as a reunion of [[List of Fantastic Four members#New Fantastic Four|New Fantastic Four]] members [[Hulk]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], Ghost Rider and Spider-Man as part of a ''Venom''-''Wolverine'' crossover. As the idea developed with writer [[Jason Aaron]], it was decided to incorporate those characters' legacy characters into the Red Hulk, X-23, the new female Ghost Rider and Thompson's Venom. Following the event, Thompson joined another Remender-written book (''[[Secret Avengers]]'').<ref name="RemenderLeaves"/>

Remender stopped writing ''Venom'' in August 2012 (after issue #22) to work on ''[[Captain America]]'' and the launch of ''[[Uncanny Avengers]]''. He was replaced by Cullen Bunn, who had periodically worked as co-writer during Remender's term. The Venom character remained a member of the Secret Avengers, a series still written by Remender.<ref name="RemenderLeaves"/> In September 2012, Bunn said that Thompson would be moved from New York to Philadelphia from ''Venom'' #28. This relocation would allow the introduction of a new love interest, the superhero [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)#Valkyrie .28Brunnhilde.29|Valkyrie]]. Editor Tom Brennan explained, "His superhero career almost cost him everything...this is a good man with a troubled past who needed a fresh start...to take his next steps in becoming the hero he was born to be."<ref name="2012SepBunn"/> Marvel editor Stephen Wacker said the location change reflected Marvel's desire to expand the Marvel universe beyond New York City.<ref name="2012OctWacker"/> Bunn's run introduced the new character Mania, one of Thompson's students who is empowered by part of the Venom symbiote. In August 2013, Marvel announced that ''Venom'' would end with issue #42 in October 2013. Bunn was informed of the decision while writing ''Venom'' #31-#38, which he stated gave him time to bring some plot threads to a conclusion, but having originally outlined thirty issues worth of stories, there would be some ideas left to be told.<ref name="Venom2011End"/><ref name="Venom2011End2"/>

As part of the [[All-New, All-Different Marvel]] line-wide relaunch, a new ongoing title ''Venom: Space Knight'' was launched with writer Robbie Thompson and artist [[Ariel Olivetti]]. The series ran for 13 issues, cover-dated January 2016 to December 2016.

''Venom: Space Knight'' was immediately followed by a new ongoing ''Venom'' series (beginning January 2017) written by Mike Costa, starring new Venom host Lee Price. After six issues, the series was re-numbered to #150 and Eddie Brock was brought back as Venom's host. During Costa's run on the ongoing ''Venom'' title, two Venom-centric comic events were published, both centred around five-issue weekly series written by Cullen Bunn: ''Venomverse'' (November to December 2017) and ''Venomized'' (June 2018). Costa's run ended with issue #165, after which he wrote the five-issue limited series ''Venom: First Host'' (October to November 2018).

As part of the [[Fresh Start (comics)|Fresh Start]] line-wide relaunch, a new volume of ''Venom'' was launched (cover-dated July 2018, published May 9) written by Donny Cates. Event miniseries during this time included ''Absolute Carnage'' in 2019 and ''King in Black'' in 2020–21, both also by Cates. This volume concluded in 2021 with the end of Cates's run.

The fifth and current ongoing volume of ''Venom'' is written by Al Ewing and Ram V, with art by Bryan Hitch. The first issue, cover-dated January 2022, went on sale November 10th 2021. It stars Dylan Brock, son of Eddie Brock, as Venom's latest host.

After a fight with Spider-Man and an injection of [[dopamine]] blockers by Agent Smith, Brock is separated from the symbiote (which is apparently killed when Brock is re-arrested).{{sfn|Hama|November 1997}} The final issue sees Brock recover some memory of his history with Spider-Man; he had lost his knowledge of the hero's secret identity in the ''Spider-Man/Venom'' single issue (December 1997).{{sfn|Hama|November 1997|loc=Issue 2|p=17}}{{sfn|Hama|November 1997|loc=Issue 3|pp=13-15}}

An eighteen-issue monthly series, published under the [[Tsunami (Marvel Comics)|Tsunami]] imprint between June 2003 and November 2004, follows U.S. Army communications specialist Patricia Robertson. During a supply run to an outpost owned by the Ararat Corporation, she discovers that all the scientists except one have been killed. The Ararat Corporation is run by an alien colony of miniature spider robots (led by an entity named Bob) that have infiltrated the U.S. government. The Ararat Corporation has cloned Venom to facilitate the extermination of humanity; however, the clone ravages its hosts and kills the outpost crew.{{sfn|Way|2003|}}

Robertson finds an ally in the Suit, a mysterious individual made of the same miniature robots as Bob (which were accidentally brought to earth by [[Reed Richards]]). The Suit modifies Robertson while she is unconscious, allowing her to control the clone if it bonds with her. The Suit sabotages Wolverine (the clone's preferred host), forcing it to bond with Robertson. One of Bob's agents convinces Robertson to kill the real Venom to save humanity, and she frees the incarcerated Venom. She and Venom fight, but Venom escapes. Bob remotely deactivates the technology allowing Robertson to control the clone, forcing her to rely on willpower to maintain control. Robertson and Venom again fight, and Venom absorbs the clone. Venom decides to carry out the mission given to the clone by the Ararat Corporation.{{sfn|Way|2003|}}<ref name="MiscStories1"/>

Published by Marvel Comics since 2011, the series follows Spider-Man supporting character [[Flash Thompson]] (who debuted as the latest Venom, an agent of the United States military bonded with the symbiote, in the February 2011 ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #654).{{sfn|Slott|February 2011|}} Recurring enemies [[Crime Master]] and [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]] are introduced in ''Venom'' #1 and learn Thompson's secret identity in ''Venom'' #2, enabling them to threaten his loved ones in exchange for his cooperation.{{sfn|Remender|May 2011|pp=6-7}}{{sfn|Remender|June 2011|pp=22}} After Jack is disfigured by a grenade placed in his mask by Thompson, he considers himself Thompson's nemesis.{{sfn|Remender|May 2011|p=20}}{{sfn|Remender|August 2011|p=17}} The series' tie-in with the 2011 "[[Spider-Island]]" covered the death of Thompson's abusive father, Thompson facing the symbiote's former host Eddie Brock (Anti-Venom), the symbiote choosing Thompson over Brock{{sfn|Spider-Island|2011|loc=Issue 7|pp=13-19,22}} and Thompson helping [[Captain America]] and Spider-Man defeat The Queen.{{sfn|Spider-Island|2011}} The 2012 six-part story "Circle of Four" saw Thompson end his long-term relationship with [[Betty Brant]] for her safety; Venom joined the [[Red Hulk]], [[Ghost Rider]] and [[X-23]] to defeat [[Blackheart]] and the forces of hell (which are encroaching on earth).<ref name="RemenderLeaves"/> His performance results in Captain America recruiting him for the [[Secret Avengers]] in ''Secret Avengers'' #23 (April 2012) (also written by Remender).{{sfn|Remender|April 2012}} In ''Venom'' #15 (June 2012), Thompson had bonded with the symbiote to the point of lying for greater access to it.{{sfn|Remender|June 2012|pp=6-8}}

The 2012 story "The Savage Six" sees the return of a symbiote-less Eddie Brock, who is intent on exterminating all of the symbiotes (resulting in the deaths of Scream and Hybrid).{{sfn|Remender|June 2012|pp=3-5, 12-15}} Crime Master forms the [[Savage Six#Earth-616|Savage Six]]: a team including Jack O'Lantern, [[Death Adder (comics)|Death Adder]], [[Megatak]] and the [[Human Fly (comics)|Human Fly]].{{sfn|Remender|July 2012|pp=7-10}} Brock is involuntarily recruited onto the team after being possessed by the Toxin symbiote which Thompson stole for Crime Master in ''Venom'' #12.{{sfn|Remender|March 2012|pp=12-14,19,27}}{{sfn|Remender|July 2012|pp=19-21}} The Savage Six is sent after Thompson and his loved ones after he tries to murder Crime Master, resulting in Betty's learning Thompson's secret identity.{{sfn|Remender|July 2012 B}}{{sfn|Remender|August 2012}}{{sfn|Remender|September 2012}} Crime Master is ultimately unmasked as Betty's brother, Bennett Brant.

Following Remender's departure from the series, co-writer Cullen Bunn took over beginning with issue #23. Bunn's tenure began with the "Monsters of Evil" arc explaining a villainous turn by [[Daimon Hellstrom]] in Bunn's [[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself: The Fearless]],<ref name="2012SepBunnCBR"/> and continued a plot thread from Remender's "Circle of Four" arc which saw Venom, Hulk, X-23 and Ghost Rider unknowingly branded with [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]{{'}}s mystical symbol (marking them as Mephisto's potential heirs). The mark gives Venom control over demons; after a demon tries to possess him it becomes trapped in Thompson's body, unable to leave or control him. Venom must contend with Hellstrom, who is possessing monsters with demons (creating an army to help him become Mephisto's chosen heir).<ref name="2012SepBunnCBR"/>{{sfn|Bunn|November 2012|pp=15-17,19|loc=Issue 25}} ''Venom'' #23 (November 2012) introduced a new supporting character in journalist Kate Kiernan.{{sfn|Bunn|November 2012|pp=5-6|loc=Issue 23}} The 2012 story "[[Minimum Carnage]]" saw the series cross with ''[[Scarlet Spider (comic book)|Scarlet Spider]]'' to feature Venom and [[Kaine Parker#Scarlet Spider|Scarlet Spider]] against an escaped Carnage in the [[Microverse]].{{sfn|Bunn|December 2012}} The story concludes with Carnage defeated and lobotomized by Scarlet Spider, leaving the Carnage symbiote in control of his body and Venom able to sense Carnage's presence.{{sfn|Yost|December 2012|pp=8,20,24}} The events of "Monsters of Evil", "Minimum Carnage" and his fear of the symbiote controlling him prompt Thompson to move to Philadelphia in ''Venom'' #27.1.<ref name="2012SepBunnCBR"/> Thompson is possessed by the demon inside him while he sleeps, and terrorizes people as Venom.{{sfn|Bunn|January 2013}}

In Philadelphia, Thompson gains employment as a high school gym coach,{{sfn|Bunn|March 2013 32|pp=8-11}} while as Venom he comes into conflict with the [[U-Foes]], who kidnap and experiment on victims with alien technology. When the U-Foes knock Venom, the demon takes control of his body and uses the alien technology to teleport the villains to their apparent death in space. Kiernan and Thompson's lover Valkyrie later return home, leaving Venom alone. Brock returns as Toxin in ''Venom'' #30,{{sfn|Bunn|March 2013|pp=20-21}} to pursue Thompson while he himself is hunting the result of one of the U-Foes experiments: an alien-lifeform infested human turned into a cannibal. Thompson and Brock's fight liberates the aliens who begin infecting and transforming other humans to target their new enemies: Venom and Toxin.{{sfn|Bunn|March 2013 32|pp=14-17}}{{sfn|Bunn|April 2013|pp=10,15,19-22}} Together, Thompson and Brock defeat the aliens, and afterwards Brock calls a truce with Thompson, promising that the Venom symbiote will inevitably take over Thompson, and that he will return to kill him when that happens.{{sfn|Bunn|May 2013|pp=11-20}} ''Venom'' #39 sees the return of Jack, and the introduction of the new symbiote character Mania—Thompson's teenage student Andi who bonds with a spawn of the Venom symbiote when Thompson uses it to protect her from Jack. Jack kills Mania's father, and is revealed to be merely a man who was brainwashed by some of Jack's technology into believing he is the real Jack. According to Bunn, when he envisioned a new symbiote character Andi was not intended to be the host, but as the series progressed his plans changed.{{sfn|Bunn|October 2013|pp=8-10}}<ref name="Venom2011Mania"/> It is revealed that Mania's symbiote is the cloned symbiote from Way's 2003 ''Venom'' series. The symbiote expelled the clone, and the demonic brand along with it, passing it to Mania. When a team led by [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] starts killing the brand bearers and taking the brands for themselves, Venom and Mania manage to fight them off with assistance from Mephisto. Mephisto then departs after telling Thompson that the deal he made in exchange for the brand was with the symbiote, not Thompson. The series ends with Thompson admitting that despite his issues with his father, he had always wanted to be a dad, and that he will now take responsibility for Benton.<ref name="Venom2011End2"/>{{sfn|Bunn|"Mania"|pp=7, 9, 19-21|loc=Issue 42}}<ref name="2013Venom42"/>

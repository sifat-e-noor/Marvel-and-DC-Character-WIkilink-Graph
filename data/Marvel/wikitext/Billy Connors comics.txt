'''William "Billy" Connors''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is usually depicted as a supporting character of [[Spider-Man]], and the son of [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]], also known as the Lizard. Much of his character's story deals with the trauma of his father's uncontrollable powers. Billy was later injected with Curt's Lizard Formula to cure him of a deadly virus, which also mutated him into an anthropomorphic lizard.

==Publication history==
The character was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]] and first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #6 (November 1963).

==Fictional character biography==
Billy was born in [[Florida]] to [[Lizard (comics)|Curt]] and [[Martha Connors]], the former of whom is a biologist. The family moved to [[New York City]] so that Curt could continue his research in limb regrowth. The result was that Curt transformed into the Lizard and chased Billy in an attempt to eat him. Luckily, Billy was rescued by [[Spider-Man]] who turned his father back to normal with the antidote to the Lizard Formula.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #6</ref> 

During a major story arc, Martha and Billy were kidnapped by the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] branch led by [[Silvermane]] who wanted Curt to decipher an ancient tablet. Once again, Curt transformed into the Lizard and it took the combined effort Spider-Man and the [[Human Torch]] save Martha and Billy who were happily reunited with a cured Curt.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #74-77</ref>

At one point, Billy was kidnapped by the villain [[Stegron]] who demanded that Curt aid him in reviving a dinosaur army. Spider-Man and  Lizard fought Stegron and saved Billy from a terrible fate.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #165-166</ref>

Curt eventually chose to leave his family greatly saddening Billy and Martha.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #311-313</ref>

However, Curt came back and turned Billy into another lizard creature dubbed '''Lizard Jr.''', but the two were captured and turned back to normal by Spider-Man.<ref>''The Sensational Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #23-27</ref>

Sometime later, Curt mentions that Martha and Billy contracted cancer. Martha died while Billy survived, but was forced to live with his aunt.<ref>''Spider-Man: Quality of Life'' #4</ref>

During ''[[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt]]'' storyline, Lizard finally devoured Billy resulting in Lizard becoming a creature called the Shed.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #631</ref>

In a lead-up to the ''[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]'' storyline, Billy was revived by [[Ben Reilly|Miles Warren]], along with Martha, to motivate Curt to work for him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #4</ref> When New U Technologies suddenly breaks out in a melee, Billy and Martha are taken away by Curt, who claims that he can cure them of the [[Carrion (comics)|Carrion Virus]].<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #5</ref> Billy and Martha are injected with the Lizard Formula, which saves their lives, but also mutates them into anthropomorphic lizards.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy Omega'' #1</ref>

While Billy and his family have begun to live peacefully in the sewers, getting occasional friendly visits from Peter Parker and [[Mary Jane Watson]], he has started to openly talk of his longing to visit the outside world and attend a regular school; adding that kids with unusual appearances and abilities have begun going as well. Despite this, his father angrily rebuffs his pleas and he, in turn, has started to rebel.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #14-15</ref> He is later captured and used as a hostage by Kraven the Hunter as part of Kraven's efforts to test his cloned 'offspring' and provoke Spider-Man into becoming the 'hunter' Kraven feels his enemy should be. When trapped in a cage with Curt, Spider-Man learns that Curt took Billy to [[Doctor Strange]] after his resurrection, who confirmed that, for reasons he cannot understand, Billy is not 'just' a clone of the original one, but is actually Billy's soul reborn in his cloned body, driving Curt to be willing to take any measures necessary to protect his son.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #21</ref>

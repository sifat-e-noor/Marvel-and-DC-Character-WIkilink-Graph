'''Heliopolitans''' are a fictional group of gods, based on [[Ancient Egyptian deities]], appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Characters based on [[ancient Egyptian deities]] were first mentioned in ''Captain America Comics'' #20 (November 1942), published by [[Marvel Comics]]' predecessor [[Timely Comics]], in which [[Captain America]] and [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|Bucky]] investigate the murder of Colonel Fitzpatrick, who was studying the ''[[Book of Thoth]]'' while stationed in Egypt.<ref>''[[Captain America Comics]]'' #20 (November 1942). Marvel Comics.</ref> The Heliopolitans' first full [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] appearance was in the story "The Terror That Creeps" by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Werner Roth (comics)|Werner Roth]], published in ''[[Marvel Tales (1949–1957)|Marvel Tales]]'' #96 (June 1950), and involves a man that fails to convince the public that the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]] is slowly moving to the edge of the desert, where it will be empowered by [[Seth (Marvel Comics)|Set]] and destroy mankind.<ref>''[[Marvel Tales (1949–1957)|Marvel Tales]]'' #96 (June 1950). Marvel Comics.</ref> The goddess Bast would later make her first appearance (as a totem) with the [[Black Panther (character)|Black Panther]] in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #52 (July 1966), being called only Panther God, in ''Black Panther'' vol. 3 # 21 by [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Christopher Priest]] and Sal Velutto, it was revealed that the Panther God is [[Bast (Marvel Comics)|Bast]].<ref>{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/bast.htm|Panther God}}</ref><ref name="Encyclopedia_Mythologica"/><ref>''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #52 (July 1966). Marvel Comics.</ref> Many of the other deities, including Horus, Isis and [[Osiris (Marvel Comics)|Osiris]], were introduced in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' #239 (September 1975).<ref>''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' #239 (September 1975). Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Khonshu (Marvel Comics)|Khonshu]], who became associated with [[Moon Knight]], first appeared in ''Moon Knight'' #1 (November 1980).<ref>''[[Moon Knight]]'' #1 (November 1980). Marvel Comics.</ref> Joseph Muszynski argued in his book ''Everything I Needed to Know About Life I Learned from Marvel Comics'' that the introduction of Egyptian deities "excited our tendency to enjoy variety" as the pantheon contained multiple gods and personalities as opposed to the [[Judeo-Christian]] religions.<ref>{{cite book |last=Muszynski |first=Joseph |date=May 7, 2017 |title=Everything I Needed to Know About Life I Learned from Marvel Comics |publisher=Lulu |isbn=978-1365686740}}</ref> Ed Strauss contended that Marvel was able to dive into [[ancient Egyptian religion]] because it "had long been retired into the realm of mythology" unlike Christianity.<ref>{{cite book |last=Strauss |first=Ed |date=March 1, 2017 |title=The Superheroes Devotional: 60 Inspirational Readings |publisher=Shiloh Run Press |isbn=978-1634099639}}</ref>

==Fictional history==
The Heliopolitans were worshipped as deities by the inhabitants of the [[Nile|Nile River Valley]] from as early as 10,000 BC. According to Heliopolitan legend, the first of these were Gaea (as [[Neith]]), the Demiurge (as [[Nu (mythology)|Nun]]), and [[Set (comics)|Set]] (as [[Apep|Apep/Apophis]]). Neith and Nun sired [[Atum (comics)|Atum]], the first of the [[Ogdoad (Egyptian)|Ogdoad]] — the old gods. As Neith went about creating mortal life, Set desired to destroy her creations. In turn, Neith called Atum for protection. Atum and Set fought for eons until Atum transformed into the Demogorge and drove Set off. After Set's defeat, Atum begot the [[Ennead]] — the new gods, took the name Ra and settled in the sun.<ref name="Encyclopedia_Mythologica">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Anthony Flamini]], [[Greg Pak]], [[Fred Van Lente]] & [[Paul Cornell]] | Penciller =  Kevin Sharpe | Inker = Kevin Sharpe | Story =  | Title = Thor & Hercules: Encyclopaedia Mythologica| Issue = 1 | Date = July 2009| Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>

The Ennead resided in the ancient city of [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] until their king [[Osiris (Marvel Comics)|Osiris]] placed mortal [[pharaoh]]s in charge so that the gods could become less involved with human affairs and relocated themselves to the extradimensional realm of Celestial Heliopolis, known to the ancient Egyptians as "[[Aaru]]."<ref name="Encyclopedia_Mythologica" /> A few, including Bast, Sobek, [[Sekhmet (comics)|Sekhmet]], [[Thoth]], and Ptah choose to remain on Earth, integrating themselves into ''The Orisha'', the pantheon of [[Wakanda]].<ref name=":1">{{cite web|title=A Guide to the Myths, Legends, and Gods of Wakanda|url=https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/a-guide-to-the-myths-legends-and-gods-of-wakanda|access-date=2020-01-31|website=Marvel Entertainment|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{cite web|title=Black Panther's Sequel Could Bring a New Mythology Into the MCU|date=21 February 2018 |url=https://www.cbr.com/black-panther-sequel-new-gods-mcu/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180222225817/https://www.cbr.com/black-panther-sequel-new-gods-mcu/|archive-date=2018-02-22|access-date=2018-02-22}}</ref>
Bast would eventually become the patron deity of Wakanda, while Sobek and Sekhmet became patrons of lesser influential Wakandan cults.<ref name="Encyclopedia_Mythologica" />

In Celestial Heliopolis, Seth murdered his brother Osiris in an attempted coup but Osiris' wife [[Isis (Marvel Comics)|Isis]], and his sons Horus and Anubis combined their powers to resurrect Osiris. Osiris then dispatched Horus to exact revenge on Seth in a battle that lasted for several hundred years, ending when Seth gained the upper hand and sealed the gods in a pyramid.<ref name="Encyclopedia_Mythologica" /> The trapped gods remained in the pyramid for several millennia until they managed to reach out to the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] god [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]]. With help from Odin's son, [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], they defeated Seth, severing his left hand as they battled, and freed the Heliopolitans.<ref>''Thor'' #240-241 (October–November 1975). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Osiris later empowered Thor to revive Asgardians who were harmed by the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]].<ref>''Thor'' #301 (November 1980). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The gods of Heliopolis, powerless and calling themselves "Lost Ones", joined Thor and [[Earth Force (Marvel Comics)|Earth Force]] in fighting Seth and his forces again, and ultimately regained their powers after the apparent death of Seth.<ref>''Thor'' #397-400 (November 1988-February 1989).

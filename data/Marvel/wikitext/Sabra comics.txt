During the events of ''[[Secret Invasion]]'', Sabra is briefly seen fighting off Skrulls in Israel.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #6 (November 2008). Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the ''[[Ends of the Earth (Marvel Comics)|Ends of the Earth]]'' storyline, Sabra is one of the heroes that respond to Spider-Man's call for help against Doctor Octopus' satellite factories.

==Powers and abilities==
Sabra's [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] power has enhanced all of her body's physical abilities, such as strength, speed, agility, reflexes, endurance and stamina, to superhuman levels.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Shira Haas tapped to play Sabra |url=https://www.australianjewishnews.com/shira-haas-tapped-to-play-sabra/ |access-date=2022-09-16 |website=www.australianjewishnews.com |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Allan |first=Scoot |date=2021-05-16 |title=10 Strongest Female Marvel Protagonists |url=https://www.cbr.com/strongest-female-marvel-protagonists/ |access-date=2022-09-16 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Stahl |first=Shane |date=2022-10-02 |title=Who Is Marvel Comics' Sabra, the Controversial Addition to 'Captain America: New World Order?' |url=https://collider.com/who-is-sabra-marvel-captain-america-new-world-order/ |access-date=2022-10-16 |website=Collider |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=updated |first=Philip Sledge last |date=2022-07-31 |title=Captain America: New World Order: What We Know About The Marvel Movie So Far |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/superheroes/marvel-cinematic-universe/captain-america-new-world-order-what-we-know-about-the-marvel-movie-so-far |access-date=2022-10-17 |website=CINEMABLEND |language=en}}</ref> She can withstand impacts up to high caliber rifle fire, though she has been wounded by fire from an MP-40 sub-machine gun.

She is also able to charge other individuals by transferring to them her own life energy, and in the process, enhance their physical state of health (she has twice used this ability to save dying individuals) and granting them low-level super-powers, which are apparently at random and otherwise unrelated to Sabra's own mutant powers (such as the wind-generating powers given to a woman who took the costumed identity Windstorm).<ref>{{Cite web |last=Allan |first=Scoot |date=2022-08-07 |title=Marvel's 10 Most Powerful Healers |url=https://www.cbr.com/marvels-most-powerful-healers/ |access-date=2022-09-16 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Miller |first=Max |date=2022-09-12 |title=Who Is Shira Haas' Sabra In Captain America: New World Order? |url=https://www.looper.com/1004728/who-is-shira-haas-sabra-in-captain-america-new-world-order/ |access-date=2022-09-16 |website=Looper.com |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Rajput |first=Rohit |title=Who is Sabra?

The cape also contains a wafer-thin computer system which processes her mental commands received by the circuitry in her tiara. The cape also has an optical navigation device which functions as an auto-pilot. Besides her cape, Sabra also has neuronic-frequency stunners built into her two wrist bracelets that shoot "energy quills", small bundles of low-density plasma (like balled lightning), that travel just below the speed of sound and paralyze the nervous system of any organic being almost instantaneously.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Miller |first=Max |date=2022-09-12 |title=Who Is Shira Haas' Sabra In Captain America: New World Order? |url=https://www.looper.com/1004728/who-is-shira-haas-sabra-in-captain-america-new-world-order/ |access-date=2022-09-16 |website=Looper.com |language=en-US}}</ref>

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
Brenton Stewart of ''[[CBR.com]]'' referred to Sabra as "one of Marvel's most prominent international heroes," writing, "While she's never had her own series, she's carved out one of the most fascinating histories of any of Marvel's international heroes in her various encounters with the X-Men, the Hulk and Marvel's other heroes."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Stewart |first=Brenton |date=2020-06-24 |title=Sabra: Whatever Happened to Israel's Strongest Superhero? |url=https://www.cbr.com/sabra-whatever-happened-to-israels-strongest-superhero/ |access-date=2022-09-16 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> Nirit Anderman of ''[[Haaretz]]'' called Sabra the "first Israeli superheroine," saying, "Although there were several attempts to create local superheroes in Israel – for example Sabraman, Super Shlumper and Falafel Man – none of them managed to survive for long. The only ones who succeeded in this mission, even going one step further and creating a female superhero rather than a male one, were the guys from Marvel."<ref>{{Cite news |title=Marvel's Israeli Superheroine, Who Brought the Hulk Into the Conflict, Turns 40 |language=en |work=Haaretz |url=https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/2020-07-30/ty-article-magazine/.premium/not-just-a-mossad-agent-marvels-israeli-superheroine-sabra-turns-40/0000017f-e24d-d38f-a57f-e65f6c890000 |access-date=2022-09-16}}</ref>

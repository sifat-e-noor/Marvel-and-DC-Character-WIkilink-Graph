The '''Reavers''' are a [[fiction]]al [[team]] of criminal [[cyborg]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The most significant team of Reavers were dedicated to the destruction of the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[X-Men]], and a number of them especially wanted to take revenge on [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] in particular. The name Reavers was originally used by a gang of [[Australia]]n cyborgs. The name later referred to a group under the leadership of [[Donald Pierce]], consisting of the three survivors from the original Reavers along with other cyborgs.

The aforementioned Reavers are different from the Reavers of the planet Arcturus IV, who exist in the future of the alternate reality [[Earth-691]] and are involved in the histories of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] members [[Starhawk (comics)|Starhawk]] and [[Aleta Ogord|Aleta]].<ref>''Marvel Presents'' #9</ref>

The Reavers appeared in the 2017 film ''[[Logan (film)|Logan]]'' with their leader [[Donald Pierce]] portrayed by [[Boyd Holbrook]].

==Publication history==
The Reavers first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #229 and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Marc Silvestri]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=291}}</ref>

==Fictional group history==

===Looters===
The first group of cyborgs calling themselves the Reavers operated out of an underground complex beneath the [[ghost town]] of Cooterman's Creek in North Central Australia. The Reavers acted as a commando-style team of thieves, with apparently dozens of members. Their base was inexplicably equipped with advanced computers and a sub-basement and tunnel system. The Reavers coerced the mutant teleporter [[Gateway (comics)|Gateway]] to teleport them from Australia to locations around the world to conduct their robberies. Informed of the Reavers' existence by [[Roma (comics)|Roma]], the X-Men defeat the Reavers in battle and expel them from their base, which they then co-opt for their own use. The X-Men destroy some of the Reavers and force most of the rest to enter the mystical [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]] to meet unrevealed fates. Only [[Pretty Boy (comics)|Pretty Boy]], [[Skullbuster]], and [[Bonebreaker]] escape.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #229 (May 1988). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Donald Pierce's Reavers===
The Reavers are reassembled under the leadership of Donald Pierce, who reorganizes the team as an assassination squadron to undertake para-military style commando operations, dedicated to taking vengeance on the X-Men in particular and eliminating mutants in general. Pierce combines the three survivors of the original Reavers with [[Lady Deathstrike]] and the three former Hellfire Club mercenaries Cole, [[Angelo Macon|Macon]], and Reese.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #247-249. Marvel Comics.</ref> No explanation is given for why Pretty Boy, Skullbuster, and Bonebreaker came to be involved with the group, aside from Pierce claiming to have created the original Reavers.<ref name="UK251">''Uncanny X-Men'' #251 (November 1989). Marvel Comics.</ref> Lady Deathstrike's reasons for joining the Reavers are even more unclear, as she professes a lack of interest in their goal of eliminating mutants.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #249 (October 1989). Marvel Comics.</ref>

While the X-Men are away from their Australian base, the Reavers retake the ghost town and wait for the team to come back. However, on their return the X-Men escape the Reavers through the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]]. Only Wolverine, who is on a leave of absence in [[Madripoor]], remains. Once he returns, they capture him, and proceed to torture and [[crucify]] him.<ref name="UK251"/> Wolverine escapes the Reavers with the aid of [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]]. The Reavers then attack the [[Muir Island]] Mutant Research Center, theorizing that it is Wolverine's most likely destination. They fight [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]] and [[Moira MacTaggart]]'s alternate X-Men team, and kill [[Stonewall (comics)|Stonewall]] and [[Sunder (comics)|Sunder]]. During the assault on Muir Island, Skullbuster is rendered inoperative by sniper fire from [[Forge (comics)|Forge]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #252-255. Marvel Comics.</ref> Donald Pierce rescues a gravely wounded pilot named [[Skullbuster#Cylla Markham Skullbuster II|Cylla Markham]], who agrees to be converted into a cyborg.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #261. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Around this time, Bonebreaker, Reese, and Pretty Boy are dispatched to a New York warehouse after [[Microchip (comics)|Microchip]], an associate of the [[Punisher]], in a self-confessed mistake, infiltrates their computer system. The temporary absence of Gateway gives Punisher and Microchip enough time to evacuate and set up resistance. The warehouse is destroyed, but the two escape through the sewer.<ref>''Punisher'' (vol. 2) #33. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Reavers face off against the Punisher again. In the firefight, the Reavers kill Microchip's cousin. The Punisher sets off auto-destruct charges which cause heavy damage to the three Reavers, particularly Bonebreaker, whose cybernetic lower body is demolished. The Reavers retreat.<ref>''Punisher'' (vol. 2) #34. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Reavers then successfully attack the [[Emma Frost|White Queen]]'s company, Frost Technotics.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #262. Marvel Comics.</ref> They capture [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], who has returned from inside the Siege Perilous, although Rogue is then rescued by a recreation of [[Ms. Marvel]]. Donald Pierce transforms Cylla Markham into the new Skullbuster (although she usually goes by the name Cylla).<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #269. Marvel Comics.</ref> Lady Deathstrike later seeks Wolverine in Madripoor and Vancouver. Pierce creates an android named [[Elsie-Dee]] and a Wolverine android double named "[[Albert (comics)|Albert]]" to kill Wolverine. The attempt fails, however, when Elsie-Dee rebels against her programming.<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol. 2) #35-39. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Upstarts and humans===
As part of the [[Upstarts (comics)|Upstarts]]' game, [[Trevor Fitzroy]] dispatches his own [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] to the Reavers' Australian hideout to kill Pierce and anyone else they find there. In the ensuing battle, only Pierce, Lady Deathstrike and Cylla escape the massacre, Pierce seemingly only making it as far as the Hellfire Club before he is "killed".<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #281-282. Marvel Comics.</ref> Cylla later resurfaces, allying herself with [[Bloodscream]] in an attempt to murder Wolverine. However, Bloodscream betrays her and sucks the life from her, killing her.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #77-78. Marvel Comics.</ref>

However, most Reavers somehow survive their supposed deaths. They later return to battle the [[X-Treme X-Men]] on behalf of the [[Shadow King]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Chris Claremont]]|penciller=[[Salvador Larroca]]|story=Queen of Shadows|title=[[X-Treme X-Men]] 2001 Annual|issue=|date=2001|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

Donald Pierce puts together a new group of Reavers, composed of young anti-[[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] humans (with the exception of [[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]], who at the time was unaware that he was a mutant).<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 2 #5 (November 2003). Marvel Comics.</ref> They are defeated by [[Karma (comics)|Karma]], Elixir, and a handful of young mutants.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 2 #6 (December 2003)</ref> The group later breaks Pierce out of prison, but with Elixir as bait, they are lured into an ambush and captured by the same five mutants who stopped Pierce when he first betrayed the Hellfire Club's Inner Circle.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 2 #13 (August 2004). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Messiah Complex===
[[Image:The New Reavers.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The latest incarnation of the Reavers in Messiah Complex by [[Humberto Ramos]].]]
The Reavers return to play a role in the [[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]] event, under the leadership of Lady Deathstrike.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/articles/827/827571p7.html IGN: X-Men: Messiah Complex - Day Thirteen<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Judging from the design of their costumes, as well as their rhetoric in battle, these newest Reavers are simply existing members of the [[Purifiers (Marvel Comics)|Purifiers]] upgraded with cybernetics rather than classic members of the team.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Deployed as an elite commando unit designed to eliminate organized mutant resistance, the Reavers manage to track down and confront Cable in Alberta, Canada before being attacked by the new X-Force.<ref>''New X-Men'' #44-46. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the ensuing battle, Deathstrike and the Reavers are all terminated by Wolverine's strike team, but not before killing the mutant [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]] and injuring [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. To this date only Deathstrike's fate was revealed and it remains to be seen whether the Purifiers will be able to upgrade more of their fighters with Reaver technology to replace the ones lost in Canada.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #504. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Cable and X-Force===
The Reavers play a small role in ''[[Cable and X-Force]]'' - Volume 4. Pretty Boy, Bonebreaker, Skullbuster (female), and Skullbuster (male) are quickly dispatched by Hope Summers and Cable before being able to deploy an ICBM.{{issue|date=April 2016}}

===Hunt for Wolverine===
During the "[[Hunt for Wolverine]]" storyline, Donald Pierce later leads a new group of Reavers, composed of Star and Shine whom together go by the Starshine moniker, Pretty Boy, Skullbuster (Cylla Markham) and Bonebreaker. They were able to find the place where the X-Men had hidden Wolverine's metal-encased body until they were found by an X-Men. During the battle, Wolverine's adamantium shell was broken and to the Reavers surprise it was empty. The X-Men eventually defeated the Reavers and delivered them to Alpha Flight. Only Starshine was able to evade capture and contacted Lady Deathstrike about their findings.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Operating in Madripoor===
During the "Iron Man 2020" event, Donald Pierce and the Reavers are shown to have established a company called Reavers Universal Robotics in Hightown, [[Madripoor]]. Albert shows up there to confront Donald Pierce where he is confronted by Bonebreaker and the Reavers. Pierce arrives to prevent the lobby from being wrecked. Taking Albert on a tour, Pierce states that he has been upgrading his operations with the help of a 3D Printer. When Pierce stated that Elsie-Dee is not here and that she previously appeared asking to have her self-destruct mechanism disarmed, Albert retaliates while claiming that Pierce doesn't own him or Elsie Dee. After Albert subdues the Reavers, Pierce states that he sold Elsie-Dee's head to yakuza boss Kimura, the arms to the Jade Dragon Triad, and the legs to the Vladivostok Mafia. In light of Albert's actions towards them, the Reavers, Kimura, the Jade Dragon Triad, and the Vladivostok Mafia to take action against Albert vowing that he will never make it out of Madripoor alive.<ref>''2020 iWolverine'' #1.

Piledriver was created by [[Len Wein]] and [[Sal Buscema]], and he made his first appearance in ''[[The Defenders (comic book)|The Defenders]]'' #17 (November 1974).

==Fictional character biography==
'''Brian Philip Calusky''' was raised on a farm and eventually became a farmhand. As life on the farm is boring, he decides to commit crimes for excitement, which eventually land him in prison, where he meets and becomes cellmates with Dirk Garthwaite, also known as the [[Wrecker (comics)|Wrecker]].

Garthwaite, together with Calusky, two other inmates at Ryker's Island Prison, Dr. Eliot Franklin, and Henry Camp, successfully breaks out of jail and finds his crowbar. When lightning strikes the crowbar, Garthwaite magically distributes the enhanced strength of the Wrecker among the four of them. The Wrecker's three allies then adopt costumes and aliases as well: Franklin becomes [[Thunderball (comics)|Thunderball]], Camp becomes [[Bulldozer (comics)|Bulldozer]], and Calusky becomes Piledriver. As a result of his newfound powers, Calusky's hands become oversized in proportion to his body. Together, they become known as the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]]. They battle the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] while attempting to locate the gamma bomb, and Piledriver is defeated by [[Luke Cage|Power Man]] in this encounter.<ref>''Defenders'' #17-19</ref>

With the Wrecking Crew, Piledriver fights [[Captain America]] and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] while trying to lure [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] into battle,<ref>''Iron Fist'' #11-12</ref> who they later fight in a revenge attempt.<ref>''Thor'' #305</ref> They are among the various criminals taken to the [[Beyonder]]'s Battleworld. Piledriver faces off against the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], the [[Hulk]], the [[X-Men]], the [[Fantastic Four]], and other superheroes.<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes Secret Wars'' #1-12</ref> Piledriver steals computer discs from Dextron Labs and battles [[Spider-Man]] and [[Julia Carpenter|Spider-Woman II]].<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #125</ref> Along with the Wrecking Crew, Piledriver joins the [[Masters of Evil]], which attacks and takes over [[Avengers Mansion]]. Piledriver helps defeat the god [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] in combat but is drained of his superhuman powers by Thor.<ref>''Avengers'' #273-277</ref> He is freed from prison by the Wrecker, but without his superhuman powers he is defeated by Spider-Man and Spider-Woman.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #126</ref> He later regains his powers and escapes from the [[Vault (Marvel Comics)|Vault]].

Piledriver defeats Captain America and encounters [[Damage Control (comics)|Damage Control]] personnel.<ref>''Damage Control'' (vol. 2) #1</ref> With the rest of the Wrecking Crew, Piledriver frees the Wrecker and [[Ulik]] from police custody and battles Hercules and Thor.<ref>''Thor'' #418</ref> His powers are drained by [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]], but he escapes.<ref>''Thor'' #426-428</ref>

Piledriver has the demeanor of a "good ol' country boy". He has fought many of Marvel's superheroes over the years, including Spider-Man, the Avengers, the Defenders, and Thor. As part of the Wrecking Crew, he threatens the lives of the innocent Damage Control workers. Thunderball, who has a soft spot for the man in charge, John Porter, attacks Piledriver and the others via trickery, allowing them to escape.

Unlike Thunderball, Piledriver has remained loyal to the Wrecker and has only been separated from the Wrecking Crew through many incarcerations.

Piledriver discovers that he has a son named Ricky Calusky.<ref>''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]''</ref> The boy lives with his grandparents, but when he discovers who his father is, he runs away and joined the Wrecking Crew as the Excavator, gaining a mystically charged shovel. However, he and the rest of the Crew were defeated by the Runaways during a bank robbery.

The [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] has hired Piledriver as part of his criminal organization to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act. He helps them fight the New Avengers but is taken down by Dr. Strange.

As part of the Hood's gang, he later joins the fight against the invading Skrull force in New York.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #6</ref> He joins the Hood's gang in an attack on the New Avengers, who were expecting the [[Dark Avengers]] instead.<ref>''New Avengers'' #50</ref>

During the ''[[Avengers: Standoff!]]'' storyline, Piledriver is an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #7</ref>

During the "Search for Tony Stark" story arc, Piledriver and the Wrecking Crew rejoin the Hood's gang as they attack Castle Doom. Piledriver is defeated by Doctor Doom in his Iron Man armor.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' #597-598</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Due to Asgardian magic, Piledriver possesses superhuman strength and a high degree of imperviousness to harm. He can withstand high amounts of concussive force and is virtually bulletproof. Piledriver's power augments his entire body, strengthening his bone, muscle, and flesh. Because of this, he can withstand the impact of high-caliber bullets. Because of his strength and particular talent, he has oversized hands which are more powerful than the other members of the Wrecking Crew, except for the Wrecker. His superhuman abilities are four times greater than when he originally took some of the Wrecker's power, making him somewhat stronger than an average well-trained [[Asgardians (Marvel Universe)|Asgardian]] god.<ref>''Damage Control'' (vol. 2) #1</ref>

==Other versions==
===''House of M: Masters of Evil''===
Piledriver and the rest of the Wrecking Crew appear as members of the Hood's Masters of Evil.<ref>''House of M: Masters of Evil'' #1</ref> He ends up being absorbed into [[Scramble (comics)|Scramble]]'s body when the Masters of Evil arrive in the Central American country of Santo Rico.<ref>''House of M: Masters of Evil'' #2</ref>

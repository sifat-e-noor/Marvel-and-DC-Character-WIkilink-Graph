In [[Navy|navies]] and the maritime industry, '''damage control''' is the emergency control of situations that may cause the sinking of a [[watercraft]].

Examples are:

* rupture of a pipe or [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] especially below the waterline and
* damage from grounding (running aground) or hard berthing against a [[wharf]].
* temporary fixing of bomb or explosive damage.

==Measures used==
Simple measures may stop flooding, such as:

* locking off the damaged area from other ship's compartments;
* blocking the damaged area by wedging a box around a tear in the ship's hull,
* putting a band of thin sheet steel around a tear in a pipe, bound on by clamps.

More complicated measures may be needed if a repair must take the pressure of the ship moving through the water. For example:

* [[Thermal lance]] cutting around the rupture.
* [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting|Oxyacetylene welding]] or electric [[arc welding]] of plates over the rupture.
* Quick-drying [[cement]] is applied underwater over the rupture.

Damage control training is undertaken by most seafarers, but the engineering staff are most experienced in making lasting repairs.

Damage control is distinct from [[firefighting]]. Damage control methods of fighting fire are based on the class of ship and cater to ship specific equipment on board.

==Notable contemporary examples==

Particular examples:

* [[USS Samuel B. Roberts (FFG-58)|USS ''Samuel B. Roberts'']]: After an [[Iran]]ian [[naval mine|mine]] holed the [[frigate]] beneath the waterline in 1988, the crew fought fire and flooding that threatened to sink it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navybook.com/no-higher-honor/timeline/mine-strike/|title=Mine Strike!|date=5 February 2013}}</ref>
* [[USS Princeton (CG-59)|USS ''Princeton]]: After an Iraqi naval mine damaged the [[cruiser]] during the 1991 [[Gulf War]], her crew fought fires and sealed cracks in the hull, then repaired electronic systems, bringing the [[Aegis combat system]] back on line within 2 hours.
* [[USS Cole (DDG-67)|USS ''Cole'']]: immediate measures to stop sinking after the ship was [[USS Cole bombing|bombed in 2000]].
* [[HMS Nottingham (D91)|HMS ''Nottingham'']]: measures to keep the ship afloat after, on 7 July 2002, the ''Nottingham'' ran aground on the submerged but well-charted [[Wolf Rock, Lord Howe Island|Wolf Rock]] near [[Lord Howe Island]].

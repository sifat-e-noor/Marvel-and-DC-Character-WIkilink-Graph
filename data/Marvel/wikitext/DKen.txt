The '''Shi'ar''' ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|iː|ˈ|ɑr}} {{respell|SHEE|ar|'}}) are a [[List of fictional humanoid species in comics|fictional species]] of [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The Shi'ar Empire (or [[Imperium]]), is a vast collection of alien species, cultures, and worlds situated close to the [[Skrull]] and [[Kree]] Empires. The Shi'ar are one of the three main extraterrestrial empires depicted in the [[Marvel Universe]], alongside the [[Kree]] and [[Skrull]].

==Publication history==
The Shi'ar first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #97 (Feb. 1976) and were created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Dave Cockrum]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |pages=324–325}}</ref>

==Biology==
The Shi'ar are [[Ectotherm|cold-blooded]]<ref name="Astonish57">''Astonishing X-Men'' vol. 3 #57. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[humanoid]]s of [[wikt:avian|avian]] descent; they resemble [[human]]s with [[feather]]ed crests atop their [[head (anatomy)|head]]s in lieu of [[hair]]. Two different styles are common: most Shi'ar, particularly those of the [[aristocracy]], have feathers sprouting in a triangular shape away from the face, one peak on the top of the head and one peak on each side slightly over the shoulder; the other commonly seen "hairstyle" is bushy on both sides and very flat on the top.<ref name=ohotmis27>''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' vol. 2 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Internally, they have lightweight and hollow bones, and on their forearms there are still some vestigial feathers left of wings that were lost over millions of years of [[evolution]].<ref name="Avengers379">''The Avengers'' #379. Marvel Comics.</ref> The average Shi'ar can lift 1 ton in Earth-like gravity and has far greater stamina than the average human. Most Shi'ar have no other special abilities, though occasionally a genetic throwback appears possessing wings that allow for flight (an example of  [[atavism]]).<ref>''All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Marvel Encyclopedia'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> The superhuman Shi'ar can at least lift one ton through exercise.<ref name=ohotmis27/> [[Wasp (Marvel Comics)|Wasp]] stated that the Shi'ar aren't stronger than the Humans.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #81. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Shi'ar conceive their offspring in eggs. They are nurtured in special chambers and the children are referred to as [[hatchling]]s.{{issue|date=June 2019}}

The Shi'ar have more [[chakras]] than a human.<ref>''A+X'' #15. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Unlike Humans the Shi'ar do not dream, except for those born "defective" or "infected by dreams".<ref name="Astonish57" /> Such Shi'ar include Warbird and the Shi'ar having survived the Fianden's weapons.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' vol. 3 #58. Marvel Comics.</ref>

There have also been Shi'ar who had developed superpowers such as Electron, Rook'shir, Deathcry, Dakari, White Noise and Black Light.<ref>''X-Men: Messiah Complex - Mutant Files'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> This can be explained as most of them are members of the Imperial Family and because of Rook'shir, who had transmitted his Phoenix Force manipulation power to his descendants.<ref name="Uncanny479">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #479. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Some Shi'ar have also telepathic abilities.<ref name="Uncanny483">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #483. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Technology==
The Shi'ar possess technologies common to most Marvel alien races, including:

* [[Starship]]s capable of moving [[faster-than-light]]<ref name="Uncanny483" />
* Energy-based weapons in their ships and in their handheld weapons<ref name="xmen135mc" /><ref name="ucyxm157">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #157. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref name="SpotlightStarjammers1">''X-Men: Spotlight on...Starjammers'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>
* [[Force shield|force fields]]<ref name="ucxm2425">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #485. Marvel Comics.</ref>
* Faster-than-light communication{{issue|date=June 2019}}
* [[Teleportation]] technology<ref>''X-Men: Kingbreaker'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>
* [[Robot]]s<ref name="ucxm2425"/>
* [[Missile]]s<ref name='icx-m2353'/>

The Shi'ar also possess technologies fairly unusual to them, including:

* [[Hologram]] technology: which is used by the X-Men in their [[Danger Room]].<ref name='icx-m2353'>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #476. Marvel Comics.</ref>
* Cloaking technology: rendering a craft completely invisible, used by the X-Men on their [[Blackbird (comics)|Blackbird]] aircraft.{{issue|date=June 2019}}
* Stargates: Devices in a network system. They are used for travel to faraway distances including instantaneous travel between galaxies. There are planet-based Stargates (used for personal travel to other solar systems and galaxies) and enormous space-based versions (used for starships to travel through).<ref name="Xmen105">''X-Men'' #105. Marvel Comics.</ref>
* Starcracker technology: This is the Shi'ar ultimate weapon. The Starcracker causes stars to go supernova.<ref name="wok1mc"/>
* Warp-Capable Warships: Ranging in size from small starships to planetoid sized ships.<ref name="ucyxm157"/>
* Armageddon-class Killstations: Orbital battle space stations.<ref name="xmev1" />
* Flying Walker-Spacecraft: Spaceships with walker-like legs used on land.<ref name='icx-m2353'/>
* Nega-Bomb: A Galactic-level weapon used to destroy Dwarf Galaxies, like the Large Magellanic Cloud.<ref>''Wonder Man'' #8-9. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref name="Avengers347">''The Avengers'' #347. Marvel Comics.</ref> There are also lower yield Nega-Bombs used to destroy planets.<ref>''War of Kings'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>
* Fusion Space Mines<ref name="Starjammers1">''Starjammers'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

According to a statement by [[Emma Frost]] in ''The Astonishing X-Men'' #9, most if not all Shi'ar technology is [[sentience|sentient]].<ref>''X-Men'' #108. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Culture==
===Language===
A Shi'ar "Galaxian" has stated that they have learned nearly every spoken language.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #477. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Shi'ar have multiple forms, including the High Shi'ar, used for formal events,<ref name="Unlimited5">''X-Men Unlimited'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> and Shi'ar Glorkon dialect.<ref>''All-New X-Men'' #24. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Mostly for tactical terms or insults, the Shi'ar insert words of their language into English sentences.{{issue|date=June 2019}}

===Philosophy===
Traditionally, the Imperium has aggressively absorbed new cultures. [[Warren Ellis]]' 1995 ''[[Starjammers]]'' limited series described the story of the Shi'ar deities [[Sharra]] and [[K'ythri]] as a parable which guides the Shi'ar expansionist philosophy to other worlds:

<blockquote>Sharra and K'ythri are the gods in marriage. The gods who didn't want to marry, but were forced into it. In marriage they found strength and in strength they found love. That's what the Shi'ar Imperium does. It marries other cultures. Shotgun weddings.</blockquote><ref>''Starjammers'' #1-4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

There are aggressive and violent ancient traditions, such as the Rite of Arin'nn Haelar, which is a battle to the death. This rite can be invoked to settle disagreements and their outcomes are accepted by the Imperium.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 3 #35. Marvel Comics.</ref> Their philosophy also impact their court as they don't recognize insanity.<ref>''Thanos'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

X-Men writer [[Ed Brubaker]] compared the Shi'ar to ''[[Star Trek]]'''s [[Romulan]]s, saying they are "smart, aggressive, and mean".<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=101434 Uncanny in Space - Talking X-Men With Ed Brubaker] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015195321/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=101434 |date=2007-10-15 }}, [[Newsarama]], February 12, 2007 (accessed 15 Feb 2007)</ref>

===Politics===
Though the empire has grown to include hundreds of thousands of different sentient species and worlds, the Shi'ar race controls and governs the empire. Its central base of power is located on the "throneworld" Chandilar, while the Shi'ar homeworld is called Aerie (it is unknown if the planet still exists). The leader of the empire is given the title Majestor (male) or Majestrix (female) and is a [[heredity|hereditary]] position, occupied by members of the royal family of the Shi'ar. Formerly, the Neramani family represented the royal bloodline.<ref name='ohotmus'>''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Shi'ar Empire is one of the most advanced and expansive civilizations in the universe, spanning entire [[Galaxy|galaxies]]. It is mainly an economic co-operative, where trade with other galactic powers is its driving force. Not all races have the same rights in the Imperium, as the Shi'ar appear to have a disproportionate influence on its governance.

It is nominally ruled over by a high council, which has representatives from a large majority of the alien races that exist within the Imperium. However, in practice, the head of the council (the Majestor or Majestrix) exercises strong executive control and can institute policy virtually by decree.

The leader of the Shi'ar empire is protected by his or her own personal guard called the [[Imperial Guard (Marvel Comics)|Imperial Guard]], which is made up of the most powerful and elite soldiers from throughout the Empire with most of them being Shi'ar and others being from other alien races in the Shi'ar's jurisdiction.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=181}}</ref> The Imperial Guard is led by a [[praetor]]. The military itself (outside of the Imperial Guard) has been depicted as consisting almost exclusively of Shi'ar personnel, at least in most of the command positions.<ref name='ohotmus'/><ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #471. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Though having warlike and militaristic ancestry, the Shi'ar Empire has largely occupied the role of peacekeepers in many interstellar affairs. Just to name a few, [[Lilandra Neramani|Empress Lilandra Neramani]] tried to broker peace between the [[Kree|Kree Empire]] and the [[Skrull|Skrull Empire]] to help bring an end to their devastating war: she sought interstellar accord when deciding how to end the threat of the [[Dark Phoenix Saga|Dark Phoenix]], and attempted to avenge the destruction of Tarnax IV, the Skrull throneworld, by [[Galactus]].

===Attitude toward the arts===
The Shi'ar consider artistic creativity to be a sign of insanity and deviance, as they lack the ability to dream. Shi'ar who have the ability to dream and create do all they can to suppress their impulses. In the past, execution was a common remedy to such 'infections'. A race called the Fianden had the ability to cause any Shi'ar to dream; this caused mass catatonia and insanity in most Shi'ar, although a small subset who already are able to dream recover after a brief delay. The Fianden were wiped out in a mass genocide. After they were used to destroy the Fianden, the Shi'ar executed all of the natural dreamers to purge the taint from their bloodlines. Nevertheless, the trait does still emerge periodically, to continued violent repression.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' vol. 3 #57-58. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Star-Lord'' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Fictional race biography==
After leaving their world, the Shi'ar started an intergalactic Empire and forced other cultures in order to become stronger and ruled for millions of years.<ref>''Marvel Encyclopedia #X-Men''. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Starjammers'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> Such cultures included the Chameloids, Lupaks, Stygians, Strontians, Hodinn, Saurids and many more. When the Shi'ar invaded the homeworld of the Mephitisoids, they declared to bring civilization to the primitive world. However this was a lie and the Mephitisoids had technology almost equal to the Shi'ar. The Shi'ar conquered the peaceful Mephistoids stealing their technology. However, the true history was lost to legend and propaganda.<ref name="Avengers379" />

When the Shi'ar known as Rook'shir was bonded to the Phoenix Force, he became Dark Phoenix and wreaked havoc across Shi'ar Empire. In order to stop him, the first Imperial Guard sent Gladiator after him, who killed him. For years all his descendants were culled, out of fear that one of them might host the Phoenix Force like their ancestor. Rook'shir left behind a sword known as the Blade of the Phoenix which contained a small portion of the Phoenix Force's power. The sword could only be lifted by Rook'shir's descendants. Korvus is the only known surviving descendant of Rook'shir.<ref name="Uncanny479" />

===M'Kraan Crystal===
{{Main|The Dark Phoenix Saga}}
D'Ken Neramani, a corrupt Shi'ar ruler, attempted to use the powerful [[M'Kraan Crystal]] to take over the universe. His younger sister Lilandra and her new allies, the X-Men, foiled his plans. He was rendered [[coma]]tose by the crystal and Lilandra then took over as the Majestrix of the Shi'ar Empire. The X-Men, as well as most of Earth's other superheroes, have had cordial if not friendly relations with the Shi'ar Empire ever since.<ref>''X-Men'' #107-109. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Trial of Galactus===
The Shi'ar put [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] on trial for the crimes of genocide. He was guilty of reviving Galactus after he was defeated on Earth. Shortly after his revival, Galactus proceeded to consume the [[Skrull]] throneworld, resulting in the death of billions. [[Uatu]] the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]], acting as his [[lawyer]] and with the help of [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] and Galactus himself, convinced the gathered tribunal that Galactus is a necessary force of betterment of the universe and is not a villain. This was done by summoning [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]]. The truth as shown by Eternity however, is so grand and overpowering that none of the tribunal's members can remember it fully, although the comprehension stays.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #261-262. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Deathbird, the Kree-Shi'ar War, and the Spartoi===
In the 1980s, Lilandra and D'Ken's unstable exiled elder sibling [[Deathbird]] made several attempts to overthrow her sister from power. Deathbird even resorted to attacking Lilandra's Earth-based allies in order to achieve her goals. She is also responsible for initially directing the alien parasites known as the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] towards the Earth and its heroes.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #162. Marvel Comics.</ref> Deathbird was eventually deposed with the assistance of the X-Men.<ref name="ReferenceB">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #275. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the 1992 [[fictional crossover|crossover]] "[[Operation: Galactic Storm]]," the Shi'ar annexed the [[Kree]] Empire at the end of the Kree-Shi'ar War and Deathbird was placed into a prominent position as [[viceroy]] of Hala, the Kree homeworld. However, Deathbird did not last long in this position and has since abandoned her responsibilities and it appears that the Kree Empire has, at least in some part, been re-established.

The Shi'ar have had recent contact with the [[Spartoi (comics)|Spartoi]].<ref>''Inhumans'' vol. 3 #3-4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Phalanx===
The empire came under the threat of the "techno-organic" alien race known as the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] after they infiltrated the Shi'ar Empire as the "Pure", killing tens of thousands before the X-Men fought them on the Shi'ar throneworld and separated the transmode virus from its hosts, killing most of those Phalanx.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #343-344. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Warlock'' #7-8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Cassandra Nova===
[[Professor X]]'s [[evil twin]] sister [[Cassandra Nova]] single-handedly destroys a good portion of the Shi'ar Empire. Inhabiting the body of her brother, Nova asserts control of Empress Lilandra and causes a Shi'ar civil war. Jean Grey is instrumental in ending this threat.<ref>''New X-Men'' #122-126. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Phoenix Endsong and End of Greys===
{{Main|X-Men: Phoenix – Endsong|End of Greys}}
Despite the aid she gave them by eliminating the threat of Cassandra Nova, the Shi'ar still held a grudge against Jean Grey for the destruction she caused as Dark Phoenix. In the [[X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong|Phoenix Endsong]] series, a group of Shi'ar tried to eliminate both the Phoenix Force and Jean Grey. Jean, however, escaped their [[suicide bomb]] attack and returned to the White Hot Room to restore herself.<ref>''X-Men Phoenix Endsong'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> In the "End of Greys" story arc, the Shi'ar wanted to wipe out the Grey [[genome]] and [[Quentin Quire]] with the purpose of eliminating the possibility of a new [[Omega-level mutant]] becoming a host for the Phoenix Force. The [[Shi'ar Death Commandos]] murdered Jean Grey's [[Dr. John Grey|father]], [[Gailyn Bailey|niece]], [[Joey Bailey|nephew]], and other relatives in an [[alien invasion]] on Earth, thus inciting the wrath of [[Rachel Summers]], the daughter of Jean Grey and Scott Summers from an alternate future, who has since declared vengeance on the entire Shi'ar Empire.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #466-468. Marvel Comics.</ref> Recent events seem to indicate the Shi'ar Council was responsible for this, and that Lilandra is unaware of what has been done in her name.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #481. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Fall of the Shi'ar===
{{Main|The Rise and Fall of the Shi'ar Empire}}
Another Shi'ar threat comes from an X-Men villain called [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]]. During his tenure as majestor of the empire, D'Ken killed Vulcan's mother Katherine Summers (also mother to longtime X-Men [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott]] and [[Havok (comics)|Alex Summers]]) and made him a slave for most of his adolescent life. Bent on revenge against D'Ken, Vulcan attacks the Empire. Not only that, but within the empire, there is a coup to dethrone Lilandra and return D'Ken to power, with the aid of Deathbird. The X-Men once again team up with their space allies, the [[Starjammers]], to stop both Vulcan and the plot to return rulership of the empire to D'Ken. In the end, Vulcan kills his father, [[Corsair (comics)|Corsair]], and D'Ken, and assumes the throne of the Shi'ar Empire for himself, with Deathbird as his queen; Lilandra and the Starjammers now lead a resistance against Vulcan's rule. This occurs in a 12 issue arc entitled "[[The Rise and Fall of the Shi'ar Empire]]".<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #475-486. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Emperor Vulcan===
{{Main|X-Men: Emperor Vulcan}}
The civil war between Vulcan's forces and those loyal to the dethroned Lilandra rages on. Led by Havok and the Starjammers, Lilandra's forces gradually whittle away at Vulcan's forces, which are plagued by defections. The Shi'ar, contrary to Vulcan's expectations, are not happy to have an outsider as their ruler. Vulcan is discouraged by this, but Deathbird convinces him that they will come to accept him.<ref name='xmev1'>''X-Men: Emperor Vulcan'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Warned in advance of a rebel raid on Feather's Edge, Vulcan and his fleet ambush the Starjammers. However, in the middle of the battle, his ship, the Hammer, is destroyed by the Scy'ar Tal (translates as "Death to the Shi'ar"). Vulcan and [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]] (still the praetor of his Imperial Guard) attack the leader of the Scy'ar Tal and are easily defeated, whereupon they retreat deeper into Shi'ar space.<ref name='xmev1'/>

Marvel Girl makes contact with the Eldest Scy'ar Tal and discovers their true origin. The Scy'ar Tal were originally called the M'Kraan. Early in their history, the Shi'ar attacked them, killed a great number of their people, making the rest flee for their lives. Eventually, the Shi'ar settled on their planet, took the M'Kraan Crystal as their own, and passed down the legend of the M'Kraan Crystal as a sacred gift from their deities, Sharra & K'ythri. The M'Kraan then changed their name to Scy'ar Tal and devoted their culture and society to the destruction of the Shi'ar Empire. With their first attack, they destroyed Feather's Edge by transporting a star to obliterate it. After which, Vulcan makes contact with the Starjammers to call a temporary ceasefire.<ref name="ReferenceC">''X-Men: Emperor Vulcan'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Under the ceasefire, the Shi'ar and the Starjammers decide to take out the Finality, thus crippling the Scy'ar's biggest threat. Once Havok and Vulcan are in position to destroy Finality, the Eldest Scy'ar tries to stop them. Once Vulcan figures out how the Eldest is powered, he severs the connection Eldest has with his brothers, making him powerless. Once the connection is severed, the Scy'ar become disorganized, and the tide of the battle shifts to the Sh'ar. The Shi'ar then proceed to attack both the Scy'ar and the Starjammers. Meanwhile, Vulcan blasts Havok into a sun.

Vulcan decides to use Finality to destroy the Scy'ar by using the weapon to place a star in the middle of their fleet. Alex returns and, having absorbed enough power to burn him, decides to end things with Vulcan. While they battle, Rachel and Korvus try, but fail to stop the beacon that will initiate the attack by the Shi'ar. The Shi'ar Imperial Guard end Alex's battle with Vulcan by appearing with the Starjammers in captivity, threatening to kill them. Before surrendering, Alex destroys Finality. With Alex and the Starjammers in custody Vulcan declares that he will return the Shi'ar Empire to its former glory.<ref>''X-Men: Emperor Vulcan'' #5 (Mar. 2008).</ref>

===X-Men: Kingbreaker===
{{Main|X-Men: Kingbreaker}}
Vulcan and the Shi'ar were featured prominently in the mini-series X-Men: Kingbreaker that revolved around Vulcan and the Starjammers following the conclusion of the mini-series Emperor Vulcan. This mini-series led to the War of Kings event and revealed that eons ago the Shi'ar, used dark sorcery to created and stored in Null Space the Tree of Shadows which is the repository for all of the Darkhawk amulets used to empower the Fraternity of Raptors to whom the Shi'ar intended to use to maintain the Shi'ar Empire as it evolved over the centuries. The Fraternity of Raptors refer to their mission to protect the long term interests of the empire as "The Great Purpose."<ref>''War of Kings: Ascension'' #2</ref> However, as the Shi'ar Empire aggressively expanded so to did the Fraternity of Raptors and eventually they grew too powerful for the Empire to control. Therefore, they all were sealed in patches of dark matter throughout Shi'ar territory and their history almost completely forgotten.<ref>''War of Kings: Darkhawk'' #2</ref>

===War of Kings===
{{Main|War of Kings}}
The story revolved around the [[Starjammers]], the Shi'ar, the [[Inhumans]], the Kree, the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], and the [[Nova Corps]].<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080727-WarofKings.html SDCC '08 - Abnett & Lanning on Marvel's 'War of Kings'], [[Newsarama]], July 27, 2008</ref>

The Shi'ar end up in conflict with the Inhumans and the Kree. After the death of Lilandra and the presumed deaths of Vulcan and [[Black Bolt]], Gladiator assumes the throne and surrenders to the Inhumans and the Kree when the damage to the Shi'ar military is too much.

===Infinity===
During the "[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]" storyline, it is revealed that at some point, the Shi'ar managed to take control of their own empire back from the Kree as Gladiator appears as a member of the Galactic Council representing the Shi'ar Empire.<ref>''Infinity'' #3</ref>

===Time Runs Out===
When the Shi'ar found out that the reason for the decay of the universe was on Earth, they decided to destroy the planet.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 5 #41. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] managed to warn the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] about the attack.<ref>''Avengers'' vol 5. #42. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When approaching Earth, the Shi'ar alerted humanity about their destruction of Earth. However [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] and [[Advanced Idea Mechanics#Avengers Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] used a super weapon to retaliate against the Shi'ar, while [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s Avengers used a Planetkiller to attack from behind. However, A.I.M.'s weapon exploded due to overheat, and the Planetkiller was destroyed by the [[Annihilation Wave]]. The Avengers were ready to meet their end, but the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] intervened used the controller disk of a rogue planet that shared the same space with Earth, while Iron Man flew to the Sol's Hammer, and used it, successfully destroying the Shi'ar fleet, including the Imperial Guards.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 5 #43-44. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===All-New, All-Different Marvel===
As part of the "[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]," it was revealed that some Shi'ar that are living on Earth have established a Shi'ar corporation called Shi'ar Solutions Consolidations.<ref name="Mighty Thor #8">''The Mighty Thor'' vol. 2 #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

====Asgard/Shi'ar War====
During "The Asgard/Shi'ar War" storyline, the Shi'ar Gods Sharra and K'ythri do a "Challenge of the Gods" by bringing the Shi'ar fleet to [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] whilst threatening Earth with their Super Destroyers.<ref name="Thor16">''The Mighty Thor'' vol. 2 #16. Marvel Comics.</ref> An event which had been secretly instigated by [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] behind closed doors.<ref name="Mighty Thor #17"/> In the Natural Disasters Round, Sharra and K'ythri use their power to cause a tidal wave in order to ferment greater worship in the survivors. Thor impedes their efforts by saving lives instead of claiming them, the round going to her as the living Shi'ar people are thankful for her mercy; much to her displeasure.<ref name="Thor15">''The Mighty Thor'' vol. 2 #15. Marvel Comics.</ref> Round after round where countless denizens of the Shi'ar are slaughtered in these inane divinity games weights heavily on Thor/Jane's conscience. Until finally after the Genesis Round, where the Shi'ar gods use dust to create Shi'ar Giants who indiscriminately murder more of their worshipers causes the [[Jane Foster (comics)|female Thor]] to fight them. As the female Thor failed to create life, the Shi'ar won the Genesis Round.<ref name="Mighty Thor #17">''The Mighty Thor'' vol. 2 #17. Marvel Comics.</ref> Having had enough of the murderous spectacles, Thor chose to directly challenge the Shi'ar gods; later receiving some unexpected help from the Asgardian Gods themselves. It was this act that tilted the Challenge of the Gods in her favor as none had ever brought so many divine under their banner to fight at their side before, causing the new Thor to be crowned winner of the Challenge. Greatly angered at such a turn of events Sharra and K'ythri order their Majestor to eviscerate her homeworld in retribution; but the Emperor of the Shi'ar rebel's against their gods after their wanton display.<ref>''The Mighty Thor'' vol. 2 #18. Marvel Comics.</ref> In their final fit of mindless ire, the Shi'ar gods summoned the Phoenix Force to eviscerate the galaxy spiting everyone who defied them. Later after a sorrowing battle following the appeasement of the Phoenix, the former gods of the empire are taken away to the dungeons of ''Omnipotence City'' for their crimes and reckless actions. All while [[Quentin Quire|Kid Omega]], holder of a Phoenix Force shard, acts as a stand in for the divinity of the Shi'ar empire.<ref>''The Mighty Thor'' vol. 2 #19. Marvel Comics.</ref>

====Infinity Countdown====
During the [[Infinity Countdown|search of the Infinity Stones]], Razor reveals the true origin of the Tree of Shadows and the creation of the Fraternity of Raptors, according to Razor the Tree of Shadows was created eons ago by the [[Elders of the Universe|Elder of the Universe]] known as The Gardener who tried to bring life to the Null Space and planted it in the [[Darkforce Dimension]]. Eventually, Null Space and the Tree of Shadows were discovered by a more pre-historic version of the Shi'ar and the Skrulls, a find that ended in war erupting between the two alien races.

'''Tombstone''' ('''Alonzo "Lonnie" Thompson Lincoln''') is a <!--Do not add "fictional" as it is tautological; supervillains (and characters in general) are by definition implied to be fictionalized to some extent.-->[[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Depicted as a hulking [[albino]] man with [[human teeth sharpening|filed teeth]], Tombstone is a notorious crime boss in [[New York City]]. He is primarily an enemy of [[Spider-Man]] and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], and the father of [[Janice Lincoln]]. He also has ties to Spider-Man's ally and friend [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Robbie Robertson]].

The character has appeared in several media adaptations outside of comics over the years, including animated series and video games. Tombstone made his cinematic debut in the 2018 animated film ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]'', voiced by [[Krondon|Marvin "Krondon" Jones III]].

==Publication history==
The character was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Alex Saviuk]] and first appeared in ''[[Web of Spider-Man]]'' #36 (March 1988).<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=383}}</ref> The character was immediately established to have a history with longtime Spider-Man [[supporting character]] [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Joseph "Robbie" Robertson]], and was brought on as a regular in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', which was then being written by Conway. Conway explained why he created Tombstone: "My general motivation was a need to work with the characters who weren't central to ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' title, since that was the main book. That meant I needed to focus my attention not on [[Aunt May]] or [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]], or even [[J. Jonah Jameson]], but on second- or even third-tier supporting characters. Joe Robertson was one of those. The second motive had to do with my desire to bring back the ruthless gangster [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] had been, but not Hammerhead himself. It just came to me as a character type. One thing led to another, and as his backstory expanded, readers responded well to it."<ref>{{cite journal|last= Williams|first= Scott E.|date= October 2010|title= Gerry Conway: Everything but the Gwen Stacy Sink|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 44| page= 17|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Born as Lonnie Thompson Lincoln in [[Harlem]], he started out as a troubled youth who was bullied by his peers because he was the neighborhood's only [[African Americans|African-American]] [[Albinism in humans|albino]]. Taller and stronger than the other children, the young Lincoln started his life of crime in school, extorting [[protection money]] from his classmates. The school newspaper, edited by [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Joseph "Robbie" Robertson]], was going to run a story exposing these illegal activities, but pulled it when Lincoln used scare tactics to intimidate Robertson. Lincoln allowed his personal demons to direct the course of his life and dropped out to join the ranks of organized crime.<ref name=autogenerated2>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #139. Marvel Comics.</ref> As a [[hitman]] and enforcer, he used his albinism to his advantage. He filed his teeth and nails to points, giving him the appearance of a [[vampire]]. This frequently caught his opponents off-guard, making it easier to kill them. He also lifted weights and engaged in many street fights to hone his fighting skills. One night, Robertson, now working for a local paper, went to meet a source only to see the source being killed by Lincoln. He threatened to kill Robertson if the story was brought out. Robertson kept the secret for over 20 years, allowing Lincoln to continue his rise through the criminal underworld.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #137. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Now known as "Tombstone" for the many lives he had taken, he returned to New York City as the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]]'s top hitman.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #36. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Manning |first2=Matthew K. |title=Spider-Man Chronicle: Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging |date=2012 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-0756692360 |page=169}}</ref> He threw the [[Jason Macendale|Hobgoblin]] out of the Arranger's window.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #38. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, he captured a mutant known as the Persuader for the Arranger.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #138. Marvel Comics.</ref> Tombstone eventually returned to Robertson's neighborhood, where the reporter finally worked up the nerve to challenge him. He revealed the decades-old murder to the police, resulting in Tombstone's arrest, but not before Tombstone confronted and seriously injured Robertson, nearly permanently damaging his spine.<ref name=autogenerated2/> Tombstone then encountered [[Spider-Man]] in [[Atlanta]]; Tombstone was defeated and sent to the Philadelphia State Penitentiary.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #142. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Robertson was also incarcerated for suppression of evidence. On learning this, Tombstone obtained a transfer to Lewisburg State Penitentiary where Robertson was serving his sentence. There, he killed an inmate named Bruiser who died trying to protect his friend Robertson. Tombstone eventually broke out of prison but was confronted by [[Spider-Man]]; he eluded capture after a harrowing battle in which he nearly beat Spider-Man to death before Robertson stopped him. Tombstone and Robertson were knocked into the Susquehana River. Tombstone brought a badly-injured Robertson to an Amish family so that Robertson could recover enough to give him a decent fight. When Tombstone finally made his move to kill Robertson in retaliation for turning on him during the fight with Spider-Man, Robertson stabbed Tombstone with a pitchfork and then escaped. Tombstone switched allegiances by joining the crime family headed by the Kingpin's rivals [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] and the [[Chameleon (Marvel Comics)|Chameleon]], and then saved Robertson from the Hobgoblin so that he could kill his old foe himself.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #150, 153, 155, 157, 161. Marvel Comics.</ref> Robertson earned a full pardon from the government for helping recapture Tombstone.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #161. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Tombstone eventually gained a [[superhuman]] physical constitution. This was the result of his last attempt to kill Robertson, this time at an Oscorp chemical plant. Robertson shot Tombstone and trapped him in an airtight test chamber which contained an experimental gas. The gas was absorbed into Tombstone's bloodstream and had a mutagenic effect on his body, enhancing his strength and heightening his other physical abilities. Tombstone then called off his vendetta against Robertson in gratitude.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #66-68. Marvel Comics.</ref> Tombstone was later defeated by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and the [[Punisher]] while competing against the [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] in a real game of [[Assassin (game)|Assassin]] sponsored by the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #292-293.

==Powers and abilities==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
Originally, Lonnie Lincoln had no superhuman powers; rather, he was simply abnormally tall with near-peak human strength. Lincoln later gained actual superpowers through artificial means as a result of a mutagenic reaction to an experimental preservative gas absorbed into his bloodstream. He possesses physical strength that has been increased far beyond his original limits to superhuman levels. Tombstone's body is highly resistant to physical injury and is capable of withstanding extreme temperatures, great impact forces, high caliber bullets, and toxic gases without sustaining injury. His reflexes, speed, and stamina are likewise heightened beyond a range attainable for normal human beings.

Aside from these advantages, Tombstone is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant with years of street fighting experience and, even before gaining powers, was easily capable of killing someone with his bare hands. He now combines his street-fighting skills with his superhuman strength to create a unique fighting style that relies on intense speed and force to overwhelm his opponents. He is also highly proficient with conventional firearms and well-connected in the world of organized crime.

As an albino, Tombstone is sensitive to sunlight due to a natural deficiency of [[melanin]]. He is usually depicted as only being capable of speaking in whispers. However, after the exposure to gas at Oscorp, he has been depicted speaking in tones approaching normal vocal tones.

Tombstone has [[human teeth sharpening|filed all his teeth into razor-sharp points]], but this is largely just a means of intimidation; he rarely uses them to inflict any physical harm.

==Other versions==
===MC2===
An older version of Tombstone appears in the ''Spectacular Spider-Girl'' digital comic series, set in the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe.

Despite his advanced years, Tombstone still proved to be a tough opponent to defeat.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://marvel.com/digitalcomics/titles/Spectacular_Spider-Girl.2009.3 |title=Spectacular Spider-Girl &#124; Read Spectacular Spider-Girl Comics Online Issue #3 &#124; Marvel Digital Comics Unlimited |access-date=2009-06-11 |archive-date=2009-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614203947/http://marvel.com/digitalcomics/titles/SPECTACULAR_SPIDER-GIRL.2009.3 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

He met Spider-Girl and did battle with her. But when he saw [[Alternative versions of Venom#Mayhem (April Parker)|another Spider-Girl]] saving people from a burning building on TV, Tombstone grew furious and rapidly finished her off. {{Issue|date=July 2009}}

When Tombstone met the Blue Spider-Girl, he revealed to her that he killed the other Spider-Girl, which caused her to attack him in rage.

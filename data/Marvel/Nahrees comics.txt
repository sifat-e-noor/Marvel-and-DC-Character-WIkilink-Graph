The '''Inhumans''' are a fictional superhuman race of [[superheroes]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The comic book series has usually focused more specifically on the adventures of the '''Inhuman Royal Family''', and many people associate the name "Inhumans" with this particular team of superpowered characters.

The Inhumans first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #45 (December 1965), though members [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] and [[Gorgon (Inhuman)|Gorgon]] appeared in earlier issues of that series (#36 and #44, respectively). Their home, the city of [[Attilan]], was first mentioned years earlier, in a ''Tuk the Caveboy'' story written and drawn by [[Jack Kirby]] that appeared in ''Captain America Comics'' #1 (March 1941). The city was described as the home of a race that was evolutionarily advanced when human beings were still in the Stone Age.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Cronin |first=Brian |date=2017-10-05 |title=When Was the Inhumans' Home First Called Attilan? |url=https://www.cbr.com/inhumans-attilan-debut/ |website=[[Comic Book Resources]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Brief history of Ancient Aliens in Pop Culture & Comic Books (with Jack Kirby & Steve Ditko) by Alex Grand |url=https://comicbookhistorians.com/brief-history-of-ancient-aliens-in-pop-culture-comic-books-with-jack-kirby/ |access-date=2022-03-10 |website=comicbookhistorians.com}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Johnston |first=Rich |author-link=Rich Johnston |date=2019-07-23 |title=Tuk The Caveboy Responsible For The X-Men?

The Inhuman Royal Family has been adapted to numerous Marvel animated series and video games over the years. Inhuman characters were introduced in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) in live action in the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 2)|second season]] of ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', while the Inhuman Royal Family is featured in the television series ''[[Inhumans (TV series)|Inhumans]]'', which premiered in 2017; the latter show was critically panned and lasted only one season. Earlier, a proposed film adaptation of the Inhumans was announced in 2014 by [[Marvel Studios]] but was later removed from its slate and never came to fruition. The Inhumans did make it to the big screen in the 2022 feature film ''[[Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness]]''.

==Development==
In a 1967 interview, Stan Lee discussed the creation of the Inhumans: "The first Inhuman that we brought in was [[Gorgon (Inhuman)|Gorgon]]... And he was a fella who looked a little like a [[centaur]] or something. He could kick his foot very hard and he had great power. He could shatter a mountain by kicking his foot. He started out as a villain. We liked him so much, I should say Jack liked him so much, that he kept using him. We figured he has to come from somewhere. We decided, let him come from some strange land over in [[Europe]], where there are a whole group of people like him. And well, what else could you call them except the Inhumans. Then Jack had to create a whole bunch of Inhumans and I think he did a great job. When it came to doing the leader, we decided, well, there was no need for them all to be villainous. I think we did have in mind that [[Black Bolt]] would eventually be a heroic type. And again, we always try to give a character a hangup so his hangup is he doesn’t speak."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://kirbymuseum.org/blogs/effect/category/interview/ | title=Interview }}</ref>

==Fictional species biography==
At the beginning of the [[Kree-Skrull War]], millions of years ago in [[Earth]] time, the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[Kree]] established a station on the planet [[Uranus in fiction|Uranus]], a strategic position between the Kree and [[Skrull]] empires. Through their work at this station, they discovered that sentient life on nearby [[Earth]] had genetic potential invested in it by the alien [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]]. Intrigued, the Kree began to experiment on Earth's then-primitive race ''Homo sapiens'' to produce the genetically advanced Inhuman race. Their goal was apparently twofold—to investigate possible ways of circumventing their own evolutionary stagnation, and to create a powerful mutant race of soldiers for use against the Skrulls.<ref name=i14>{{cite book|last = Pacheco|first = Carlos|author-link = Carlos Pacheco|author2 = [[Rafael Marín|Marín, Rafael]]; [[José Ladrönn|Ladrönn, José]]|title = Fantastic Four/Inhumans|publisher = Marvel Comics|year = 2007|page = 192|isbn = 978-0785127031|quote= Collects ''Inhumans'' vol. 3 #1–4}}</ref> Although their experiments were successful in creating a strain of humanity with extraordinary abilities, the Kree abandoned their experiment because a genetic prophecy had predicted that the experiments would eventually lead to an anomaly who would destroy the Kree Supreme Intelligence.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Jonathan Hickman|Hickman, Jonathan]]|penciller= [[Greg Tocchini|Tocchini, Greg]]|inker= Tocchini, Greg|story= Two Kings|title= [[Future Foundation|FF]]|issue= #6|date= September 2011}}</ref>

Born approximately 50,000 BC, Tuk the Caveboy was the first offspring of the Inhumans.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web |title=Tuk the Caveboy (Pre-Marvel character) |url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix6/tuk_caveboy.htm |access-date=2022-03-10 |website=www.marvunapp.com}}</ref><ref>''History of the Marvel Universe'' Vol 2. #1 (July 2019) [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

Their test subjects, the Inhumans, went on to form a society of their own, which thrived in seclusion from the rest of humanity and developed advanced technology. Experiments with the [[mutagen]]ic Terrigen Mist (a process known as Terrigenesis) gave them various powers, but caused lasting genetic damage and deformities, which led to a long-term [[selective breeding]] program in an attempt to mitigate the effects of these mutations.  The Terrigen Mist is a natural mutagen, arising as a vapor from the Terrigen Crystals, which are able to alter Inhuman biology. The Mists were discovered by the Inhuman [[geneticist]] Randac approximately 25,000 years ago. He immersed himself in the Mists and gained mental powers comparable to the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]].<ref>''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' #146–147 (1967)</ref>  After centuries of [[eugenics]] and [[birth control]], the Inhumans managed to mitigate the genetic damage and cultivated a more responsible use of the Terrigen Mists. The practice they developed was to let only genetically perfect specimens undergo the random mutations provoked by the Mists. Their theory was that genetic screening could avoid the risk of hideous and animal mutations in an individual. However, there are examples throughout the Inhumans' canon where an exposed Inhuman became a devolved, sometimes mindless, evolutionarily inferior throw-back. The term [[Inhumans#Alpha Primitives|Alpha Primitives]] was coined for these unfortunate outcasts of Inhuman society, who would for centuries become the breeding stock of a [[slave]] race. Resentment at this [[caste system]] sometimes bubbles up, and the Alpha Primitives have tried to overthrow their rulers in multiple storylines, often as a result of manipulation by a third party.

Attilan's society and culture are predicated on a conformist belief system that permits individuality as it applies to genetic development and physical and mental ability, but demands rigid conformity in that each member of society is assigned a place within that society according to those abilities following exposure to the Terrigen Mist.

Both Crystal and Medusa have been members of the [[Fantastic Four]]; Crystal has been a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] as well.

Black Bolt has guided the Inhumans through some of the most turbulent times in their history, including several attempts by Maximus to usurp the throne, revolts by the worker class (with their eventual emancipation), attacks by human renegades, the kidnapping of Medusa, the destruction and rebuilding of Attilan, and the revelation of the Inhumans' existence to humanity.

His role as king of the Inhumans has been tumultuous. The first major crisis occurred when he and Medusa conceived a [[Ahura (comics)|child]]. Medusa bore the child in defiance of the Genetic Council, who felt that Black Bolt's bloodline was too dangerous to pass on. The Council nonetheless took the child to examine and forbade parental contact. Medusa escaped to Earth with members of the royal family only to be harassed by Maximus. Black Bolt was torn between his love of family and his duty to respect the Genetic Council, and it was only when the Council was revealed to be using his son in a plot against him that he finally turned against the Council. With that, he gave up the crown as king of the Inhumans. For a while, they lived away from Attilan, but returned in times of need.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= [[Ann Nocenti|Nocenti, Ann]]|penciller= [[Bret Blevins|Blevins, Bret]]|inker= [[Al Williamson|Williamson, Al]]|story= By Right of Birth|title= The Inhumans -- A Marvel Graphic Novel|issue= #1|date= 1988}}</ref>

The once-secret existence of the race has come to light among the general public as the Inhumans interact more often with many of Earth's [[superhero]]es—including the [[Fantastic Four]], the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], and the [[X-Men]]—whom they have aided against threats such as [[Doctor Doom]],<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]]|penciller= [[Paul Ryan (cartoonist)|Ryan, Paul]]|inker= Bulanadi, Danny|story= It's Always Darkest Before the...DOOM!|title= Fantastic Four|issue= #375|date= April 1993}}</ref> [[Ultron|Ultron 7]],<ref name="FF150" /><ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Steve Englehart|Englehart, Steve]]|penciller= [[Sal Buscema|Buscema, Sal]]|inker= [[Joe Staton|Staton, Joe]]|story= Bride and Doom!|title= The [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]|issue= #127|date= September 1974}}</ref> [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], and [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Jim Lee|Lee, Jim]]; [[Whilce Portacio|Portacio, Whilce]]; [[Chris Claremont|Claremont, Chris]]|penciller= Portacio, Whilce|inker= [[Art Thibert|Thibert, Art]]|story= Endgame Part 3: Lunar Opposition|title= [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]|issue= #67|date= June 1991}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Jim; Portacio, Whilce; Claremont, Chris|penciller= Portacio, Whilce|inker= Thibert, Art|story= Finale|title= X-Factor|issue= #68|date= July 1991}}</ref> However, no one came to the Inhumans' aid when an army of Portuguese mercenaries attacked Attilan, which was now located on risen Atlantean ruins.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Jenkins, Paul|penciller= Lee, Jae|inker=Lee, Jae |story= Sonic Youth|title= Inhumans|volume= 2|issue= #1|date= November 1998}}</ref> This was actually a [[coup-d'etat]] orchestrated by Black Bolt's brother Maximus the Mad.

Inhuman society changed radically when [[Ronan the Accuser]] sought to use the Inhumans as an army to disrupt the [[Shi'ar]] control of the Kree after their defeat in the [[Operation: Galactic Storm|Kree-Shi'ar War]]. Appearing over the city of Attilan, Ronan seized control in a surprise attack and forced the Inhumans and their king, Black Bolt, to obey, or he would destroy their only home and everyone in it. He also exiled Maximus and the Alpha Primitives to the Negative Zone. During their time in forced servitude, Ronan revealed that the Inhumans had always been intended as weapons in service to the Kree. To this end, much of the genetic attributes that were encoded in them during the original experiments were meant to give them the abilities and appearances of various alien races, the idea being that these Inhuman slaves could be used to infiltrate alien worlds and races to conduct espionage or assassinations to weaken potential conquests. Ronan used the Inhumans to launch attacks on ships and bases, disrupt a treaty between the Shi'ar and Spartax, and manipulate Black Bolt to assassinate Empress [[Lilandra Neramani|Lilandra]].<ref name="i14" />

Eventually, Black Bolt sought to free his people by challenging Ronan to a personal battle. If Ronan won, the Inhumans would continue to serve him. If the king won, the Inhumans would go free. After a terrible battle, Black Bolt won and Ronan, demonstrating that the Kree still had honor, kept his word and left the Inhumans. All was not over, as the Inhumans were not willing to just follow Black Bolt back to Earth. Pressure had been building in the closed society of Attilan since open contact with the outside world had been made. During their enslavement by Ronan, the Inhumans had wished for their freedom, but had developed a sense of pride in their power and a belief in their own destiny. They no longer believed that Black Bolt or the Royal Family was fit to lead them in the new life they wanted, and they exiled the Royal Family from Attilan.<ref name="i14" /> The Royal Family returned to Earth to find their destiny. After suffering bigotry while living in the Baxter Building with the Fantastic Four and turning down political asylum from Latveria by Dr. Doom, the royal family returned to Attilan, which was located on the Blue Area of the Moon.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= [[Carlos Pacheco|Pacheco, Carlos]]; [[Rafael Marín|Marín, Rafael]]; [[Karl Kesel|Kesel, Karl]]|penciller= [[Mark Bagley|Bagley, Mark]]|inker= Kesel, Karl; Vey, Al|story= Eye of the Beholder|title= [[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]|volume= 3|issue= #51|date= March 2002}}<br />{{cite comic|writer= Pacheco, Carlos; Marín, Rafae; Kesel, Karl|penciller= Bagley, Mark|inker= Vey, Al|story= Shadows of Doom|title= Fantastic Four|volume= 3|issue= #52|date= April 2002}}<br />{{cite comic|writer= Pacheco, Carlos; Marín, Rafae; Kesel, Karl|penciller= Bagley, Mark|inker= Vey, Al|story= The Fire This Time!|title= Fantastic Four|volume= 3|issue= #53|date= May 2002}}<br />{{cite comic|writer= Pacheco, Carlos; Marín, Rafae; Kesel, Karl|penciller= Bagley, Mark|inker= Vey, Al|story= A Choice of Dooms!|title= Fantastic Four|volume= 3|issue= #54|date= June 2002}}</ref> The Inhumans attempted to foster better relations with Earth by [[Student exchange program|sending students]] to the [[University of Wisconsin]].<ref>{{cite book|last = McKeever|first = Sean|author-link = Sean McKeever|author2=Clark, Matthew|title = Young Inhumans ''collecting'' Inhumans ''vol. 4 issues #1-12''|publisher = Marvel Comics|year = 2008|page = 272|isbn = 978-0785133827}}</ref>

The theft led to a conflict on [[Genosha]] between the re-powered mutants (whose powers came back as too powerful for their own good causing their eventual surrender), the Inhumans, and the U.S. [[Office of National Emergency]].

With some help from the Kree, they rescue Black Bolt and return to Attilan.<ref name="Pokaski" /> The story itself ignores the ending of Silent War, with Medusa being under Maximus's mental thrall, Atilan's destruction, and Maximus having seized control over the Inhuman population via his mental powers save for Black Bolt and Luna (who are immune to his telepathy).

Finally deciding that they will no longer be used and abused by other races, the Inhumans take drastic action to ensure their survival as a race. To that end, they activate a series of long dormant machines beneath the city of Attilan, transforming it into a gigantic starship, powered by Black Bolt's voice. Breaking free from its resting place on the Moon, Attilan enters hyperspace and tracks down the remnants of the Skrull Armada, completely eradicating it. As Attilan enters Shi'ar space, it attracts the attention of three Shi'ar warships, who order them to depart or they will open fire. They too are destroyed without mercy.

Attilan reaches the planet Hala, destroying the protective shield that guards their weakened empire and enter the planet itself. The Royal Family confronts [[Ronan the Accuser]], who is serving as king.

===''Death of the Inhumans''===
{{Main|Death of the Inhumans}}
The Kree have initiated a murdering campaign in order to force Black Bolt to join the Kree Empire. This ultimatum causes the deaths of thousands of Inhumans with the word "Join or Die" carved into their bodies which forced Black Bolt to call together the four Queens of the Universal Inhuman tribes to respond to this threat. However, the meeting goes far from as planned, as an Inhuman executioner named Vox, a Super-Inhuman created by the Kree, begins his bloody rampage across the place. When Black Bolt and his Royal Family reached the meeting place, they discover the bodies of Oola Udonta, Aladi Ko Eke, Onomi Whitemane and Goddess Ovoe, with the same three words written in their blood on a banner hanging about their corpses and eventually realized that they fell in to a trap as one of the dead Inhumans was wired with an explosive. While most of Black Bolt's group made it out alive, thanks to Lockjaw, Triton was not so lucky and was killed in the explosion. Black Bolt then sent Lockjaw to New Arctilan to retrieve his brother Maximus. Unbeknownst to them, Vox and his men had already arrived on New Arctilan and began murdering every Inhuman they come across, old or new. Armed with all of the Inhumans’ abilities and no humanity, Vox easily cuts his prey down with his powers or his energy scythe. Even Maximus cannot defeat Vox, as he quickly loses an arm for even making the attempt. Pretty soon, Lockjaw arrived and stood up with Maximus to attempted to stop Vox on their own but things did not go so well and Vox fired an enormous blast, ripping a hole in both of them.<ref name="DeathofInhumans1">{{cite comic|writer= [[Donny Cates|Cates, Donny]]|penciller= [[Ariel Olivetti|Olivetti, Ariel]]|inker= Olivetti, Ariel|story= Chapter One: Vox|title=[[Death of the Inhumans]]|issue= #1|date= September 2018}}</ref>

When Karnak is sent to the Kree to relay a message from Black Bolt to them, the Kree Commander explains how they dispatched Ronan the Accuser as leader of the Kree after Hala was placed in ruin by [[J'son (comics)|Mister Knife]] and have begun to forge a new life. When asked to kneel, Karnak does not. Instead, he does his best to fend off Vox only for the Super-Inhuman to subdue Karnak. As Black Bolt arrives, he walks through the halls of the Kree base speaking every name of the fallen Inhumans, making it a song about death. Eventually, it comes down to just Black Bolt vs. Vox who is holding Karnak as a shield. Black Bolt signs to Karnak to have Vox take him instead. Vox apparently accepts the change as he teleports himself behind Black Bolt. Before Karnak's very eyes, Vox slits Black Bolt's throat.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Cates, Donny|penciller= Olivetti, Ariel|inker= Olivetti, Ariel|story= Chapter Two: Speak and Destroy|title=Death of the Inhumans|issue= #2|date= October 2018}}</ref>

The Kree take Black Bolt prisoner and repair the damage done to his throat without using any sedatives or anesthesia to dull the pain which prompted them to think that Black Bolt's great power is gone when he does not scream and therefore the prophecy about the Midnight King is no longer a threat to the Kree. However while being transported, it turns out that he still has his voice, but it is faint. After killing several Kree, Black Bolt secures a firearm and finds Ronan the Accuser alive. However, he is a prisoner of Vox and having been experimented on alongside the Kree soldiers that are loyal to Ronan. Black Bolt learns of this when he sees that Ronan has been converted to a cyborg. At Ronan's request, Black Bolt enables him a mercy killing by whispering "You are forgiven." Elsewhere, Medusa and the surviving Inhuman Royal Family members try to recruit Beta Ray Bill in their fight against Vox and the Kree.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Cates, Donny|penciller= Olivetti, Ariel|inker= Olivetti, Ariel|story= Chapter Three: Silent Kingdom|title=Death of the Inhumans|issue= 3|date=November 2018}}</ref>

The Inhuman Royal Family are finally taking the battle to the Kree and arrive just in time to save Black Bolt from Vox. Thanks to the interference of Beta Ray Bill, the Inhuman Royal Family are able to overpower and kill Vox, but not before he is apparently able to kill Crystal. They soon realize to their surprise that Vox was actually Maximus in disguise concluding that the Super-Inhuman is not a person. Instead, it is a program and it is also revealed that the voice power that everyone assumes is vaporizing his targets was actually just teleporting them instead as it was seen after Crystal's apparent death, she has been transported to an unknown place where Kree scientists are experimenting on the Inhuman victims who were supposedly killed. While Lockjaw is not seen, Triton appears to be in some kind of stasis tank alongside Naja, Sterilon, and other unnamed Inhumans. Crystal is now doomed to be the next Vox.<ref name="Death of the Inhumans #4">{{cite comic|writer= Cates, Donny|penciller= Olivetti, Ariel|inker= Olivetti, Ariel|story= Chapter Four: Roar|title=Death of the Inhumans|issue= #4|date=December 2018}}</ref>

Meeting up with the Inhuman Royal Family and Beta Ray Bill, Black Bolt is told by Karnak of Vox being a program that transported his "victims" to the Kree. With the Kree planning to turn any captive Inhumans into Vox, Karnak states that not all of them will be rescued. As Black Bolt has one more scream left, Karnak tells him to make it count. Using his sign language, Black Bolt addresses the others on how he has made mistakes in the past and apologizes to them. After holding a moment of silence, Black Bolt orders Gorgon to turn around. The Inhuman ship strikes the Kree's base. Vox then pushes a button to unleash the Vox-controlled Inhumans. As Gorgon and Beta Ray Bill engage the Kree soldiers, Black Bolt, Medusa and Karnak arrive at the laboratory where they find Vox-controlled Inhumans like Crystal and Lockjaw. Using a laser, Black Bolt clears the Vox-controlled Crystal and Lockjaw just because they were in his way. Entering one door, Black Bolt signs "I love you. I'm sorry" before whispering for them to run. As Medusa and Karnak fight the Vox-controlled Crystal and Lockjaw, Black Bolt confronts other Vox-controlled Inhumans like Triton. With what little remained of his power, Black Bolt destroyed the engines responsible for transmitting the Vox program, killing all the Inhumans there and robbing the Kree of their plans. Gorgon and Beta Ray Bill arrive stating that the Kree have fled and see Crystal and Lockjaw still alive, having been freed from the Vox-control when the engines were destroyed. Black Bolt emerges from the room as Medusa orders Lockjaw to take them away from the Kree base. When Crystal asks where they should go, Black Bolt uses his sign language to say "Home." Lockjaw then teleports them away.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Cates, Donny|penciller= Olivetti, Ariel|inker= Olivetti, Ariel|story= Chapter Five: Rome|title=Death of the Inhumans|issue= #5|date=January 2019}}</ref> Beta Ray Bill would later confirm that the Royals were the last of the Inhumans, though there are still a few Inhumans active on Earth.{{Citation needed|date=February 2021}}

==Powers and abilities==
Even without using the Terrigen Mist, the Kree modifications, combined with centuries of selective breeding, have given all Inhumans certain advantages. Their average lifespan is 150 years and an Inhuman in good physical condition possesses strength, reaction time, speed, and endurance greater than the finest of human athletes. [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]] and other normal Inhumans who are in excellent physical shape can lift one ton and are physically slightly superior to the peak of normal human physical achievement. Exposure to the Terrigen Mist can both enhance and in some cases reduce these physical capabilities. Most Inhumans are used to living in a pollution-free, germ-free environment and have difficulty tolerating Earth's current level of air and water pollution for any length of time.

==Known Inhumans==
{{Main|List of Inhumans}}

===Alpha Primitives===
The '''Alpha Primitives''' are a [[Slavery|slave]] race created by the Inhumans, first appearing in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #47 (February 1966). Because of the Inhumans' low population, they created a labor force of [[hominid]]s bred to be strong, but of limited intelligence. They were also rendered unable to breed, being produced only by [[cloning]]. They were used by [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus the Mad]] in several schemes, resulting in their being freed from servitude by [[Black Bolt]]; they would no longer be cloned and those already made would be allowed to live out their lives in a preserve under the city proper. After some time though it was understood that the Alpha Primitives could not live on their own, and the previous arrangement was reversed.

The former king of the Inhumans called the [[Unspoken (comics)|Unspoken]] revealed that the Alpha Primitives are actually humans who have been exposed to gas created from Xerogen Crystals, a substance created by the [[Kree]] as a weapon for the Inhumans to use against their human enemies.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Gage, Christos; Slott, Dan|penciller= Pham, Khoi|inker= Martinez, Allen|story= The Unspoken Part 3|title= [[The Mighty Avengers]]|issue= #29|date= November 2009}}</ref>

===Bird People===
The '''Bird-People''' are a genetic offshoot of the Inhumans with bird wings, and in some cases, bat wings.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= [[Joe Simon|Simon, Joe]]|penciller= Cazeneuve, Louis|inker= Cazeneuve, Louis|story= The Origin of the Red Raven|title=Red Raven Comics|issue= #1|date= August 1940}}</ref>

===Super-Inhumans===
The Kree eventually designed a new race of Inhumans that differs greatly from the original called '''Super-Inhumans'''. They are believed to be engineered from birth with almost of all of their fellows' Inhuman abilities and none of their problematic humanity. They cannot be swayed or tricked or bought for as they want nothing but their enemies' hearts to stop beating.<ref name="DeathofInhumans1" /> The only known member of this new race is Vox and the reason is that the Super-Inhuman race is actually a ruse perpetuated by the Kree and Vox is not actually a person; instead, it is a program designed by the Kree which is then imprinted on selected Inhumans that transforms them genetically into a killing machine. When Vox is defeated or killed, another selected Inhuman would be activated and transformed into Vox.<ref name="Death of the Inhumans #4"/>

==Other versions==
===[[Earth X]]===
The Inhuman origin is retold during the prologue of Earth X and the Royal family is reimagined, with Medusa having a much bolder hairline and Blackbolt with his mouth bolted shut.

===Heroes Reborn===
{{Main|Heroes Reborn (1996 comic)}}
In this alternate reality created by [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]], the Inhumans are mostly the same. They live on Earth, in Attilan. The biggest difference is the reverence they hold, shown in statues, for [[Galactus#Heroes Reborn|Galactus]] and the multitude of heralds who operate for him simultaneously. The Terrigen Mists are not completely under their control, coming from a crack in the ground. Their ultimate origins are unknown, but Maximus the Mad escapes in the caverns deep beneath the city to locate it. Here, it is discovered their city holds connections to other areas of the world, such as [[Mole Man#Heroes Reborn|Mole Man]]'s Monster Isle.

===House of M===
{{Main|House of M}}
Black Bolt appears as an ally of [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]].<ref>{{cite book|last1= Bendis|first1= Brian Michael|last2= Coipel|first2= Olivier|title= [[House of M]]|publisher= Marvel Comics|year= 2006|page= [https://archive.org/details/houseofmxmennewa00bria/page/224 224]|isbn= 978-0785117216}}</ref> The other Inhumans were present at the meeting between Black Bolt, [[Alternative versions of Professor X#House of M|Professor X]], and Magneto.

===Squadron Supreme===
In the original [[Squadron Supreme]] universe, [[Power Princess]]'s people the Utopians are the equivalent of the Inhumans.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= [[Mark Gruenwald|Gruenwald, Mark]]|penciller= [[Bob Hall (comics)|Hall, Bob]]|inker= [[John Beatty (illustrator)|Beatty, John]]|story= The Utopia Principle|title= Squadron Supreme|issue= 1|date= September 1985}}</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
The Inhumans made their debut in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] Universe in ''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]] Annual'' #1 (2005). It begins with two mountain climbers reached the walls of their city, Atillan, in the [[Himalayas]] when they are turned back with their memories erased. The Inhumans made themselves known to the Fantastic Four when a member of their royalty, [[Crystal (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Crystal]], fled to New York after being ordered to marry [[Black Bolt#Ultimate Marvel|Black Bolt]]'s brother Maximus. Johnny came across Crystal and attempted to save her from two royal guards from Atillan who were trying to capture her. Beaten, Crystal took him back to the Baxter Building, and revealed herself to the Fantastic Four. She left behind her dog [[Lockjaw (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Lockjaw]], who had the ability to teleport the Fantastic Four to Atillan. Once their presence was discovered, the city was stripped of its advanced technology and destroyed by Black Bolt, and the Inhumans, including Crystal, relocated. They are hinted to have relocated to the Moon.<ref name="UFFA">{{cite comic| writer= [[Mark Millar|Millar, Mark]]|penciller= Lee, Jae|inker= Lee, Jae|story= The Himalayas|title= [[Ultimate Fantastic Four]] Annual|issue= #1|date= October 2005}}</ref>

The Ultimate Marvel version of Attilan is quite different in appearance from the Marvel Universe version, like a giant [[wasp]]'s nest crossed with a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[cathedral]]. Ultimate Crystal, Lockjaw, and Black Bolt are similar to their counterparts; Medusa is depicted as having actual snakes for hair, like her mythical namesake. Gorgon is female, Karnak projects energy blasts (though he can still sense weaknesses and pressure points), Triton has a more squid-like appearance, and Maximus is a somewhat effete courtier, whom Crystal describes as "preening" and a "peacock". Other Inhumans shown include Tri-clops, with [[clairvoyance|clairvoyant]] vision (including the power to see the invisible), Densitor (Maximus' flunky, who can presumably increase his strength, durability and mass, enough to become fireproof) and an unnamed Inhuman who can produce a swarm of [[insect]]-like flying creatures from his body. They claimed that their city had remained secret for 10,000 years, which makes their ancestors contemporaries with Ultimate Marvel's Atlantis.<ref name="UFFA" />

===Amalgam Comics===
The [[X-Patrol|Un-People]] are a superhero group in the [[Amalgam Comics]] universe. They are a combination of [[DC Comics]]' [[Forever People]] and Marvel Comics' Inhumans.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Karl Kesel|Kesel, Karl]]|penciller= [[Tom Grummett|Grummett, Tom]]|inker= Vey, Al|story= Challengers of the Fantastic|title= [[List of Amalgam Comics characters|Challengers of the Fantastic]]|issue= #1|date= June 1997}}</ref>

===''Inhumans 2099''===
In the 2004 [[Marvel Knights]] ''Inhumans 2099'' one-shot written by [[Robert Kirkman]], which took place in the future on an alternate world (Earth-2992) that was not identical to the alternate Marvel Universe on Earth-928 featured in the 1990s [[Marvel 2099]] books, the Inhumans leave Earth's moon and are forced to live aboard a spaceship after the Mutant Registration Act is passed. After leaving, Black Bolt places himself and his closest confidants ([[Triton (comics)|Triton]], [[Gorgon (Inhuman)|Gorgon]], [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]], [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]], and [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]]) in cryogenic stasis and, in his absence, his brother [[Maximus (comics)#Marvel Knights 2099|Maximus]] takes over as leader of the Inhumans living aboard the spacecraft. While in control, Maximus kills Black Bolt's confidants in their sleep. Fifty years later, Black Bolt is released from cryogenic stasis to find that Maximus has killed those closest to him. In retaliation, he breaks his vow of silence and destroys the Inhumans' spacecraft, killing all aboard, including himself.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Robert Kirkman|Kirkman, Robert]]|penciller= Rathburn, Cliff|inker= Rathburn, Cliff|title= Inhumans 2099|issue= #1|date= November 2004}}</ref>

===Inhumans ([[Earth X|Earth-9997]])===
In this reality Attilan was returned to the Himalayan mountains at some point until the population grew tired of living in seclusion and decided to leave the Great Refuge to forge new destinies among humanity. This happened at a time when Maximus was once more vying for power and had built a bomb that - once detonated - would release the Terrigen Mists into the Earth's atmosphere. The Inhuman Royal Family managed to stop him from doing so with Medusa killing him in the process. With no kingdom to rule over, the Inhuman Royal Family decided to travel to the stars and find their fate elsewhere in the universe. However, Black Bolt felt that his people would be persecuted and demonized by humanity, much like they treat mutants on the outside world, so he decided to unleash the Terrigen Mist bomb filling Earth's atmosphere with the gas. This was unknown to all, including the Watcher, whom Black Bolt had blinded to prevent him from seeing. It has been suggested that Black Bolt had some intimate knowledge about the Celestials' plans for the Earth, and releasing the Terrigen Mists on the Earth was a way to set plans in motion to stop the Celestial birth in Earth's core.<ref>{{cite book|last1= Ross|first1= Alex|author-link1= Alex Ross|last2= Krueger|first2= Jim|author-link2= Jim Krueger|title= Earth X|publisher= Marvel Comics|date= 2001|location= New York City|pages= 575|isbn= 978-0936211671|quote= Collects ''Earth X'' #0–12 and #X}}</ref>

===Animation===
* The Inhumans made their animation debut in the 1978 ''[[Fantastic Four (1978 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' episode "Medusa and the Inhumans". In this continuity, Medusa is the leader instead of Black Bolt, though he does make a brief appearance as an unnamed Inhuman. Medusa wants to take over the human race from her Himalayan base, and brainwashes the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] into attacking HERBIE and the Fantastic Four until the former causes him to trip and regain his memories. As they escape, Gorgon creates an earthquake, but [[Reed Richards]] puts him on a hanger so he cannot use his seismic powers. Karnak attacks their ship, but [[Invisible Woman|Sue Storm]] makes his arm invisible, causing him to run off in panic. The Fantastic Four are eventually confronted by Medusa and show her a projection showing the banality of human life. The Inhumans decide it is not worth conquering the humans and let the Fantastic Four free.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://marvel.toonzone.net/ff1978/episode/medusainhumans/ | title= Medusa and the Inhumans | publisher= Marvel Animmation Age|date= October 7, 1978|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130618135347/http://marvel.toonzone.net/ff1978/episode/medusainhumans/|archive-date=June 18, 2013 |url-status= live|access-date= October 19, 2010}}</ref>
* The Inhumans appear in the 1994 ''[[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' series, first appearing in the three-part season two episode "Inhumans Saga" before becoming a sub-plot for the rest of the season. Their creation at the hands of the Kree remains intact in this series.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://marvel.toonzone.net/fanfourtas/guide/|title= Fantastic Four Episode Guide|publisher= Marvel Animation Age|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130618125929/http://marvel.toonzone.net/fanfourtas/guide/|archive-date=June 18, 2013 |url-status= live}}</ref> After Maximus erases her memory, an amnesiac Medusa teams up with the [[Frightful Four]] to brainwash the Thing into killing the Fantastic Four. However, Gorgon rescues Medusa. Following this, [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]] finds Crystal, Karnak, and [[Lockjaw (comics)|Lockjaw]] and brings his team to face off with the Inhumans. Black Bolt soon arrives and overpowers the Thing, but is weakened by Earth's atmosphere. The [[Seeker (comics)|Seeker]] kidnaps Triton and uses him to lure in the Inhumans, vowing to kill Triton unless Medusa marries him. Reed Richards tracks down Attilan and helps the royal family regain the throne. In a last ditch attempt, Maximus creates an impenetrable force field around Attilan, though the Fantastic Four escape.
* The Inhumans appear in ''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]'' In the episode "Inhuman Nature", [[Rick Jones (character)|A-Bomb]] falls in love with Crystal, but both are teleported away by Lockjaw and Triton. The agents of S.M.A.S.H. follow them to a secret Himalayan base, where Maximus has been manipulating the royal family into believing humans are evil, but Hulk convinces them that humans and Inhumans have a lot to learn from each other. Black Bolt decides to open the shield hiding the base, but Maximus causes it to stay up permanently. Black Bolt shatters the shield with a single word and Crystal and A-Bomb are reunited. In "Planet Monster" Pt. 2, Black Bolt, Gorgon, and Lockjaw help the agents of S.M.A.S.H. and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], among other heroes, fight the [[Supreme Intelligence]]'s forces.
* The Inhumans appear in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]''. In the episode "Inhumanity", [[Spider-Man]] and Triton are forced to work together when Maximus incites a war between [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and the Inhumans after brainwashing the royal family. Eventually, Maximus is defeated, Black Bolt prevents Manhattan from being destroyed, and Triton becomes an ambassador to S.H.I.E.L.D. In "Agent Web", Spider-Man and Triton head to the abandoned Inhuman city of Atarog to rescue [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]] and [[Julia Carpenter|Madame Web]] from [[Crossbones (character)|Crossbones]] and his [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] forces.
* The Inhumans and the Alpha Primitives appear in the ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (TV series)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' episode "Crystal Blue Persuasion". The [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|titular team]] end up on Attilan after Lockjaw brings them there to assist in stopping a "Terrigen Plague" that has been spreading throughout the city. Maximus seemingly creates a cure, but brainwashes Black Bolt via a mind control helmet and swears the Inhumans' allegiance to the Kree when [[Ronan the Accuser]] arrives as part of a deal they had previously made. However, Ronan reneges and proceeds to destroy Attilan as well as confiscate Maximus' helmet so he can have Black Bolt order Lockjaw to teleport him and [[Star-Lord]] to the caverns beneath Attilan to destroy it from below. Star-Lord successfully cures the Terrigen Plague and frees Black Bolt, allowing the latter to cripple Ronan's ship.
* The Inhumans appear in ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]''. In the episode "Inhumans Among Us", an Inhuman ship carrying Seeker and the Alpha Primitives crashes. The Avengers respond to the distress call, where they have a brief fight with Black Bolt, Medusa, Gorgon, and Karnak until [[Inferno (Dante Pertuz)|Inferno]] hatches from a Terrigen cocoon nearby, forcing the Avengers and royal family to join forces to fight the newly created Inhuman. Unbeknownst to both parties, Seeker staged the incident as part of a collaboration with [[Ultron]]. In "The Inhuman Condition", Ultron invades Attilan and captures all of its Inhumans except for Black Bolt, Lockjaw, and Seeker. The Avengers come to aid them, whereupon Seeker reveals he has been working on a device to disperse Terrigen Mist throughout Earth and create more Inhumans. However, Ultron created a larger version to exterminate mankind. Once Attilan's inhabitants have been rescued, [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] throws a Terrigen Crystal into the device, thwarting Ultron's plans and creating more Inhumans. In the four-part episode "Civil War", Ultron disguises himself as politician Truman Marsh and establishes the [[Registration Acts (comics)|Inhuman Registration Act]] to place "registration disks" on Inhumans so he can control them as part of his new plan to destroy mankind. However, the Avengers and [[Mighty Avengers]] discover his plot and free the Inhumans.
* The Inhumans feature prominently in the second season of ''[[Marvel Future Avengers]]''. During the show's events, an outbreak of Terrigen Mist on Earth causes several humans to develop newfound powers, with the Avengers and Future Avengers working to determine the cause of the outbreak while attempting to prevent Earth from going to war with the Inhumans.
* A [[Marvel Animation]] motion comic DVD was released on April 23, 2013 based on Paul Jenkins and Jae Lee's ''Inhumans'' vol. 2 #1–12<ref>{{cite web|title= Shout!

====Television====
[[File:Inhumans TV series cast.jpg|thumb|right|The Inhuman Royal Family from the TV show ''[[Inhumans (TV series)|Inhumans]]''.]]
*The Inhumans make their live-action debut in media set within the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU).
**They are introduced in the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 2)|second season]] of ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', with further development in the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 3)|third season]]. In this continuity, the Kree's experiments with the Inhumans date back to the [[Maya civilization]] when a Mayan hunter was turned into [[Hive (comics)|Hive]].
***The Alpha Primitives appeared in the show's third season, though they are referred to simply as "Primitives". This version of the Primitives are the result of Hive and [[Holden Radcliffe]]'s failed experiments to turn humans into Inhumans through a pathogen created from a combination of Terrigen Crystals, the blood of [[Daisy Johnson]] and a Kree Reaper, and Hive's own parasitic organism. While the Primitives have enhanced strength and infrared sensory capabilities, they also retain the skills they had before their transformation.
**An eight-episode live-action television series, titled ''[[Inhumans (TV series)|Marvel's Inhumans]]'', premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] after the first two episodes were screened in [[IMAX]] theaters for two weeks beginning on September 1, 2017.<ref name="InhumansAnnouncement" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/why-abcs-deal-bring-marvels-inhumans-imax-is-a-quadrupal-win-949027 |title=Why ABC's Deal to Bring Marvel's 'The Inhumans' to Imax Is a "Quadruple Win" |last=Goldberg |first=Lesley |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=November 21, 2016 |access-date=November 22, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122013616/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/why-abcs-deal-bring-marvels-inhumans-imax-is-a-quadrupal-win-949027 |archive-date=November 22, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite tweet|author=IMAX Corporation|author-link=IMAX Corporation|user=IMAX|number=837762369107419136|title=The full cast is set for @Marvel's #Inhumans, premiering exclusively in IMAX theatres September 1!|date=March 3, 2017|access-date=March 4, 2017|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6oiVpTCmA?url=https://twitter.com/IMAX/status/837762369107419136|archive-date=March 4, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> IMAX is also a financial partner for ''Inhumans'', and this was the first time a television series premiered in IMAX.

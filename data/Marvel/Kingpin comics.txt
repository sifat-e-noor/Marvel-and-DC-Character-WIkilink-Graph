The '''Kingpin''' ('''Wilson Grant Fisk''') is a <!--Do not add "fictional" as it is tautological; supervillains (and characters in general) are by definition implied to be fictionalized to some extent.-->[[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[John Romita Sr.]], and first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #50 ([[cover-date]]d [[1967 in comics#July|July 1967]]).<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=206}}</ref> The "Kingpin" name is a reference to the crime lord title in [[Mafia]] slang nomenclature.

One of the most feared, dangerous and powerful crime lords in the [[Marvel Universe]], usually depicted as [[New York City]]'s [[Crime boss|crime overlord]], he was introduced as an [[List of Spider-Man enemies|adversary]] of [[Spider-Man]], but later went on to be the [[archenemy]] of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]],<ref name="top 5 enemies of Daredevil">Furious, Nick (January 25, 2011). [http://www.comicbooked.com/top-5-enemies-of-daredevil "The Top 5 Enemies of Daredevil"]. comicbooked.com</ref> as well as a recurring foe of the [[Punisher]] and his adoptive daughter [[Echo (Marvel Comics)|Echo]]. The Kingpin is the husband of [[Vanessa Fisk]] and the father of [[Richard Fisk]]. His traditional attire consists of his signature white suit jacket and cane, though his appearance has been changed over the years. Across all iterations, the Kingpin is depicted with an extraordinarily heavyset appearance and a bald head. The character is not simply [[obese]] but also heavily-muscled (like a [[sumo wrestler]]) and a formidable hand-to-hand combatant. While this makes him a dangerous foe to face in person, even to Spider-Man, his size has been regularly mocked.

The character has been substantially adapted from the comics into various forms of media, including films, television series and video games. He has been portrayed by [[John Rhys-Davies]] in the 1989 film ''[[The Trial of the Incredible Hulk]]'' and by [[Michael Clarke Duncan]] in the 2003 film ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]].'' [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] portrays the character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) franchise, having appeared thus far in the television series ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'' (2015-2018) and ''[[Hawkeye (2021 TV series)|Hawkeye]]'' (2021), while being scheduled to reprise the role in ''[[Echo (TV series)|Echo]]'' (2023) and ''[[Daredevil: Born Again]]'' (2024). Michael Clarke Duncan additionally voiced the character in the 2003 animated series ''[[Spider-Man: The New Animated Series]],'' while [[Liev Schreiber]] voiced him in the animated film ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]'' (2018). In 2009, the Kingpin was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 10th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kingpin is Number 10|url=https://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-villains/10.html|access-date=2015-04-20|publisher=[[IGN]]}}</ref>

==Publication history==
The Kingpin first appears in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #50 (July 1967), and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[John Romita Sr.]],<ref>{{cite book|last1 = Manning|first1 = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 40|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= Although he made his debut in the previous issue, it was in this [Stan] Lee and [John] Romita tale [''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #51] that the Kingpin – real name Wilson Fisk – really left his mark on organized crime.}}</ref> who based his physical appearance on actors [[Sydney Greenstreet]]<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cowsill|first1=Alan|title=Spider-Man Chronicle: A Year by Year Visual History|date=October 1, 2012|publisher=Dk Pub|isbn=9780756692360}}</ref> and [[Robert Middleton]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wells |first1=John |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1965-1969 |date=2014 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490557 |page=185}}</ref>

In his debut [[story arc]] in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #50–52, the Kingpin is portrayed purely as a crime lord, albeit one who tends to be unusually hands-on in his criminal dealings.<ref name="Comtois30">{{cite book|last=Comtois|first=Pierre|title=Marvel Comics in the 80s: An Issue by Issue Field Guide to a Pop Culture Phenomenon|date=December 2014|publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing|page=30}}</ref> In his subsequent appearances, also written by Lee, he becomes more of a typical supervillain, employing fantastic devices to further his criminal capers.<ref name="Comtois30"/> In the early 1980s, the character evolved further. A series of appearances in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' by writer/penciler [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] depicted the Kingpin as a scheming, cold-blooded crime lord who consistently stayed beyond the reach of the law. This remained the character's dominant form for decades<ref name="Comtois30"/> as the Kingpin became widely regarded as Daredevil's [[archenemy]].<ref name="top 5 enemies of Daredevil"/> He continues to be a recurring opponent of [[Spider-Man]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Echo (Marvel Comics)|Echo]], and the [[Punisher]].

==Fictional character biography==
Wilson Grant Fisk began his life as a poor child in [[New York City]], bullied by his classmates due to his obesity. Fisk began training himself in physical combat, using his new-found strength to form a gang of his former tormentors that terrorized the surrounding neighborhoods. He was eventually discovered by mob boss Don Rigoletto, who hired him and his best friend as bodyguards, and Fisk worked his way up until he became Rigoletto's right-hand man. He then turned on his mentor, eliminating him and taking control of his men and business interests, before expanding his new empire until he had become one of the most powerful figures in New York's criminal underworld, earning the name "Kingpin".<ref>''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #-1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

While the Kingpin enjoyed a long tenure in his new position, he also garnered enemies in the form of the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] and the terrorist group [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]]. The two groups joined forces to attack Fisk's empire, causing him to flee to [[Japan]] after losing most of his assets. There, he started a legitimate [[spice]] exporting business and used the profits to return to New York, organizing his old followers and starting a war to destroy the Maggia. The resulting chaos allowed Fisk to easily step back in and gain back everything he had lost.<ref name="50-52" />

Fisk attempted to form a coalition of New York's crime families after hearing that the vigilante [[Spider-Man]] had disappeared and ordered the abduction of [[J. Jonah Jameson]] to silence his reporting on the Kingpin's crimes, but Spider-Man returned and foiled his plans, in what became Fisk's first confrontation with the web-slinger.<ref name="50-52">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #50-52. Marvel Comics.</ref>

To avoid public scrutiny of his criminal activities, Fisk cultivated an image of himself as a legitimate businessman and a kind-hearted philanthropist who made donations to [[charitable organization|charities]]. He eventually met and then married a woman named [[Vanessa Fisk|Vanessa]], with whom he had a son named [[Richard Fisk|Richard]]. Vanessa did not know that her future husband was a criminal when they married. When she finally learned who he really was, she threatened to leave him if he did not give up his life of crime. The Kingpin gave up his criminal empire, moving his family to Japan to protect them from his enemies. As time passed, however, he found himself unable to adjust to civilian life and became the Kingpin once more, this time with his wife's knowledge.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 1 #170–171. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Richard did not find out that his father was a criminal until he attended [[college]]. After graduating, he told his parents that he intended to travel through [[Europe]]. Only months later, they received news that their son had died in a [[ski]]ing accident. However, it turned out that Richard was still alive; he returned to New York, used a costume and mask to disguise himself as a mysterious new crime lord calling himself the "Schemer", and formed his own gang to destroy his father's empire. Fisk came back into conflict with Spider-Man as he worked to stop the Schemer.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #83–85. Marvel Comics.</ref>

At one point, he became the manager and director of a Las Vegas-based fragment of HYDRA despite their past opposition to his rule.<ref name="Captain America' 1972">''Captain America'' #147-148 (March–April 1972). Marvel Comics.</ref>

At his wife's behest, Fisk later permanently divested himself of his criminal empire. He unsuccessfully attempted to kill Spider-Man once more before stepping down as the Kingpin, swearing to never again return to crime.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #196–197 (October 1979). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===1980s===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Daredevil cover - number 170.jpg|thumbnail|right|240px|Cover to ''Daredevil'' #170, the Kingpin's first appearance in the title. Art by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]].]] -->
To complete his reformation, the Kingpin agreed to turn over all of his records to the authorities so they could prosecute his former lieutenants. His wife Vanessa was subsequently kidnapped by the men he betrayed, who then put out a contract on his life. After witnessing Vanessa's apparent death, Fisk returned to a life of crime. He quickly regained control by taking advantage of his knowledge of the weaknesses of all of New York's criminal organizations, and made a promise to keep the East Coast stable to stop crime bosses from the Midwest from expanding into his territory. The Kingpin also gained the loyalty of infamous assassin [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] by promising him steady work. When [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] stole his records, the Kingpin did nothing to stop him, plotting to get his old allies arrested so he could select more compliant replacements. Daredevil realized this in time to stop himself from turning over the records, frustrating the Kingpin's plans.<ref>''Daredevil'' #170–172 (May–June 1981). Marvel Comics</ref> Kingpin maneuvered Daredevil into battling the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]], hoping to get him killed.<ref>''Daredevil'' #174–175 (September–October 1981). Marvel Comics.</ref> He secretly promoted corrupt mayoral candidate Randolph Cherryh, and hired the services of [[Elektra (character)|Elektra Natchios]]. Daredevil found Vanessa alive but amnesiac, and used her as leverage to force Kingpin to end his support for Cherryh. As retribution, he sent Elektra to kill [[Foggy Nelson]] (Daredevil's friend), but Elektra failed and was killed by Bullseye.<ref>''Daredevil'' #177–178 and #180–181. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Kingpin learned Daredevil's secret identity through information passed on from [[Karen Page]], Daredevil's ex-girlfriend who was now a pornographic film actress addicted to drugs. The Kingpin used his influence to [[Daredevil: Born Again|destroy]] Matt Murdock's civilian and professional life. Enamored with the results of his own scheme, he became increasingly obsessed with ruining Daredevil's legacy. This led to a series of events that included brutalizing respected crime reporter [[Ben Urich]], having his employees [[James Wesley (comics)|James Wesley]] and [[Felix Manning]] assault Daredevil's confidant, dirty cop [[Nick Manolis]], and sending the homicidal [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Nuke]] into Hell's Kitchen. Nuke's rampage killed dozens of people, and the Kingpin was implicated. Though he avoided prison, his reputation was shattered and the image of respectability he had carefully built was ruined.<ref name="Born Again">[[Daredevil: Born Again|''Daredevil: Born Again'' / ''Daredevil'']] #227–233 (February–August 1986). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Kingpin was sought out by the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] (who was dating Spider-Man at the time), and became concerned that her lack of powers would make the woman a liability to him. He therefore arranged to have scientists on his payroll provide her with defensive "bad luck" powers that cause mishap to befall anyone who attempts to harm her in combat but also hurt and eventually kill anyone who stays close to her for too long. The Kingpin hoped that this would lead to Spider-Man's death, but Spider-Man and the Black Cat ultimately broke up instead. Shortly after, Fisk was attacked by Spider-Man.<ref>''Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #100 (March 1985). Marvel Comics.</ref> Fisk later had his scientists create the supervillains the [[Answer (comics)|Answer]],<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #92. Marvel Comics.</ref> and the [[Spot (comics)|Spot]],<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #98. Marvel Comics.</ref> to battle Spider-Man and the Black Cat so they would not interfere further with his operations.

===1990s===
Fisk later rehires Bullseye to look into the parties responsible for a major drug war in New York and survives an assassination attempt by [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]]. In retaliation, he sends Bullseye to assassinate the [[Red Skull]] (Crossbones's employer). The attempt fails, and the Kingpin instead defeats the Red Skull (in a clone of Captain America's body) in personal combat.<ref>''Captain America'' #373 and #376–378 (1990). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Fisk subsequently purchases his own cable television station, partnering with a wealthy millionaire from [[Texas]] that the Kingpin thinks can be easily manipulated. However, the "millionaire" is actually a spy planted by HYDRA. Learning of this from [[Nick Fury]], Daredevil spreads rumors among New York's criminal outfits that the Kingpin had become a stooge of HYDRA, weakening his credibility and influence. HYDRA operatives steal most of the Kingpin's fortune, deprive him of income by dismantling his businesses, and send a helicopter gunship to destroy his skyscraper offices. With his empire crumbling, the Kingpin is indicted on federal charges, and Daredevil tricks him into committing assault and battery when he tries to escape via Manhattan's [[Port Authority Bus Terminal]]. Bailed out of jail by a rival, Fisk finally snaps when he learns that his benefactor intends to use him as an "errand boy". He kills him, and becomes a fugitive.<ref>''Daredevil'' #297–300. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Kingpin regains his sanity and has a small role in ''[[DC vs. Marvel|Marvel vs. DC]]'' when he purchases the ''[[Daily Planet]]'', firing [[Perry White]] and replacing him with [[J. Jonah Jameson]]. He also bullies workers, especially [[Lois Lane]], who threatens to expose him as the Kingpin. Eventually, he is confronted by his angry staff but is defeated when Spider-Man ([[Ben Reilly]]) and [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] arrive before he can do any significant damage.  At the end of the crossover, the universes are restored and the Kingpin is returned home.

Fisk returns to Japan and focuses on rebuilding his empire while fighting the [[X-Men]] and [[Shang-Chi]], Kingpin became leader of [[Zheng Zu|Shang-Chi's fathe]]<nowiki/>r's organization, [[Five Weapons Society|Si-Fan]], introducing a clan of [[cyborg]] [[ninjas]] named Cyber-Ninjas.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |title=Celestial Order of the Si-Fan |url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/sifanorder.htm |access-date=2022-05-21 |website=The Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe}}</ref><ref>''X-Men'' #62 (March 1997).

===2000s===
While in Japan, Fisk manipulates his adoptive daughter Maya Lopez ([[Echo (Marvel Comics)|Echo]]) into thinking that Daredevil killed her biological father (although Fisk was actually responsible) to incite Daredevil's death.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #10 (May 2000). Marvel Comics.</ref> However, his plan backfires when Daredevil convinces Maya of the truth, and Lopez shoots the Kingpin in the eyes in retaliation, rendering him blind.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #15 (April 2001). Marvel Comics.</ref> Fisk eventually loses his criminal empire to [[Samuel Silke]] (one of his employees who works with Richard) in a bloody assassination bid, using the Kingpin's new status as a blind man to rally supporters.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #30. Marvel Comics.</ref> In the aftermath, Vanessa kills Richard and flees the country with Fisk's remaining wealth while the Kingpin recuperates in an unnamed East European country, broken and alone. He is given an eye transplant which restores his eyesight.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #46. Marvel Comics.</ref> He eventually confronts Silke and fatally crushes the man's head, almost manages to regain his empire through sheer will, but is defeated by Daredevil (who declares himself the new Kingpin). Fisk is imprisoned as a result.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #50 (October 2003). Marvel Comics.</ref>

He later hatches a scheme to be freed and regain his wealth by giving the FBI proof in the form of the nonexistent "Murdock Papers" that Murdock is Daredevil. Having made so many enemies in prison, Fisk is constantly under attack from the Hand, HYDRA, and any number of criminal organizations with which he had had dealings. The U.S. government is hard-pressed to get rid of this expensive, dangerous, legally clean master criminal, and Fisk succeeds in manipulating the FBI into gravely wounding Daredevil and providing them a sample of Daredevil's DNA.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #77–78 (November–December [[2005 in comics|2005]]). Marvel Comics.</ref> He tells Ben Urich to give the federal government the location of the [[Night Nurse (comics)|Night Nurse]], the only medic for injured superheroes, or go to jail.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #79–81 (January–March [[2006 in comics|2006]]). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Kingpin finally succeeds in getting Matt Murdock arrested, but the FBI betrays him at the last minute and arrests him as well, placing him in the same jail as Murdock in the hopes that the two will kill each other;<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #82–85 (April–July [[2006 in comics|2006]]). Marvel Comics.</ref> instead, the two enemies team up to survive a prison riot directed at them. Finally, Murdock sacrifices the deal, refusing to let Bullseye (who was also incarcerated) leave the prison as the Kingpin had planned. The fight ends with the Kingpin shot point-blank in the knee by gunfire from Bullseye intended for Murdock, while Murdock escapes; a dying Vanessa is revealed to have manipulated events to attempt to have them both killed, while mourning her son's death.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #86–87 (August–September [[2006 in comics|2006]]). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Fisk appears in the 2006 ''[[Civil War (comics)#Civil War|Civil War: War Crimes]]'' one-shot issue, in which he offers information about [[Captain America]]'s Resistance base to [[Iron Man]], the leader of the [[2006 Superhuman Registration Act|pro-Registration]] forces in exchange for a reduced sentence. But as his status in prison is threatened for collaborating with Iron Man, he betrays Iron Man.<ref>''[[Civil War (comics)#Civil War|Civil War: War Crimes]]'' (May [[2007 in comics|2007]]) Marvel Comics.</ref> He then puts out a hit on Spider-Man's loved ones after Iron Man convinced Peter Parker to publicly reveal himself as a means of demonstrating support for the Superhuman Registration Act. This results in [[Aunt May|May Parker]] being gravely wounded by a sniper's attempt to kill Spider-Man. After tracing the event back to Kingpin, Spider-Man confronts the Kingpin in prison and badly beats him in front of his fellow inmates. Spider-Man decides to let the Kingpin live with the humiliation of his defeat, news of which will quickly spread through the Underworld. Parker vows, however, to kill the Kingpin if May dies.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #538-542 (May–August 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Murdock returns to the United States with a cleared name and completes Vanessa's last wish and takes on Fisk's case, getting all charges dropped in exchange for Fisk leaving the country, giving up his American citizenship and his agreement to end his vendetta with Daredevil. Although the charges were dropped due to the evidence being deemed inadmissible in court, Murdock delays the case enough so Fisk is unable to attend his wife's funeral. The mournful Fisk is later seen visiting his wife's grave, before temporarily returning to New York to resolve some loose ends.<ref name=deadendkids>''Runaways'' vol. 2 #25–30. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In a 2007–2008 storyline in the series ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]'', Fisk meets with the Runaways, revealing he knew all about their [[Pride (comics)|parents]] since they ruled [[Los Angeles]] with efficiency and vision; he never tried to take their territory, nor did they invade his. He makes a deal with the Runaways to secure a mysterious object for him in exchange for protection from the government. He and his army of ninjas are defeated when the Runaways refuse to give it to him after stealing the object, discovering what Fisk wanted was a device invented by the [[Pride (comics)|Pride]]. It is later revealed that Fisk was hired by elderly woman Lillie McGurty who orchestrated the events so the Runaways can travel back to 1907 and ensure that the woman would come back to the present with them, which her past self declined.<ref name=deadendkids/>

In the 2007 "[[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]]" storyline, which ends with the undoing from history of Peter and [[Mary Jane Watson]]'s marriage and Spider-Man's real identity public revelation, all memories on the part of the public that Spider-Man is Peter is removed, including the Kingpin's.<ref>''[[Spider-Man: One More Day]]'' (November [[2007 in comics|2007]]–January [[2008 in comics|2008]]) [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

During the 2008 "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" storyline, the Kingpin forms an alliance with [[Lady Bullseye]] to destroy Daredevil. He orders Lady Bullseye to disguise herself as a member of the Hand and kill two corrupt cops and a judge, making it seems that Daredevil ordered this and prompting [[Norman Osborn]] as the leader of the law enforcement organization [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] to send Bullseye in retaliation. Though Daredevil survives the fight with Bullseye, the Kingpin is undeterred and states that he has Daredevil "where he wants [his nemesis]".<ref>''Dark Reign: The List – Daredevil'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Kingpin has also targeted Daredevil's friends to frame Osborn for their recent misfortunes to further his attempts on manipulating Daredevil's actions. He has Nelson disbarred as an attorney for standing up to a judge on his payroll for an unfair ruling of overturning a jury's verdict. He also causes the loss of [[Dakota North (comics)|Dakota North]]'s private investigator license.<ref>''Daredevil'' #502–504. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the 2009 ''Daredevil'' arc "[[Return of the King (comics)|Return of the King]]", it is revealed that the Kingpin has spent the past year living a normal life in a small Spanish fishing village. There he meets and falls in love with Marta, a young mother of two. He finds himself trying to overcome his former life as a crime lord, only to later find Marta and the two kids murdered by Lady Bullseye and the Hand who then brutally attack him, stabbing him through the shoulders with two katanas. When he asks why, Lady Bullseye replies, "The reasons are far too numerous, but if you want a specific cause, ask Daredevil".<ref>''Daredevil'' #116. Marvel Comics.</ref> In his revenge against the Hand, the Kingpin frees and recruits the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]] to help him. Fisk begins experiencing hallucinations of his dead wife who taunts him. It turns out that Fisk's actual plan is to take the leadership of the Hand, after killing Hiroshi, the ninja-lord who ordered the family's assassinations. However, he is thwarted by Daredevil who takes the lead for himself.<ref>''Daredevil'' #118–119 and #500. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===2010s===
During the 2010 "[[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]]" storyline, the Kingpin approaches [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] and [[Luke Cage]], telling the two that they will need to take down Daredevil soon. The Kingpin and Lady Bullseye later perform a ritual that brings back [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]] to attack the Hand.<ref>''Shadowland'' #2.

Marvel Comics.</ref> Like all other New Yorkers, he lost those powers when the situation was resolved.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #672 (October 26, 2011). Marvel Comics.</ref>

====''Marvel NOW!''====
As part of the 2012 ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' initiative, the Kingpin hears about how [[Doctor Octopus|Otto Octavius]] as the [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] has been using brutal methods to take down the local crime families, which would leave a vacuum to fill. The Kingpin's Shadowland hideout is attacked by the Superior Spider-Man to which the Kingpin claims that the Superior Spider-Man is much different than the nemesis he had fought. While escaping, the Kingpin kills his doppelgänger Smedley Kornfeld (who was hired for events like this) to fool the Superior Spider-Man.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>

With his power over New York gone, Fisk set up shop in San Francisco, with the intention of rebuilding his empire there. But the vigilante [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]] acted first, taking control of the local gangs and kidnapped the Owl who also relocated to San Francisco. He transformed Owlsley into a super-computer capable of taking control of all wifi signals to locate his former girlfriend [[Julia Carpenter]]. During this time, Daredevil confirmed his secret identity, taking a positive approach to it this time and moved to San Francisco to practice law and continue his superhero career. Fisk began to make moves against both of his enemies, hiring the assassin Ikari to kidnap Foggy and Matt's new girlfriend, Kirsten McDuffie, and having his men look for Julia to have leverage against the Shroud. However, the Shroud and Daredevil came into conflict when he and Jubua Pride, the Owl's daughter, attempted to free Owlsley. The Shroud then released all private information about Daredevil's law practice's clients. Daredevil went to Fisk and offered him a deal, he would use his resources to fix his situation and assure Foggy and Kirsten are safe, and in exchange Matt Murdock would fake his death and get a new identity only Fisk would know, giving Kingpin back the power to destroy Daredevil, which he lost when he went public. However, Fisk went with his original plan instead and Ikari kidnapped Nelson and Kirsten. Meanwhile, the Shroud, Pride, and Daredevil crashed when they attempted to get Julia at an airport, allowing Kingpin's goons to take her. Fisk presented his hostages when Daredevil confronted him and had him fight Ikari to the death, with Fisk killing one of them if Daredevil wins. The fight took them to the streets, where the Shroud saved Daredevil and killed Ikari. Improvising, Daredevil took Ikari's costume and claimed to have killed the hero while the Shroud had the Owl bring to light all of Fisk's operations in exchange for his freedom. While Kingpin and Daredevil fought, the federals stormed his building. Daredevil beat down the Kingpin when he tried to flee and rescued the hostages, leaving him in bankruptcy.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 4 #15-18. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the 2015 "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline, the Kingpin hosts a viewing party for the incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610 where his guests include [[Absorbing Man]], Bullseye, Norman Osborn, [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], and [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]].

Marvel Comics.</ref>

====Mayor of New York City====
After HYDRA's defeat, Wilson Fisk is able to use a subsequent election to put himself forward as a last-minute candidate to become the [[Mayor of New York City]], avoiding his criminal past being drawn into the issue by simply ignoring questions about it, aided by the fact that he has never been legitimately charged with anything. With his primary policy being a bill to declare all vigilantes as criminals, and despite Daredevil's own recent efforts to create a precedent for superheroes testifying under their secret identities in Washington, he is able to have Daredevil arrested in an FBI sting operation, mocking his old nemesis with the knowledge that the people he protects chose Fisk to 'protect' ''them'', prompting Daredevil to break a window and leap out of Fisk's office to begin his own efforts to bring down Fisk's empire. Matt Murdock then applied for the position of deputy mayor.<ref>''Daredevil'' #595. Marvel Comics.</ref> Although Daredevil eventually attempts to set up a 'sting operation' where he and his fellow street-level heroes will capture Mayor Fisk meeting with various gang bosses, Mayor Fisk uses this plan against them and uses the opportunity to arrest all of Daredevil's allies, subsequently attempting to provoke Daredevil into attacking him. Although Mayor Fisk is able to arrest Daredevil as well, he is subsequently attacked and left in critical condition by the Hand, with various amendments made to New York's constitution by prior administrations putting Matt Murdock in control of the city,<ref>''Daredevil'' #600. Marvel Comics.</ref> once he has escaped from captivity, thanks to the Hand attacking the police van where he was being held, Fisk in critical condition and nobody willing to challenge the legal situation.<ref>''Daredevil'' #601. Marvel Comics.</ref> While Matt Murdock used his skills as Daredevil and the acting mayor to keep the city safe with the street-level superheroes fighting off the Hand, Fisk recovered. Murdock gave Fisk the position of mayor back to him where Fisk had to promise not to do anymore crusades against the vigilantes.<ref>''Daredevil'' #605. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Mayor Wilson Fisk later adopts another daughter, named Princess Fisk, who he briefly sends to go to P.S. 20 Anna Silver, the same elementary school as [[Moon Girl (Marvel Comics)|Lunella "Moon Girl" Lafayette]].<ref>''[[Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur]]'' (June October [[2018 in comics|2018]]) [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

Mayor Wilson Fisk later had an encounter with Kindred ([[Harry Osborn]]). This demon kills Fisk's associates using supernatural abilities and forces him to back off of Peter Parker after revealing that he is in possession of Vanessa Fisk's soul.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Operatives of Mayor Wilson Fisk free Electro (Francine Frye) so that she can be part of a female version of the Sinister Syndicate. When the Sinister Syndicate is formed, Mayor Fisk gives them their first mission to capture Boomerang who has stolen something from him. When the Sinister Syndicate catches Boomerang, Beetle contacts Mayor Fisk as she is given information on where the exchange should happen. As the Sinister Syndicate plans to adjourn for the night, they hear Mayor Fisk outside stating that they are harboring a criminal and are to surrender Boomerang to him or suffer the full might of New York City. The Syndicate notices the police, the SWAT Team, the Anti-Super Squad, and low-level bureaucrats. Spider-Man arrives as well and tries to get Mayor Fisk to have the authorities stand down only for Mayor Fisk to claim that Spider-Man fell prey to Boomerang's hypnotic boomerang. Electro claims that Spider-Man is buying them some time. After reading the paper in Boomerang's hand that belonged to Mayor Fisk, Beetle tells the Syndicate that they should let Boomerang go. While Beetle claimed that she betrayed them, she did it because she is a supervillain and states that she plans to have Mayor Fisk deputize them. The rest of the Syndicate is not up with this plan. The Syndicate then assists Spider-Man against Mayor Fisk's forces. Beetle has Spider-Man evacuate Boomerang while the Syndicate fights Mayor Fisk's forces while not killing them. The Syndicate is defeated and arrested by the police.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #25-28. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Mayor Wilson Fisk was reunited with his Miles Morales who has become Ultimatum. He was elated to see Ultimatum again while apologizing that he did not find what he was looking for on Earth-1610. Mayor Fisk and Miles begin their next plan together, while opposing a [[Miles Morales|Spider-Man version of Morales from an alternate reality]].<ref>''Miles Morales: Spider-Man'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===2020s===
During the "[[Last Remains]]" arc, Norman Osborn meets up with Mayor Wilson Fisk and his men as they work on a plan to dispose of Kindred for what he did to them.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #54.LR. Marvel Comics.</ref> Mayor Wilson Fisk is informed by Norman Osborn that Mary Jane Watson got through to Kindred. After Norman as Green Goblin crashed the confrontation and threw a Pumpkin Bomb near Mary Jane, he gave Mayor Fisk the signal to activate the trap which causes the tomb to be engulfed in darkness.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #55. Marvel Comics.</ref> It was revealed that they pulled this off by enlisting the help of [[Spot (comics)|Spot]] who powered Project Blank that was inspired by the Darkforce Dome that once surrounded Manhattan.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #56. Marvel Comics.</ref> With Kindred locked up in a special cell in Ravencroft, Norman Osborn stated to Spider-Man that he saved him from Mayor Wilson Fisk.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #57. Marvel Comics.</ref> At Ravencroft, Mayor Wilson Fisk talks to Kindred about their encounter in the Parisian catacombs. One of Mister Negative's lieutenants appears and informs him that the Inner Demons will help him get more than the Tablet of Life and Destiny.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #58. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Mister Negative later meets with Mayor Wilson Fisk and informs him that they will need the sister counterpart of the Tablet of Life and Destiny called the Tablet of Death and Entropy. As Mister Negative has the item, he states to Mayor Fisk that their desired function can only be used when both items are together. Mayor Fisk allows Mister Negative to control Chinatown and the Lower East Side. Outside of enlisting Mister Negative to steal the Tablet of Life and Destiny from Spider-Man and Boomerang, Mayor Fisk has also enlisted the services of the crime lords [[Black Mariah (comics)|Black Mariah]], a [[Crime Master]], [[Diamondback (Willis Stryker)|Diamondback]], [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]], [[Madame Masque]], [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]], [[Silvermane]], and [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] to obtain the Tablet of Life and Destiny where the first crime lord to obtain it will win Mayor Fisk's favor.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #59. Marvel Comics.</ref> Upon getting his hands on both tablets, Mayor Fisk uses its abilities to revive Richard Fisk as Mayor Fisk realized that Vanessa would not be pleased with her resurrection. He did this as an act of redemption for Vanessa and even himself.<ref>''Giant Size Amazing Spider-Man: King's Ransom'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[King in Black]]" storyline, one of Iron Man's plans to fight [[Knull (character)|Knull]]'s invasion is to persuade Mayor Wilson Fisk to enlist villains to help defend New York City and fight Knull's Symbiote army. This leads to Mayor Fisk paying a visit to the Bar with No Name where he asks who would like to earn some money.<ref>''King in Black'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Kingpin puts together his incarnation of the Thunderbolts with Taskmaster, Mister Fear, Batroc the Leaper, Star, Rhino, Ampere, and Snakehead. When the villain Incendiary turned him down, Mayor Fisk shot him to serve as a warning to anyone that does not take his offer. The assignment he gives them is to take Star to Ravencroft to meet up with the one person who can help defeat Knull.<ref>''King in Black: Thunderbolts'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After Mike Murdock (Matt Murdock's magically created criminal twin brother) uses the Norn stone to cement himself into reality by changing the history of the world, he inadvertently makes it so that Mayor Fisk has an illegitimate son (alongside his legitimate son Richard) with Stella Pharris named Byron "Butch" Pharris.<ref>''Daredevil Annual'' #1 (August [[2020 in comics|2020]]) [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

Sometime later, before the "[[Devil's Reign]]" storyline, Fisk discovers physical evidence proving that he once knew Daredevil's true identity, noticing gaps in his own memory after the fact. Outraged, Mayor Fisk confronts Daredevil, who taunts him. Consequentially, Mayor Fisk appoints Butch as New York's new Kingpin, outlaws [[vigilantism]] in the city, and announces his intent to run for [[President of the United States]]. While backed by Senator Arthur Krane of the [[Friends of Humanity]] and other people, Fisk also starts the Thunderbolt units to help the NYPD crack down on superhuman vigilantism. He even visits Purple Man in prison and strangles him to submission,<ref>''[[Devil's Reign]]'' #1 (December [[2021 in comics|2021]]) [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> and later imprisons him (as he would later do with his children as well<ref name="Devil's Reign 5">''Devil's Reign'' #5 (Marvel Comics, March 2022).</ref>) to use him to control people, just like [[Doctor Doom]] had done a long time ago, to secure an electoral victory for himself.<ref>''[[Devil's Reign]]'' #2 (February [[2022 in comics|2022]]) [[Marvel Comics]]. See also Marvel Graphic Novel Vol.1 #1: ''Emperor Doom'' Marvel Comics, 1987).</ref> The few superheroes who were still free, including Captain America, Spider-Man (Ben Reilly), [[She-Hulk]], [[Luke Cage]] and Daredevil, began trying to implement ways of defeating Fisk legally, including letting Cage run for mayor.<ref>''Devil's Reign'' #3 (Marvel Comics, January 2022).</ref>

Blaming Daredevil for his failures, Fisk makes the Purple Man force the population of New York City into attacking the superheroes, while Fisk seeks out Daredevil, having regained his memory of Daredevil's identity after the Purple Man was able to suggest how it might have been done as he recognized the influence of his children in the memory wipe. Fisk ends up confronting Mike Murdock, mistakes him for Matt and murders him.<ref name="Devil's Reign 5" /> In return, he and his now wife [[Typhoid Mary (character)|Typhoid Mary]] are attacked by Daredevil and Elektra. Daredevil nearly kills Fisk until Elektra intervenes. Fisk is arrested, but freed by Butch Pharris and several criminal financers, who want to install him as President of the United States next. Instead, Fisk kills them, leaves Butch to succeed him as the new Kingpin, and retires from crime with Mary by his side.<ref>''Devil's Reign'' #6 (Marvel Comics, April 2022).</ref><ref>Spencer Perry, [https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/marvel-has-a-new-kingpin-devils-reign/ ''Marvel Has a New Kingpin''].

==Skills, abilities, and equipment==
While the Kingpin has no superhuman powers, he is incredibly strong and significantly more durable than the average human, possessing remarkable strength concealed by his extremely corpulent appearance. Most of his body mass is actually muscle that has been built to extraordinary size, much like a Super Heavyweight [[sumo|sumo wrestler]], or some [[Olympic weightlifting|Olympic weightlifters]] and [[Powerlifting|powerlifters]] but at greater strength levels. He has been shown to be strong enough to hurl large men across a room,<ref name="Captain America' 1972" /> and leave imprints in concrete walls after punching them.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #69, Marvel Comics</ref> Defying his size, the Kingpin is a master of many forms of armed and unarmed combat, especially sumo wrestling. His signature move is the [[bear hug]]. His skill is such that he once fought [[Captain America]] to a standstill in hand-to-hand combat.<ref name="Captain America' 1972" /> His daily workout typically consists of simultaneously overcoming five or more trained martial artists with his bare hands,<ref>''Daredevil'' #170, Marvel Comics</ref> and he stores his valuables in a custom-built safe which has no lock, only a door which is so heavy that only the Kingpin himself is strong enough to open it.<ref>''Daredevil'' #171, Marvel Comics</ref>

He typically wears [[Kevlar]] armor under his clothing. Fisk sometimes carries an "obliterator cane", a walking stick that conceals a laser weapon that can vaporize a handgun or a person's head at close range. He typically wears an ornamental diamond stick-pin that conceals compressed sleeping gas that is effective if sprayed into a victim's face. Due to his wealth and intellectual acumen, Kingpin could use far more advanced defensive gadgets, but he prefers to use such things only as a last resort. As Fisk became less Spider-Man's enemy and more Daredevil's, he was portrayed more as a [[realism (arts)|naturalistic]] mafioso than a comic book criminal mastermind, and depended less on [[science fiction]]–like weaponry.<ref name="Born Again" />

Although state and federal authorities are aware of the Kingpin, they have never been able to prove his involvement in many crimes, and while Fisk has occasionally been incarcerated or put under investigation, his formidable legal resources and knowledge of the law have always protected him from any serious consequences. Members of the government have worked with him when necessary (even while describing him as "the devil"), such as when they needed his help to dispose of a Manhattan office building that the [[Beyonder]] turned into gold.<ref>"Gold Rush!", ''Web of Spider-Man'' #6 (September 1985); "This Gold Is Mine!", ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #268 (September 1985), Marvel Comics</ref>

The Kingpin is intellectually formidable and is a master tactician and a highly skilled planner and organizer. He is [[autodidactism|self-educated]] to university graduate level in the field of [[political science]], and is extremely skilled and knowledgeable in the organization and management of both illegal and legal business operations, allowing him to outsmart and outlast his enemies time and time again. The Kingpin's willpower is so great that he can resist even the [[Purple Man]]'s mind control.<ref>"Pawns of the Purple Man!" ''Marvel Team-Up Annual'' #4 1981</ref>

==Other versions==
===''Marvel 1602''===
In the ''[[Marvel 1602]]'' universe, Wilson Fiske is a pirate and captain of HMS ''Vanessa'', known as the King's Pin, who attacks the ship taking Peter Parquarh and Sir Norman Osborne back to England.<ref name=":1602">''[[Spider-Man: 1602]]'' #2 (November [[2009 in comics|2009]]) [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> However, although the attack leaves Osborne wounded, he and the crew are able to take the ''Vanessa'' when Peter deflects the ship's cannonballs by using his webbing to throw them back. Fiske is thrown into the sea to drown when Osborne confronts him directly, rejecting a desperate Fiske's "offer" to explain how he got his name.<ref name=":1602" />

==="Age of Apocalypse"===
In the "[[Age of Apocalypse]]" storyline, Wilson Fisk is known as Dirigible, a wealthy businessman who bought his way into the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]], a human terrorist group serving [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] that makes up for their lack of mutant powers using technology which allows them to fly and emit explosive blasts.<ref name="Apocalypse">''[[X-Universe]]'' #1 (March [[1995 in comics|1995]]) [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> Dirigible is clearly the leader of the group, as he is seen giving orders to his three teammates. Alongside Red ([[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]), the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]], and [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]], he attacks the human refugee camps of [[Wakanda (Marvel)|Wakanda]]. However, Dirigible is killed by [[Gwen Stacy#Age of Apocalypse|Gwen Stacy]].<ref name="Apocalypse" />

===''Old Man Logan''===
In the 2008–2009 "[[Old Man Logan]]" storyline, there were different versions of the Kingpin that appear in a possible future timeline in which the United States has been carved up between the various super-villains as seen on Earth-807128 and Earth-21923:

* The first Kingpin is an unnamed African-American man who is described as a "man of the people" who fought his way to the top, gaining control of the western states and killing the domain's former master [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], who had become "too old" to fight back. He renamed Magneto's former territory Kingdom of the Kingpin. [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)#Old Man Logan|Hawkeye]]'s daughter [[Spider-Bitch (Ashley Barton)|Ashley]] operated as "Spider-Bitch" and opposed Kingpin with her allies who operated as Daredevil and Punisher until Kingpin had the latter two captured and fed to carnivorous dinosaurs. Kingpin is eventually beheaded by Ashley after being freed by her father: striking her father over the head, Ashley reveals that she plans to take over Kingpin's territory herself, rather than free its people as he had assumed. Recognized as the new Kingpin by the surrounding guards, Ashley immediately attempts to have her father killed, only for him to be rescued by [[Old Man Logan|Logan]]; Ashley then sends her men after them.<ref>[[Old Man Logan]], ''Wolverine'' (vol. 3) #67–69 (September–November [[2008 in comics|2008]]) Marvel Comics.</ref>
* Ashley returns as the new Kingpin in ''[[Spider-Verse]]'' (2014–2015), ''[[Edge of Venomverse]]'' (2017), ''[[Spider-Geddon]]'' (2018), ''[[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)#Old Man Logan|Old Man Hawkeye]]'' (2018), and ''[[Star-Lord#Old Man Quill|Old Man Quill]]'' (2019).

* He appears in ''[[Marvel Zombies 3]]'' as a leader of the zombie horde, planning to invade Earth-616. He keeps his wife in hiding, satisfying his hunger (and those of other infected characters) by cloning uninfected humans as a source of food, Vanessa noting that his strength of will in controlling the hunger is the reason that he has become the leader of the remaining zombies even when the others have superpowers.<ref>''[[Marvel Zombies 3]]'' #3. [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> Eventually, he eats her when his plan is defeated.<ref>''[[Marvel Zombies 3]]'' #4. [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

An infuriated Kingpin decides to confront Spider-Man, but is quickly dispatched and devoured by Spider-Man, leaving his men to run for their lives.<ref>''Marvel Zombies Return: Spider-Man''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Punisher Max''===
Kingpin appears in a story arc in the [[Max (comics)|MAX]] version of ''The Punisher'', beginning with ''[[Punisher Max]]'' #1, with [[Bullseye (comics)#PunisherMAX|Bullseye]] as his main henchman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22088 |title=Jason Aaron Takes Punisher to the MAX |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date=2009-07-17 |access-date=2011-02-06}}</ref> Like the mainstream version he is incredibly strong, able to squeeze someone's head until their eyes pop out. He is a highly formidable hand-to-hand combatant, cunning and utterly ruthless. This version of Fisk is also married to Vanessa and has a son, Richard, who is depicted as a young child. Following Richard's death, Fisk and Vanessa separate, with both taking Hand assassin [[Elektra (character)|Elektra Natchios]] as a lover and partner while plotting against the other.<ref>''[[Punisher Max]]'' #1–21 (November [[2009 in comics|2009]]–January [[2012 in comics|2012]]) [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

===''Punisher Kills the Marvel Universe''===
In the one-shot issue ''[[Punisher Kills the Marvel Universe]]'', the Punisher goes after the Kingpin after [[Microchip (comics)|Microchip]] uses his hacking skills to destroy the Kingpin's empire. Kingpin informs the Punisher that he supported the latter's campaign to kill all of the superpowered beings, and has acquired an armory of weapons for the Punisher's use. As the Punisher attempts to shoot the Kingpin with an [[M16 rifle|M16]], the Kingpin grabs the rifle and destroys it with his bare hands. The Punisher responds by shooting two [[Desert Eagle]] pistols at the Kingpin, which only infuriates him. The Punisher kills the Kingpin by shooting him in the throat, and his body collapses on top of Castle, where he is found and arrested by [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] officers. The Punisher's benefactor breaks him out of prison, whereupon Castle reveals he killed the Kingpin to acquire his high-tech weaponry, specifically a holographic scrambler, which Castle uses to disguise a helicopter as the [[Fantastic Four]]'s Fantasti-car, so he can infiltrate [[Latveria]] to kill [[Doctor Doom]].<ref>''Punisher Kills The Marvel Universe'' (November [[1995 in comics|1995]]).

** In ''What If the Punisher had Killed Daredevil?'', the Punisher hunts down the Kingpin, who has bribed the newly elected Mayor of New York City into working for him. Since the Punisher had used up the last of his ammo to kill [[Spider-Man]] (as his alter ego Peter Parker), the wounded Punisher attacks the Kingpin with a knife, only for the Kingpin to knock the knife out of his hand, and kill him by crushing the Punisher's throat with his bare hands. However, Castle had a back-up plan: he left a bomb outside the Kingpin's office, which goes off, killing the Kingpin and the Mayor.<ref>''What If?'' vol. 2 #26 (June 1991). Marvel Comics.</ref>
** In ''What If Venom had Possessed the Punisher?'', the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote possessed Frank Castle, who used Venom's powers to murder criminals, which had the side effect of merging their personalities.

When the Punisher confronted the Kingpin, he found Daredevil and [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid Mary]] protecting him. Despite their best efforts to fight off the Punisher, the Venom symbiote used tendrils to envelop and strangle the Kingpin to death.<ref>''What If?'' vol. 2 #44 (December 1992). Marvel Comics.</ref>
** In ''What If Karen Page Had Lived?'' where Bullseye did not kill Karen Page as part of [[Mysterio]]'s final scheme, the fear of losing Karen drove Daredevil to attack the Kingpin for his role in the scheme, beating him to death.<ref>''What If Karen Page Had Lived?''

** First appearing in the [[Netflix]] series ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'', this version leads his crime family in taking over Hell's Kitchen while maintaining a presentable image to the public. However, unlike his traditional depictions, he initially lacks self-confidence, is emotionally unstable, and does not adopt the Kingpin moniker until much later. A large focus of his story in [[Daredevil (season 1)|season one]] is his budding relationship with and eventual proposal to [[Vanessa Fisk|Vanessa Mariana]] while he and his right-hand man [[James Wesley (comics)|James Wesley]] have dealings with criminals, politicians, and corrupt police officers. Eventually, Fisk is legally detained after Matt Murdock helps the FBI arrest his associates. Fisk is then beaten in combat by Murdock as [[Matt Murdock (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Daredevil]] before being arrested by [[Brett Mahoney]] and incarcerated at [[Ryker's Island]]. In [[Daredevil (season 2)|season two]], Fisk uses [[Frank Castle (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Frank Castle]] as a pawn to eliminate rival gangsters trying to usurp his power while using mob lawyer [[Big Ben Donovan|Benjamin Donovan]] as his new [[consigliere]]. When Murdock threatens Marianna during a prison visit, Fisk attacks him and receives damage similar to his fight with Daredevil, fueling his suspicions that Murdock and Daredevil may be one and the same. Fisk re-examines Murdock's files and plots to destroy Murdock's law firm as revenge. In [[Daredevil (season 3)|season three]], Fisk is released from prison after becoming a criminal informant for the FBI, scheming to regain his position in the criminal underworld under the guise of securing Marianna's return to the country with immunity. With the help of [[Fixer (person)|fixer]] Felix Manning, he manipulates his FBI protection detail, including the mentally unstable [[Bullseye (comics)|Dex Poindexter]], and uses him to frame Daredevil as a criminal to the public and kill Poindexter's coworker Ray Nadeem. Additionally, Fisk confirms that Murdock is Daredevil during a murder attempt and arranges to have him killed by the FBI. However, Poindexter realizes Fisk manipulated him and his true intentions are revealed. Fisk battles Murdock and Poindexter, breaking the latter's back before Murdock defeats him. Fisk attempts to goad Murdock into finishing him off by threatening to reveal his identity, but Murdock refuses and counter-threatens to expose Marianna for her role in Nadeem's murder before leaving Fisk to be arrested.<ref name="Oleson">{{cite web|url=https://news.marvel.com/tv/79287/vincent-donofrio-returns-as-wilson-fisk-in-season-3-of-marvels-daredevil/|title=Vincent D'Onofrio Returns As Wilson Fisk In Season 3 Of 'Marvel's Daredevil'|last=Dinh|first=Christine|publisher=[[Marvel Comics|Marvel.com]]|date=October 25, 2017|access-date=October 25, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026053750/https://news.marvel.com/tv/79287/vincent-donofrio-returns-as-wilson-fisk-in-season-3-of-marvels-daredevil/|archive-date=October 26, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Video games===
==== ''Marvel's Spider-Man'' ====
The Kingpin appears in ''[[Spider-Man (Insomniac Games series)|Marvel's Spider-Man]]'' series, voiced by [[Travis Willingham]].<ref name="E3 2017 blog post">{{cite web|last=Intihar|first=Bryan|date=June 12, 2017|title=Marvel's Spider-Man: Insomniac Details the E3 Trailer|url=https://blog.us.playstation.com/2017/06/13/marvels-spider-man-insomniac-details-the-e3-trailer/|access-date=June 14, 2017|work=PlayStation Blog}}</ref> Similarly to his comics counterpart, this version is an exceptional combatant and criminal mastermind who posed as a respectable businessman, [[philanthropist]], and owner of Fisk Industries to hide his true nature as the driving force behind most of New York's organized crime. Within the games' continuity, [[Peter Parker (Insomniac Games character)|Spider-Man]] has existed for eight years, and it is implied that Wilson Fisk has been the Kingpin for even longer. During this time, Fisk has been Spider-Man's most prominent adversary, and managed to fend off all serious charges related to his crimes because the police were never able to gather enough incriminating evidence.
* At the beginning of ''[[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|Marvel's Spider-Man]]'' (2018), in which he serves as the first boss, the police finally obtain enough evidence needed to arrest Fisk and raid Fisk Tower with Spider-Man's help. Spider-Man neutralizes Fisk's private army as well as several officers on his payroll and defeats the Kingpin in combat, leading to his incarceration at the maximum security prison, the [[Raft (comics)|Raft]]. However, Fisk correctly predicts that his arrest will cause crime rates to skyrocket as new criminal figures such as [[Mister Negative]] and [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] attempt to fill the power vacuum, with Spider-Man even admitting this later on. Despite being incarcerated, Fisk continues to maintain a number of fronts throughout the city, allowing him to continue financing his criminal empire, though Spider-Man helps the police find and dismantle them while also preventing Fisk's remaining men from breaking him out of custody.
* In the follow-up, ''[[Spider-Man: Miles Morales|Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales]]'' (2020), a side-mission revolves around the new [[Miles Morales|Spider-Man]] confronting Kingpin after discovering the latter recruited a gang of his former associates to sow chaos in [[Harlem]] and drive out local businesses so he can purchase their land and rebuild his empire once he gets out of prison. After Spider-Man thwarts an attack on a local block party, Fisk receives additional years to his sentence and is put under tighter surveillance by prison authorities.

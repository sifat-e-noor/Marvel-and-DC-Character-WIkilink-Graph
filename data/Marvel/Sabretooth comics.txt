'''Sabretooth''' ('''Victor Creed''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], most commonly in association with the [[X-Men]], in particular as an enemy of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist/co-writer [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], the character first appeared in ''[[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]'' #14 (August [[1977 in comics|1977]]).<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=303}}</ref> Sabretooth was originally portrayed as a non-powered [[serial killer]] but was later written as a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] possessing bestial superhuman abilities, most notably a rapid healing factor, razor-sharp fangs and claws, and superhuman senses. He is a vicious [[assassination|assassin]], responsible for numerous deaths both as a paid mercenary and for his personal pleasure. Accounts as to the origin of his enmity with Wolverine are conflicted. It is known that Wolverine and Sabretooth were participants of the [[Cold War]] [[supersoldier]] program [[Weapon X]], and that Sabretooth saw Wolverine as competition and therefore antagonized him. While Wolverine is depicted as suppressing his more savage qualities, Sabretooth does the opposite and embraces them, until the events of the 2014 storyline "[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]".

The character has appeared in several [[X-Men]] [[animation|animated series]] and [[video game]]s, and was portrayed by [[Tyler Mane]] in the [[X-Men (film)|first ''X-Men'' film]] and by [[Liev Schreiber]] in the 2009 film ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]''. In May 2008, [[Wizard (magazine)|''Wizard'']] magazine ranked Sabretooth #193 of the 200 best comic book characters of all time.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.wizarduniverse.com/051308top200characters.html |title= The 200 Greatest Comic Book Characters of All Time |first= |last= |author= |author-link= |date= May 13, 2008 |publisher= [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard: The Magazine of Comics, Entertainment and Pop Culture]] |trans-title=|doi= |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090616181416/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/051308top200characters.html |archivedate= June 16, 2009 |access-date= April 19, 2011}}</ref> In 2009, Sabretooth was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 44th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/44.html Sabretooth is number 44] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104231922/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/44.html |date=2014-01-04 }}.

==Publication history==
[[File:Iron Fist vs Sabretooth comic cover.jpg|right|thumb|upright|"Sabre-Tooth" first appeared in ''[[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]'' #14.]]
The character first appeared in ''Iron Fist'' #14 (August 1977) and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]. Sabretooth was initially conceived as a recurring antagonist for [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], whom he fights several times. He works for a time with [[Constrictor (comics)|the Constrictor]] as a partner-in-crime, and clashes repeatedly with Iron Fist and [[Luke Cage|Power Man]].<ref name="Power Man and Iron Fist #66">''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #66. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref name="Power Man and Iron Fist #84">''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #84. Marvel Comics.</ref> Sabretooth also appeared in comics such as ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]''. Chris Claremont introduced him as a minor [[X-Men]] villain, a member of [[Marauders (comics)|the Marauders]], during the "[[Mutant Massacre]]" crossover in 1986.<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=303}}</ref>

He rose to greater prominence when he was split off from the Marauders and became a recurring antagonist of an individual member of the X-Men, Wolverine. Sabretooth was subsequently featured in [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] and [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] [[Comic book|comics]] including ''Sabretooth and [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]'' and ''Sabretooth: In the Red Zone'', and even had his own ongoing reprint series in the mid-1990s, ''Sabretooth Classics''.

===Origin===
Chris Claremont had meant for Sabretooth to be Wolverine's father, though this was contradicted  by subsequent writers. Claremont, when asked what he had intended to be the relationship between Wolverine and Sabretooth, stated:

<blockquote>Father and son. That's why Sabretooth always considered Logan "sloppy seconds" to his "original" / "real deal." The other critical element in my presentation of their relationship was that, in their whole life, Logan has never defeated Sabretooth in a knock-down, drag-out, kill-or-be-killed berserker fight. By the same token, on every one of his birthdays, Sabretooth has always managed to find him, no matter where Logan was or what he was doing, and come within an inch of killing him. For no other reason than to remind him that he could.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/sabretooth-1-preview-x-men-revenge-marvel-comics |title=Sabretooth Vows Revenge on the X-Men in New Marvel Comics Preview |website=[[Screen Rant]] |date=December 30, 2021 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://x-mencomics.com/xfan/forums/showthread.php?t=14411&page=13&pp=20 |title=X-Men Comics Forums |access-date=January 22, 2006 |archive-date=September 28, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928044912/http://x-mencomics.com/xfan/forums/showthread.php?t=14411&page=13&pp=20 |url-status=bot: unknown }}</ref></blockquote>

[[genetics|Genetic]] tests performed by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] confirmed that Sabretooth and Wolverine were not father and son.<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #42. Marvel Comics.</ref>

An interviewer asked [[Paul Jenkins (writer)|Paul Jenkins]] if [[Dog Logan]] was Sabretooth. Jenkins had not intended the speculation, but said would not have a problem with another writer doing this later.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dog-logan/4005-44327 |title=Dog Logan (Character) - Comic Vine |access-date=April 2, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://wolverinefiles.com/wolverine-the-origin |title=Wolverine Files: The Origin |access-date=January 9, 2008}}</ref> The miniseries ''Astonishing Spider-Man & Wolverine'' has shown that the two characters are not the same person.<ref>''Astonishing Spider-Man and Wolverine'' #6.

===''X-Men Forever''===
In ''[[X-Men Forever]]'', Chris Claremont's continuation of his run on ''X-Men'' (non-canonical to the mainstream timeline and taking place in the 161 Marvel Universe), Sabretooth is established as Wolverine's father. He attacks the X-Mansion, but is blinded by Storm.<ref name="X-Men Forever #2"/>

Claremont has stated in an interview that in ''X-Men Forever'' the original true Sabretooth makes his reappearance after a long time, and that most of the previous appearances of Sabretooth prior to ''X-Men Forever'' #2, that follows directly after ''X-Men'' vol. 2 #3, were that of a weaker Sabretooth clone created by [[Mister Sinister]]. The original true Sabretooth reappears dressed in the [[Jim Lee]] costume in ''X-Men Forever'', which would make the weaker clone the one dressed in the John Byrne costume. Claremont claims he always meant for the Sabretooth dressed in the Byrne costume to be later outed as a clone of the original true Sabretooth. Claremont stated: "Speaking specifically of the cast of ''X-Men Forever'', one character who's becoming more enticing is Sabretooth, in part because (at least as it relates to my conception of him) very little is actually known. They then filled his skeleton with adamantium. At this specific point of his life, readers haven't really seen that much of him over the years, since the Sabes that's shown up most over the time is a less-endowed copy cloned from spare cells by Mr. Sinister."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://xmennation.com/articles/latest-articles/creating-claremont-an-exclusive-interview-with-mr-chris-claremont.html| last=Lurie | first=Jordan | title=Creating Claremont - An Exclusive Interview with Mr. Chris Claremont | work=X-Men Nation | date= June 3, 2009}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life===
Sabretooth's real name is believed to be Victor Creed.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #5 (February 1992)</ref> Sabretooth's memories have been tampered with by clandestine organizations such as [[Weapon X]] and so much of what appears to be his past is not of credible account.{{efn|Conflicting accounts in ''Origin II'', ''Origins: Sabretooth'', ''X-Men'', ''Uncanny X-Men'' in the 90s, and the 90s ''Sabretooth'' limited series}}{{issue|date=April 2017}} The clearest accounts of Victor's childhood begin with him murdering his brother Luther Creed over a piece of pie.<ref name="X-Men Origins - Sabretooth">''X-Men Origins - Sabretooth''</ref> His father Zebediah then chains him in the basement like an animal and systematically pulls out Victor's elongated canines, which perennially grow back. Victor begs his mother Victoria to let him go, but she does not.<ref name="X-Men Origins - Sabretooth"/> Years pass until Victor eventually gnaws off his own hand in order to escape the basement and apparently murders his parents.<ref name="X-Men Origins - Sabretooth"/> It is, however, later revealed that Sabretooth only killed his father, and took care of his mother financially, visiting her frequently until the woman's death.<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 4 #11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Victor is revealed to have had a brother named Saul and a sister named Clara who are believed to be the reason for Victor's ongoing feud with the X-Men's [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. Saul Creed was a tracker and hunter, while Clara Creed was an animal handler. They helped track down the feral James "Logan" Howlett for a circus.<ref>''Origin II'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> They also helped Logan escape after the man was experimented on by [[Mister Sinister|Nathaniel Essex]], and the three go on the run.<ref>''Origin II'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Saul perceives Logan to be stealing Clara, leading to Saul tipping Essex off regarding Logan's location. In the ensuing chaos, Logan accidentally kills Clara, although her healing factor later revives Clara. Saul, not knowing this, blames Essex for Clara's death, and the two men seek Essex out, Saul revealing that Clara was his sister.<ref>''Origin II'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> Logan, however, finds out that Saul betrayed them to Essex, and drowns Saul in a potion of Essex's. Horrified by this, Clara asks Wolverine to never look for her again. Victor was then informed about his brother's death.<ref>''Origin II'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In an early tale, Logan lives in a small [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfoot community]]. One day, Sabretooth tracks him down in Canada, and seemingly murders his one-time teammate's lover [[Silver Fox (comics)|Silver Fox]] on Logan's birthday, after Silver Fox rejects him. In this tale, it is indicated that Logan did not have particularly strong feelings for Silver Fox, and that the murder was simply the last straw in a series of grievances he held against Sabretooth.<ref name="Wolverine #10">''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #10. Marvel Comics.</ref> Creed eventually adopts a tradition of tracking Logan down on his foe's birthday with the intention of fighting.<ref name="X-Men Origins - Sabretooth"/>

===Early history===
Creed is recruited into a top secret [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] [[covert operation|covert ops]] unit known as [[Team X (comics)|Team X]], with allies John Wraith ([[Kestrel (Marvel Comics)|Kestrel]]), Logan (Wolverine), Silver Fox (whose death was a hoax), and David North ([[David North (comics)|Maverick]]). On one mission, the psychopathic Sabretooth kills a crucial scientist during a battle against Russian supersoldier [[Omega Red]], causing Team X to break up.<ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #4-7</ref> During this period he fathers a son, [[Graydon Creed]], with the mutant [[shapeshifting|shapeshifter]] [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], who is undercover in the guise of a spy named Leni Zauber. Graydon grows up to found [[Friends of Humanity]], an anti-mutant organization, and while running for president is assassinated by Mystique from an alternate future.<ref name="X-Men Forever #2">''X-Men Forever'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After the disbanding of Team X, Logan and Victor meet up again, as friends, when Logan learns of anti-mutant forces within the government. Victor and Logan form a team of rebel mutants, and Victor falls in love with a mutant named Holo. Eventually, Creed grows tired of the fighting and wants to leave with Holo, but she has already decided against it. In the final conflict, Holo is mortally wounded. Creed blames Logan for her death.<ref>''First X-Men'' #1-5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Next, Sabretooth is recruited by the [[Weapon X]] program, but it is unknown what, if any, enhancements he receives. As part of the program, his memories are tampered with by the psychic mutant Aldo Ferro, also known as Psi-Borg.<ref>''Sabretooth'' #2 (September 1993). Marvel Comics.</ref>

In 1968, Creed (using the alias Sabretooth) works as a mercenary assassin in [[Saigon]]. An individual called the "White Devil", involved in the disappearance of soldiers and locals, contacts Sabretooth and offers to employ him as one of his own [[Marauders (comics)|enforcers]]. Sabretooth accepts.<ref name="Weapon X #27 vol. 2">''Weapon X'' vol. 2 #27. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Supervillain===
{{Overly detailed|date=December 2014|section=yes}}
Emerging as a costumed villain, Sabretooth becomes partners with the Constrictor and the two act as enforcers for major criminal interests. Sabretooth battles [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] and is badly beaten.<ref>''Iron Fist'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref> Sabretooth and the Constrictor then fight Iron Fist, [[Luke Cage]], [[Misty Knight]], and [[Colleen Wing]] only to be defeated again.<ref name="Power Man and Iron Fist #66"/> With the Constrictor, Creed begins to stalk and kill human beings for pleasure, which earns him the newspaper title of "The Slasher"; he also attacks Misty Knight again.<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #78. Marvel Comics.</ref> With the Constrictor, he attacks Harmony Young, but they are defeated by Luke Cage.<ref name="Power Man and Iron Fist #84"/> The Constrictor and Sabretooth dissolve their partnership, and Sabretooth nearly kills the Constrictor at one time.

Sabretooth is next reunited with his employer, the [[Foreigner (comics)|Foreigner]], who claims to have trained the mercenary at some point. He attacks the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], nearly biting through her leg until he encounters a crowbar hidden underneath her boot. He is defeated by [[Spider-Man]], and outmaneuvered and humiliated by the Black Cat in combat.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #116, #119. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Sabretooth eventually encounters a thief by the name of [[Gambit (Marvel Comics)|Gambit]] and the two fight, but find they are not exactly enemies.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #33. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later while recruiting for [[Mister Sinister]], Gambit gathers a group of mutant criminals he has associated with who form the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #350. Marvel Comics.</ref> Sinister clones several of the Marauders so that he has a loyal group of lackeys after the originals die.<ref>''X-Men'' #37. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Marauders are directed to [[Mutant Massacre|massacre]] the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]], which sets Sabretooth in another battle against Wolverine.<ref>''X-Factor'' #10; ''Thor'' #374; ''Uncanny X-Men'' #212-213. Marvel Comics.</ref> Sabretooth and the Marauders join in an attack on [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Polaris]], and battle Wolverine again during the Marauders' attempt to kill [[Madelyne Pryor]]. Wolverine stabs Sabretooth through the heart and uses [[Scrambler (comics)|Scrambler]]'s power to disable his healing factor, killing him.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #219, #221-222. Marvel Comics.</ref> He is replaced by a clone by the time the X-Men attack the Marauders' headquarters. With the X-Men slaughtering his teammates, Sabretooth flees<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #240-241. Marvel Comics.</ref> and is reunited with Mr. Sinister at the X-Mansion.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #243. Marvel Comics.</ref> The X-Men and [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] attack them there, and apparently kill both Sabretooth and Sinister.<ref>''X-Factor'' #39. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, Sabretooth manages to keep his tradition of stalking Wolverine on his birthday that year.<ref name="Wolverine #10"/>

Sabretooth returns to the sewers to slaughter leftover Morlocks. He kills [[Chickenwings]], hunts [[Mole (comics)|Mole]], and then battles [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #51-53. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]], a surviving Morlock, hunts Sabretooth down. Sabretooth proves no match for Caliban, who breaks his back and leaves him for dead.<ref>''New Mutants'' #90-91. Marvel Comics.</ref> It takes weeks for his healing factor to repair his spine, during which he sustains himself on sewer water and passing vermin. He recovers just in time to confront Wolverine, who stumbled upon him while lost in the sewers.<ref>''Wolverine'' #41-42. Marvel Comics.</ref> He attacks Wolverine again in [[Times Square]], but their conflict is cut short by a vigilante who shoots them both with [[hallucinogen]]-laced bullets which trigger memories of their time as partners in the CIA.<ref>''Wolverine'' #45-46. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Sabretooth then allies with [[Fenris (comics)|Fenris]] and [[Matsu'o Tsurayaba]] against the X-Men and Maverick.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #5-7. Marvel Comics.</ref> While attending a wrestling match, Sabretooth is attacked by the Weapon X robot [[Shiva (Marvel Comics)|Shiva]]. He is rescued by John Wraith, who convinces him to team up with the rest of Team X - Wolverine, Maverick, Silver Fox, and John Wraith - to discover why their anti-aging factors are suddenly failing. Their quest leads them to the telepath Aldo Ferro, the Psi-Borg. Ferro overwhelms them all with psychic illusions, concluding with a toothed tree which apparently consumes Creed.<ref>''Wolverine'' #60-64. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Suffering from severe bloodlust, Sabretooth hires telepathic mutant [[Birdy (comics)|Birdy]] to help him keep his urges in check by providing what he calls "the glow", a [[psychic]] blast that satiates his bloodlust and numbs the pain of his suppressed memories as a youth, allowing himself control for short periods.<ref>''Sabretooth'' #1</ref>

===Betrayal of the X-Men and brief alliance with X-Factor===
{{Overly detailed|date=December 2014|section=yes}}
A short time later, Birdy is killed by Sabretooth's grown son Graydon, who now has a hatred for mutants, especially his father. Without "the glow", Sabretooth slips into a murderous killing spree.<ref>''Sabretooth'' #4</ref> This culminates in a clash with Maverick, whom Sabretooth defeats. He escapes, claiming only Wolverine can do what needs to be done to the psychotic Creed. Afterward, Maverick approaches the X-Men in [[Japan]], and an ancient telepath, comatose since the nuclear bomb that destroyed [[Hiroshima]], who mind-links with Creed and the team discovers Creed's psychosis was rooted in his time as a CIA operative. On a mission, he slaughtered a target, his wife (a "frail" for Creed), and a little boy. The look in the boy's eyes has followed Creed ever since. Ultimately, Sabretooth attacks [[Charles Xavier]], leader of the X-Men. As Xavier infiltrates Creed's mind, he discovers that every victim Sabretooth has killed is remembered by the villain. Xavier is confident this means Creed values human life, and there is hope for the mutant. Sabretooth is incarcerated, as a wanted murderer, in a holographic environment because Xavier does not want him to roam on the grounds. Sabretooth is angered, but grudgingly stays with the team. During his incarceration, he assists in battles against the [[X-Cutioner]] and the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]]. Caliban, free of Apocalypse's control, kidnaps the X-Man [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] in exchange for Sabretooth. When Sabretooth arrives, he mauls Caliban's face, and Caliban flees.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #18</ref> Wolverine, who had left the team after his [[adamantium]] was removed by [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], returns, and the villain escapes for a fight. This leads to Wolverine stabbing one of his claws into Sabretooth's brain.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #90. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The newer, gentler Sabretooth is frequently nursed by [[X-Force]] member [[Tabitha Smith|Boomer]]; he eventually reveals that he was feigning helplessness, and attacks Boomer. Psylocke saves the young mutant's life, and she uses her psionic knife to disable him. However, this no longer works because his brain injury from Wolverine freed him from the need for "the glow", furthermore rendering him resistant to telepathic detection and control. Retaliating, Sabretooth nearly kills Psylocke, but he is finally confronted by the X-Men, who incapacitate him.<ref>''Sabretooth: In The Red Zone''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

He is turned over to the custody of Dr. [[Valerie Cooper]], who fits him with an explosive restraining collar and forces him to participate as a member of the government-sponsored [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] team.{{issue|date=April 2012}} Creed later admits he was a "sleeper" agent with the mission of executing X-Factor members the government could not control.{{issue|date=April 2012}} He eventually escapes,{{issue|date=April 2012}} and returns once more to mercenary work.{{issue|date=April 2012}} Under unknown circumstances he gains adamantium skeleton and claws.<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol. 2) #126. Marvel Comics.</ref> Sabretooth is captured, along with Wolverine, by Apocalypse, who forces the two to fight each other for the right to become Apocalypse's new [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Horseman]], Death. After Sabretooth's defeat, Apocalypse extracts the adamantium from him and bonds it to Wolverine, Wolverine having fought to win as he felt that he might resist the brainwashing and so be easier to defeat than Sabretooth, who might actually enjoy what he had become.<ref name="Wolverine vol. 2 #145">''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #145. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Sabretooth then joins Mystique's new [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], calling itself the Brotherhood, where he participates in an assassination attempt against Senator [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Robert Kelly]].{{Issue|date=September 2009}}

===Weapon X and the Brotherhood===
{{Overly detailed|date=December 2014|section=yes}}
Later, he is forced to become a member of a relaunched Weapon X program, where his skeleton is infused with adamantium once more. In ''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #166, Sabretooth reveals that by means of genetic enhancement the Weapon X program has increased his strength and accelerated his healing factor. Eventually he escaped the program again and resumed working solo. However, he sometimes worked on a team, such as when he worked with several other villains to locate the [[Identity Disc]], a record of heroes' secret identities. This ended up being a ruse, though Nick Fury had the real disc.<ref>''Identity Disc'' limited series (2004). Marvel Comics.</ref>{{issue|date=April 2017}}

Later, in [[Canada]], he encountered [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] and the newest [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]]. Sasquatch believes Creed may be responsible for some of the human deaths occurring there. Creed is seen setting traps and acting mysteriously. Sasquatch discovers Sabretooth is playing a twisted mind-game with the Wendigo before attempting to kill it. Sabretooth and the Wendigo fall into the [[Arctic Sea]] with Sabretooth biting the Wendigo's neck, and both are presumed dead by Sasquatch. After a fearsome battle in the arctic waters, Sabretooth emerged victorious with the hide of the Wendigo.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Sabretooth would later attack the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]], in a revamped Brotherhood consisting of leader [[Black Tom Cassidy]], [[Mammomax]], [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]], [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]], and undercover heroes [[Nocturne (Talia Wagner)|Nocturne]] and [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]].{{issue|date=December 2012}} Wolverine claims to have killed Sabretooth, spreading him "all over the grass", although Black Tom's plant abilities probably contributed to Sabretooth's survival; he returns in ''X-Men: The 198 Files''.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

===Reluctant alliance with the X-Men===
{{Overly detailed|date=December 2014|section=yes}}
[[File:Sabretooth xmen189.jpg|upright|thumb|Promotional art for ''X-Men'' vol. 2 #189 (September 2006).<br />Art by [[Chris Bachalo]] and Tim Townsend.]]
In ''X-Men'' vol. 2 #188 (August 2006), Sabretooth was spotted fleeing a mysterious group of superhumans collectively known as [[Children of the Vault|The Children]]. Their reasons for pursuing him remained unknown, but two of them‚Äî[[Sangre (comics)|Sangre]] and [[Serafina (Marvel)|Serafina]]‚Äîwere tracking him. Sangre activated a singularity generator that annihilated most of the town and killed all its citizens, except for a little girl whom Serafina deliberately shielded from the destruction so there would be a witness to what had happened. He later encountered two more of the Children‚Äî[[Aguja (comics)|Aguja]] and [[Fuego (comics)|Fuego]]. They attacked him and temporarily neutralized his healing factor, but he managed to escape regardless, only to end up at the Xavier Institute later that night seeking sanctuary.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

It is revealed that the Children are after Creed because he has seen them and knows who they are, while the public believed the X-Men destroyed the town. It is only when [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], the leader of the team, injected Nano-Sentinels into Sabretooth's blood that they take him along with their fight against the Children, a factor that one of the Children exploited. At one point, [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] saved his life during the battle. Sabretooth rewards him with some inside information: "The first time you turn your back, you're dead." Following the incident on [[Providence (comics)|Providence]], Creed escaped the X-Men, but was hurled into the middle of the [[Pacific Ocean]] by Cable.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Writer [[Mike Carey (British writer)|Mike Carey]] noted he has no plans on redeeming Sabretooth, saying, "I'm not going to try and show a heroic side to Sabretooth's nature; I‚Äôm not going to [[retroactive continuity|retcon]] him so that there are reasons for his actions that make him forgivable. The things he's done are not forgivable and he can't be redeemed. I'm not making him into a hero; I'm making him into a team member and there are reasons within the first storyline as to why he ends up fighting alongside the X-Men against another enemy. And there are reasons why it's not so easy to simply shake him off again afterwards. There are things that are going on that will sort of unfold during the first year of my run which explain his being there and explain his being accepted with very, very grave misgivings into the team."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.houseofx.org/blog/tag/Mike+Carey |title=Mike Carey - House of X |date=July 2, 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.brokenfrontier.com/lowdown/details.php?id=362 |title=New to the Mansion - Part II |access-date=July 11, 2006 |archive-date=May 9, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509015156/http://www.brokenfrontier.com/lowdown/details.php?id=362 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Death===
{{Overly detailed|date=December 2014|section=yes}}
Sabretooth renews his rivalry with Wolverine following the latter's return to the X-Mansion. A fight soon breaks out with Wolverine tossing Sabretooth through a window. During the fight, Wolverine thinks back to the time when Sabretooth had, supposedly, killed Silver Fox. He remembers Sabretooth saying, "''quod sum eris''" and asks what it means. Sabretooth explains that it means "I am what you will be." Wolverine loses control and calls Sabretooth insane before placing his fist against Sabretooth's throat. Creed tells him if he extracts his claws, he will rip his heart out. Wolverine replies, "Let 'er rip", and pops his claws into Sabretooth's throat.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #50. Marvel Comics.</ref> Wolverine later regains consciousness and finds himself chained to the roof of the [[Blackbird (comics)|Blackbird]]. He quickly breaks free of the chains and is surprised to find Sabretooth piloting the jet. Wolverine breaks into the cockpit and begins choking Sabretooth with one of the chains and causes him to crash.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

The two emerge from the flaming wreckage and, while healing from the injuries sustained in the crash, begin fighting once again until separated by a lightning bolt, courtesy of Wolverine's former teammate and current Queen of [[Wakanda]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]].<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #51. Marvel Comics.</ref> A short time later Sabretooth is chained up in the royal palace of Wakanda and complains to Wolverine, Storm, and the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]. Sabretooth snaps the chains and escapes into the jungle, with the Black Panther quickly giving chase. The Black Panther catches up to him and the two begin to fight, with Sabretooth quickly gaining the upper hand. He holds the Black Panther off the ground by the neck, preparing to strike a killing blow, when Wolverine suddenly appears and slices off Sabretooth's left hand.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #53. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Once the fight between the Black Panther and Sabretooth is broken up by Wolverine, Sabretooth is brought back to the Wakandan Palace and placed in a [[vibranium]] holding cell and guarded around the clock. The battle scene between the Black Panther and Sabretooth then becomes the focus of why Wolverine was brought to the palace in the first place. It seems that amongst the bones from an elephant graveyard, there are also some unidentified skeletal remains of another offshoot of Homo sapiens called "Lupus sapiens". The Black Panther and Wolverine are discussing that instead of there being one evolutionary path between humans and monkeys, that there may also have been one that developed from lupines. It is believed at this point that [[Romulus (comics)|Romulus]] is the first of this race, and it is revealed that he has been the one behind [[Daken]]'s attacks, and the driving force behind the Weapon X program. After the discussion with the Black Panther, Wolverine is awakened by the stench of blood from something that has a scent similar to his and Sabretooth's and also something else. It turns out to be an enhanced [[Wild Child (comics)|Wild Child]] who has now surpassed the abilities of both Wolverine and Sabretooth, thanks to Romulus. Wild Child strikes Wolverine with poison-tipped claws and incapacitates him for two days. When Wolverine awakens, he finds Sasquatch, [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]], and [[Feral (comics)|Feral]] and her sister [[Thornn]] ready to go back with him to the Weapon X complex so that they might get to the bottom of this lupine mystery.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

Once they all arrive at the Weapon X facility, Wolverine is plagued by memories that seem to mix past and present together and all of them controlled by Romulus. Wolverine goes in alone telling the others to stay put on the plane, but they do not listen. Feral and Thornn, who were granted their lupine appearance back by Romulus, are separated and Sabretooth, reduced to his animalistic state, has gutted Feral and she is dying. Wolverine gets Feral back to the ship and finds that Thornn and Wolfsbane are in shock from the encounter, along with Sasquatch having been incapacitated by Wild Child. Once they are on their way, Wolverine goes back to the Xavier Institute and asks [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] to give him back the Muramasa sword, which he gave to Scott in case he was too out of control and needed to be put down for good. Cyclops only does this after [[Emma Frost]] reads Wolverine's mind and sees the horrors that Wolverine has been witnessing when he dreams: the horrors committed by Victor Creed throughout the years. Sword in hand, Wolverine then sets out to find and kill Sabretooth once and for all.<ref name="Wolverine vol. 3 #55">''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #55. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After the events in "Evolution", Wolverine has been waiting for an unspecified length of time at Silver Fox's cabin in the Canadian wilderness. Sabretooth finally shows up and immediately attacks him. In the ensuing battle Wolverine cuts off Sabretooth's left arm with the [[Muramasa]]. Sabretooth, still in his animalistic state tries to re-attach his arm allowing his healing factor to kick in, but it does not work. Wolverine explains to a bewildered Creed that it is because the sword interrupts the healing factor and that he has to finally kill Sabretooth for what he has done. Managing to regain control and speak between grunts, Sabretooth tells him, "Do it". Wolverine then decapitates Sabretooth, finally putting an end to his long-time enemy. Logan then walks away, leaving both Creed's body and head in the snow to rot.<ref name="Wolverine vol. 3 #55"/>

Sabretooth appears to Wolverine, leashed and under the control of the [[Marduk Kurios|Devil]] himself, who has claimed to have broken Victor's will.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 4 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Victor shows defiance by striking the face of his defeated master after Wolverine uses his broken bone claws to pin the Devil to a wall.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 4 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> After Wolverine has an interrupted discussion with his father, it is shown that Victor wields the Devil's sword, which is being held as a symbol of who is the ruler of Hell. Wolverine fights Victor again, mentioning, as he beheads him once more, that there is no coming back when someone is killed by the sword. Wolverine leaves Victor's beheaded soul lying in the pit of Hell.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 4 #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Sabretooth tells Kilgore the best way to destroy them is to hit them in the heart, physical or metaphorical. Kilgore figures that the heart of the school is Beast (Henry McCoy). Sabretooth ambushes the latter managing to physically wound him before taking his fight to [[Abigail Brand]], Hank's girlfriend. With help from Beast, Abigail is able to blast Sabretooth away.<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later while investigating the grave of Sabretooth, Wolverine finds that the body still is in it, which indicates that Sabretooth was not resurrected. Wolverine also discovers that it was apparently Romulus behind everything and after being beaten, he is saved by a mysterious woman with long red hair who tells him to go to the Weapon X facility, but she disappears before he gets further answers.

===House of X===
In the pages of "[[House of X and Powers of X]]", Mystique, Sabretooth, and [[Toad (Marvel Comics)|Toad]] infiltrate the base of [[Damage Control (comics)|Damage Control]] searching for information in the databases. While they get what they searched for, Sabertooth maims several guards in the chaos and is eventually captured by the [[Fantastic Four]]. While the Fantastic Four are about to take away Sabretooth, [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] arrives to bring him back to Krakoa due to diplomatic immunity. While tensions arise between him and [[Mister Fantastic]], Cyclops decides to leave Sabretooth to them to avoid a situation.<ref>''House of X'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> In the superhuman prison known as Project Achilles, a trial is being held for Sabretooth.

Sabretooth lived out several fantasy lives to entertain himself, at one point he even imagined himself walking freely through Krakoa. Although he remained in the pit, he was seen on Krakoa. While fantasizing about being king of Hell, he was interrupted by the arrival of the other exiled mutants [[Nekra]], [[Madison Jeffries]], [[Oya (comics)|Oya]], [[Melter]], and Third-Eye. He welcomed them to his Hell and informed them there is no escape.<ref>''Sabretooth'' Vol. 4 #1.

Marvel Comics.</ref> Victor then began working on a plan for them all to escape The Pit, he taught them how to project their consciousness through the island and had them manifest themselves to gather allies from above. He decided to keep Melter back because he could sense he still had loyalty to Professor X. After brutalizing Melter, Sabretooth explained his plan to exposing the secret and inhumane imprisonments on Krakoa to bring public opinion against the Quiet Council, while he was talking Melter was able to gain enough control of his body to destroy Sabretooth's body in the material plane.<ref>''Sabretooth'' Vol. 4 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> The destruction of Sabretooth's body almost kills everyone in the pit because it was controlled by his mind, but Third-Eye saves the other prisoners by dragging their consciousnesses to the astral plane. Sabretooth's mind retreats into his memories while his healing factor fixes his body, he briefly manifests himself on land again to check the progress of his plan and finds rescue attempts are already being discussed. Back in his mental world he recreates his childhood home so he can have dinner with the other prisoners, after doing so they all discuss what they did to get thrown in the pit and whether they deserved to be there. Cypher than reached out to Victor again, angry that he'd been misusing their gift but Victor pointed out to them his plan was close to succeeding and convinced him they had no choice but to set him free.<ref>''Sabretooth'' Vol 4 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> Sabretooth escaped from The Pit shortly after a failed attempt by [[Magma (comics)|Magma]] to free them resulted in everyone in the area being knocked unconscious. With no-one to see him and or offer resistance he ran towards Nekra's abandoned boat but was stopped unexpectedly by Mystique. [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]] had foreseen his escape attempt but to their shock told Mystique to allow him to sail off to freedom, asking him to "cause chaos", which he happily accepted. Cypher then sent the other exiles he had abandoned on a mission to find Sabretooth so he can face punishment for his escape.<ref>''Sabretooth'' Vol. 4 #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
{{Overly detailed|date=December 2014|section=yes}}
[[File:SabretoothTracking.jpg|thumb|270px|upright|Sabretooth using his tracking skills to find Wolverine.]]
Sabretooth is a mutant with a number of both natural and artificial improvements to his physiology compared to normal humans. His primary mutant power is an accelerated healing ability that allows him to regenerate damaged or destroyed areas of his body and cellular structure far beyond the capabilities of an ordinary human. Like Wolverine's, his abilities have been depicted with variable degrees of contradiction by various creators. Sabretooth's increased attributes stem, in part from said healing. This "healing factor" also grants him virtual immunity against most poisons, drugs, toxins, and diseases, and limited immunity to fatigue.<ref name="OHOTMU vol.4 #6">''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' vol. 4 #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> The regenerative qualities of his powers cause him to age at an unusually slow rate. While he is of an unknown advanced age, Sabretooth has the appearance and vitality of a tall, very burly, highly muscular man in his late 20s to mid 30s.

The depiction of Sabretooth's powers has changed and evolved depending on creative team, with his healing power introduced as a [[retcon]] after he became Wolverine's rival. In other, earlier appearances, Sabretooth was much more average. In a fight with Spider-Man, he was incapacitated when his face was severely wounded, and did not display any accelerated healing.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' vol. 1 #116. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Sabretooth returned, his still prominent wounds were reopened when he was hit in the face.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' vol. 1 #119. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Sabretooth possesses acute senses that are comparable to certain animals. This includes the ability to see objects with greater clarity and at much greater distances than an ordinary human. He is able to see with this same level of clarity in almost complete darkness, just like a nocturnal hunter. It is also that said he can see [[infrared]] and [[ultraviolet]] portions of the spectrum.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' vol. 3 #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

He possesses some degree of notable physical abilities, such as superhuman strength due to his healing factor. The exact limits of his strength are unknown, though he originally could crush an iron barbell with ease.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 1 #213. Marvel Comics.</ref> His physical strength has been artificially enhanced at least twice. The first was a strength enhancement from his son, Graydon.<ref>''Sabretooth: Death Hunt'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> It was then further enhanced after joining the latest incarnation of the Weapon X Program.<ref>''Weapon X'' vol. 2 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> His healing factor also grants him superhuman stamina, so he can push himself at peak capacity for several days before fatigue sets in.<ref name="OHOTMU vol.4 #6"/> On top of this he is depicted as having retractable claws that can rend normal clothing and flesh with ease.<ref name="OHOTMU vol.4 #6"/>

His agility and reflexes were both naturally above human and further artificially-enhanced. With an ability to pounce like a hunting [[big cat]], stalk and move quietly throughout his appearances, most human and some super powered enemies can not react to his leap before being hit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wolverine.org/enemies/58-sabretooth |title=Wolverine's Enemies: Sabretooth |publisher=Wolverine.org |date= |access-date=2010-10-04}}</ref>

===Skills===
Sabretooth is an excellent hand-to-hand and armed combatant, having been trained by various organizations such as the CIA, Department H's Weapon X program, the Foreigner, and [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]]. He is also an expert at hunting and tracking, even without the use of his heightened senses. Sabretooth also developed a high resistance to telepathic probing and manipulation, after an incident where his brain was skewered.<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #90. Marvel Comics.</ref> And even with that damage to his brain, it has been shown that Sabretooth is actually quite intelligent compared to the average person, as shown by his ability to avoid capture and escape the highest levels of incarceration without assistance. He is also highly skilled at [[psychological manipulation]], and has demonstrated the ability to speak fluent [[German language|German]].<ref>''Black Widow'' #2 (2019). Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Reception==

===Age of Apocalypse and the Exiles===
In an alternate universe in Marvel Comics depicted in the "[[Age of Apocalypse]]" storyline there is a vastly different version of Sabretooth. This version of the character has the same origin as the one in the normal continuity, but has a different moral alignment. He is actually one of the X-Men and a role model for other mutants in this alternate reality. This Sabretooth was initially a villain, having been recruited by Apocalypse, but he was cast out as a traitor when he expressed moral reservations about using nuclear weapons to wipe out the world's human population. Apocalypse intended to kill Sabretooth alongside the X-Men, but was thwarted by Magneto.<ref>''X-Men Chronicles'' #1 (1995). Marvel Comics.</ref> Sabretooth came back into Apocalypse's fold and took part in a number of culls, but he eventually grew disgusted by his life and rebelled against [[Holocaust (Marvel Comics)|Holocaust]], for which he was imprisoned alongside the feral Wild Child. Instead of becoming a feral killer, like Holocaust intended, Sabretooth defeated Wild Child and became his master and protector. Together, the two escaped and joined the X-Men afterward.<ref>''X-Men: Age of Apocalypse One Shot'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> He became a [[hero]] and an ally of Logan (Weapon X), and even [[adoption|adopted]] a young girl, [[Blink (comics)|Blink]], as his daughter. In the ''[[Exiles (comic book)|Exiles]]'' comics, he spent decades in an alternate dimension raising mutant children, attempting to teach them [[ethics]] and tolerance, without incident.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Also, this version of Sabretooth's biological son was theorized to be [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], evidenced by the statement of Mystique that she had gone to the trouble of "finding a father with fur" when Nightcrawler complains he is cold and, when the [[Shadow King]] possesses Mystique, the captions reveal "one memory is more interesting then the others" and flashes to Sabretooth taunting Nightcrawler.<ref>''X-Calibre'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When the "Age of Apocalypse" timeline was apparently destroyed, Sabretooth became the leader of the extra-dimensional band of characters who slide into alternate realities, known as [[Weapon X (Exiles)|Weapon X]]. For a time he was also the leader of their counterpart team, the Exiles, and remains with the team to this day. This version of Sabretooth originally had no adamantium in his skeleton (though it was later revealed that his skeleton had become laced with adamantium like Wolverine), but was still superhumanly strong and possessed a regenerative healing factor."<ref>''Exiles'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Sabretooth decided to leave Weapon X, he stayed behind in a dimension to ensure that that reality's version of David Richards, the son of [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]] and [[Rachel Summers]], would not be corrupted by his virtually [[omnipotence|omnipotent]] powers. However, the boy turned evil anyway, despite Sabretooth's best efforts at raising him right.<ref>''Exiles'' vol. 2 #59. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When he was recruited by the [[Timebroker]] into the Exiles, Blink's personality became incredibly docile and subservient to Creed. Sabretooth gladly took the leadership role from Blink, a fact that [[Mimic (comics)|Mimic]] clashed with him over multiple times. He continued to assist the Exiles in the race to catch [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|Proteus]]. He survived being teleported into outer space by Blink (albeit by accident). After Proteus' defeat, Sabretooth stayed with the team to help fix the multiverse.<ref>''Exiles'' vol. 2 #82. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, when the Exiles needed to defeat the [[Silver Surfer]], this version temporarily becomes a [[Herald of Galactus]]. He uses the powers he gained to maul the Silver Surfer, then after he no longer needed it he returned the [[Power Cosmic]] to [[Galactus]].<ref>''Exiles'' vol. 2 #88. Marvel Comics.</ref>

At Sabretooth's request, Heather unhinges Psylocke from [[Earth-616]] to join the Exiles in [[Power Princess]]' place as she might be their only chance if Proteus ever resurfaces. However, upon arrival, she clashes with Sabretooth, thinking him to be the Earth-616 Sabretooth that nearly killed her twice. They fight for a while, but eventually Psylocke catches on to the fact that Sabretooth is not there for a fight and [[Kevin Sydney|Morph]] intervenes and makes an introduction. Surprisingly, Psylocke cannot be detected by any of Panoptichron's cameras.<ref>''Exiles'' vol. 2 #91. Marvel Comics.</ref> Heather teleports Morph, Sabretooth, and Psylocke down to Earth-1720 to save the other Exiles, who are beaten or brainwashed, courtesy of this world's [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Madame Hydra]], [[Invisible Woman|Sue Storm]]. He and the other Exiles save their brainwashed friends after fighting them.<ref>''Exiles'' vol. 2 #92-94. Marvel Comics.</ref> Sabretooth then returns to an empty Panoptichron. He and Psylocke have been getting closer since their fight. It was later revealed on their first mission of the Exiles with Sabretooth as the new team leader, that his skeleton was now laced with adamantium, though exactly how this happened has yet to be revealed, as he never been previously shown to have had any such enhancements.{{Issue|date=September 2009}} Sabretooth was lost along with Mystique, Valeria, Sage, Rogue, and Gambit (most of the New Exiles team) when they were immersed within the Crystal Palace.<ref>''Exiles'' vol. 2 #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Apparently Blink and the new team of Exiles had found a way to reverse the process as Sabretooth has since been returned to the Age of Apocalypse, since he and Wild Child are seen following and confronting the X-Force from Earth-616.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> After teaming with X-Force to save Archangel, most of the AoA X-Men are killed. [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] stays on Earth-616 to join X-Force while Sabretooth returns to AoA with the only other survivor, Jean Grey. There, they face off against Weapon Omega, formerly this world's Logan and Jean Grey's husband. In an attempt to recreate the [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]] with clones of the [[Scarlet Witch]],<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #19.1. Marvel Comics.</ref> both Jean and Sabretooth end up powerless. They go on the run with the X-Terminated,<ref>''Age of Apocalypse'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> and Sabretooth was injured a while later fighting Weapon Omega while saving Jean.<ref>''Age of Apocalypse'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref> In the months that followed, his son Graydon, also known as Horror Show, patched him up physically and the two made their peace. During the X-Termination crossover, AoA Nightcrawler's trip home resulted in the release of three evil beings that destroy anyone they touch. Several casualties resulted, including the AoA's Sabretooth, Horror Show, and Fiend, as well as the X-Treme X-Men's Xavier and Hercules.<ref>''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' #60 (2013). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Earth X===
In another alternate reality, [[Earth X]], Sabretooth was a member of a Hominid race of half-men, half-beast creatures known as the Bear Clan (along with the Wendigo spirit), who were staunch opponents of the Moon Clan, of which Wolverine was a member (along with Wild Child, Sasquatch, and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]).{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===House of M===
In the [[House of M]] alternate reality created by [[Scarlet Witch]], Sabretooth is a messenger/assassin sent by Magneto. He was dispatched to assassinate Graydon Creed.<ref>''Civil War: House of M'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Magneto sent Sabretooth to deliver a threat to Black Panther. After a short fight, Black Panther decapitates Sabretooth with a vibranium sword, then returns the head to Magneto. It is unknown as to whether or not the head was reunited with the body at a later stage, but this seems unlikely due to later events.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Marvel Noir===
In the ''[[Wolverine Noir]]'' series, this version of Sabretooth is only known by his name, Victor Creed, who owns a hotel named "The Puritan" as well as a boxing club called "Victory Boxing" in the southeast of the [[Bowery]], which was used to get kids off the street. Logan's partner, Dog, mentioned Creed in the Puritan after he disappeared. Logan, expected by Victor, goes to the boxing club and the two fight; Victor beats him and has his body thrown into the alley, where [[Yuriko Oyama|Yuriko]]'s body was also lying.<ref>''Wolverine Noir'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Victor and his thugs capture Logan after he passes out outside of a bar,<ref>''Wolverine Noir'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> taking him to the train yards where Rose and Mariko are waiting with Dog tied to the train tracks. Rose reveals that she had Victor bring Logan and Dog here so that she could get revenge on them. Dog is run over by a train during this conversation and Rose shoots Mariko in the head so she could not betray them to help Logan, which makes Logan kill her and her thugs. Victor runs off during the fight, wishing Rose "good luck in hell".<ref>''Wolverine Noir'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Marvel Zombies===
Sabretooth, as a [[zombie]], is one of a group of zombie villains who team together to try to devour the visiting [[Galactus#Marvel Zombies|Galactus]]. They manage to hurt the cosmic being, but are thrown off their goal by zombie "heroes", [[Alternative versions of Wolverine#Marvel Zombies|Wolverine]] being one of them. In the course of the battle, Wolverine decapitates Sabretooth.<ref>''Marvel Zombies'' Vol. 1 #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Mutant X===
In this reality, a feral Sabretooth roams the Canadian Wilderness with feral versions of Wolverine and Wild Child who help make up "The Pack".{{issue|date=January 2014}} Near the end of the series he breaks off from "the Pack" rejoining up with Weapon X to bring back Wolverine.{{issue|date=January 2014}} After kidnapping Wolverine's family Wolverine confronts him and kills him by chopping his head off.<ref>''Mutant X'' #29. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Old Man Logan===
{{expand section|date=July 2022}}

===Ultimate Marvel===
[[File:Ultimate universe Sabretooth.jpg|upright|thumb|The [[Ultimate Marvel]] depiction of Sabretooth]]
The [[Ultimate Marvel Universe]] depiction of Sabretooth is a mutant soldier and [[commando]] for Weapon X, under the direction of a man by the name of [[Kestrel (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Colonel Wraith]] who referred to him as "a poor man's Wolverine". He appears to be the only mutant who enlisted in the program by choice, due to his high-ranking position and his high authority in the operations. He is practically the same as the Earth-616 version of Sabretooth, having accelerated healing and keen senses, with the exception that he has four adamantium claws surgically implanted in each arm in an attempt to one-up [[Wolverine (Ultimate Marvel character)|Wolverine]] after having many failures in the service of Weapon X. One of the adamantium claws implanted in his left forearm is broken.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #12 (January 2002). Marvel Comics.</ref> Exactly how and when this occurred has not been revealed. He has a burning hatred for Wolverine and also, as he stated in his encounter with him at Weapon X, for the primitive Homo sapiens. He feels that his cruel, psychopathic nature was merely a natural part of being a mutant. When [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Magneto]] attempted to destroy the world so that he could eradicate humans, Sabretooth asked him to kill as few animals as possible.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #30 (May 2003). Marvel Comics.</ref>

He cruelly boasts of murdering Wolverine's wife and child, and then commenced battle with him outside the Weapon X compound. He initially had the upper hand, but Wolverine managed to score a critical hit, a stab to Sabretooth's groin, before driving him off the edge of a cliff.{{issue|date=January 2014}}

Following Sabretooth's loss to Wolverine, the Weapon X program was dismantled with Colonel Wraith being shot dead by [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]]. Sabretooth did not die from his encounter with Wolverine, but rather returned as a high-ranking follower to Magneto in the Brotherhood of Mutants. His encounter with Wolverine while with the Brotherhood was his final underestimation of his old enemy. After boasting that he can survive any wound or injury, and would always return to fight and haunt Wolverine, Wolverine gives a vicious retort: he decapitates Sabretooth on the spot, although the panel was partially covered, so that the full effect of the injury was not visible.{{issue|date=January 2014}}

Sabretooth was long thought dead until he resurfaces one night when Wolverine and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Storm]] were leaving Nowhere Special (a [[billiard hall|pool hall]]). He is alive and well sporting a new scar around his neck, apparently from the decapitation he received from Wolverine when they last met. Sabretooth explains that his head had remained partially attached to his body via strands of tissue and blood vessels, which allowed him to survive in a comatose state while his body regenerated. He also made one startling revelation: Wolverine is his biological father. Sabretooth then attempts to obtain a tissue sample so that [[Abraham Cornelius#Ultimate Marvel|Dr. Cornelius]] can clone a new Wolverine. During the beginning of the "Aftermath" arc, Sabretooth tells Wolverine that he is Wolverine's son.{{issue|date=January 2014}} He also wants to help Wolverine search for his wife, Sabretooth's mother, although Wolverine claims that his scent proves that this is not true.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/dor/ultimate-x-men/740877/images/ultimate-x-men-20071213052440565.html Ultimate X-Men profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615081520/http://comics.ign.com/dor/ultimate-x-men/740877/images/ultimate-x-men-20071213052440565.html |date=2011-06-15 }} at IGN</ref>

Sabretooth made a one-panel cameo in the "Magical" arc, standing outside the Xavier Institute while hiding behind a tree, with a look of sorrow on his face.{{issue|date=January 2014}}

In ''[[Ultimates|Ultimates 3]]''<ref>''Ultimates 3'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> and ''[[Ultimatum (comics)|Ultimatum]]'', Sabretooth is shown to use his claws as weapons (like the main Marvel Universe version of Sabretooth) instead of his four adamantium claws. No canon explanation has been given for this change. Sabretooth alongside Juggernaut were recruited by Rogue and Wraith to help fight Magneto. He kills [[Warren Worthington III#Ultimate Marvel|Angel]], before being shot in the eye by [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)#Ultimate Marvel|Hawkeye]].<ref>''Ultimatum'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> In ''Ultimatum'' #5, he is shown pulling Mystique off of Magneto's citadel before the lower levels explode. They are later seen as part of [[Quicksilver (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Quicksilver]]'s new Brotherhood in [[Wundagore]].<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Ultimate X'' #1-5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Sabretooth later sported a feline appearance when he fought [[Electro (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Electro]] over something that involved [[Green Goblin (Ultimate Marvel character)|Norman Osborn]]. Their fight was broken up by [[Miles Morales|Spider-Man]] with help from [[Cloak and Dagger (characters)#Ultimate Marvel|Cloak and Dagger]].<ref>''Miles Morales: Ultimate Spider-Man'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===X-Men Forever===
In, ''X-Men Forever'', Chris Claremont's continuation of his run on ''X-Men'' (non-canonical to the mainstream timeline and taking place in the 161 Marvel Universe), Sabretooth is established as Wolverine's father.{{issue|date=December 2010}} He attacks the X-Mansion, but is blinded by Storm,<ref name="X-Men Forever #2"/> as well as losing one hand and having his healing factor shut down.{{Issue|date=May 2012}} He subsequently joins the X-Men to honor his son, using his still-enhanced senses to compensate for his lack of vision, and a bionic replacement for his hand.{{Issue|date=May 2012}} It is also revealed that the Sabretooth that fought alongside the Marauders is a clone made by Sinister; the true Sabretooth, while initially villainous, is less psychotic and as such is able to truly reform. The two Sabretooths do battle on one occasion.{{issue|date=May 2014}}

===X-Factor Forever===
Sabretooth appears in [[Louise Simonson]] and [[Dan Panosian]]'s five issue run on ''X-Factor Forever''.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

===Age of X===
In the ''[[Age of X]]'' reality, it was revealed that Sabretooth has been captured by the Sapiens League and paraded down the streets as a dangerous mutant as shown in Tempo's memory.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #245. Marvel Comics.</ref> He was later used by the Avengers to track other mutants- his jaw removed and replaced with metal joints, his words suggesting that whatever caused this injury left him with brain damage - under the codename 'Weapon S', but the [[Alternative versions of Hulk#Age of X|Hulk]] kills him after leading them to the fortress as his head is crushed.<ref>''Age of X Universe'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Wolverine MAX===
In the 2012 series ''Wolverine MAX'', Logan is shown to be living in Japan as a monk when he first meets a blond, older man calling himself "Victor". Victor tells Logan that he is "just like him". When Logan refuses to accept Victor's claim as truth, Victor responds by saying "Okay then, I'll just have to prove it", before hurling the former into a nearby tree, proving his superhuman strength.<ref>''Wolverine MAX'' (Vol.1) #01 (December 2012). p. 17. panel 6, and p. 18. panel 1-2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

{{Main|List of Thor enemies}}

==Love interests==
Thor has had several notable romances throughout his long history:

*'''[[Sif (comics)|Sif]]''', a warrior based on the deity [[Sif]], is one of Thor's main love interests. However, Thor's draw to Earth has been a constant distraction. Sif did for a time try to live a mortal life on Earth, but found it to be mundane and returned to Asgard. Furthermore, their relationship has suffered from numerous interruptions by other women, particularly Jane Foster, the Enchantress, and Lorelei. Sif and Thor, however, have always found a way to rekindle their romance. After the events of Ragnarok, Thor was able to restore every Asgardian with the exception of Sif, whose spirit was trapped inside the body of a dying elderly woman. Thor eventually was able to restore Sif as well, just before the elderly woman died.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 3, #1-12,#600-602</ref>
*'''[[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]]''', a nurse, was involved in a love triangle with Thor and Dr. Donald Blake, not knowing they were one.

Disapproving, Odin strips Jane of her newly acquired powers, returns her to Earth without memories of Asgard, where she marries Dr. Keith Kinkaid and has a child. Much later, Dr. Donald Blake returns to Earth after emerging from the void of nonexistence and encounters Jane, who has since divorced Dr. Kinkaid. After a rocky exchange, the two agree to go on a date.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 3, #8,#11</ref>
*'''[[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|The Enchantress]]''' is one of Thor's most notable antagonists and lovers. Since her introduction, Amora, The Enchantress, has often tried to use her magic to seduce Thor and eliminate her competition for Thor's affections. However, Thor did form a willing romance with Amora during a vulnerable state when Odin abandoned him without his powers on Earth.<ref>''Thor'' #491-494</ref> This relationship reached its pinnacle when Thor assumed the throne of Asgard and took the Enchantress as his bride. Amora helped Thor create a dark future in which they ruled Asgard and Earth with an iron fist and even had a child, [[Magni (Marvel Comics)|Magni]]. However, this was all undone when Thor traveled back in time to prevent this future from occurring.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #68-79</ref>
*'''[[Shawna Lynde]]''', a fellow doctor of Donald Blake's. Both had supposedly graduated from medical school together. Shawna had an open crush on Blake, but was unaware of his connection as Thor. She too was briefly caught in a love triangle between herself Blake and Sif, however she was unaware of Sif's identity and thought that she was Blake's cousin 'Sybil'.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 1, #328-329</ref> When Donald Blake ceased to exist, she became concerned, but had her memory wiped by Fandral.

*'''[[Lorelei (Asgardian)|Lorelei]]''', like her sister Amora, the Enchantress, has also used magic to gain the affections of Thor. Loki persuaded Lorelei into giving Thor an elixir that would cause him to fall in love with her. Loki hoped Lorelei could then use her influence over Thor to gain his support for Loki's bid for the throne of Asgard. However, the Enchantress jealously cast a spell of her own, which caused Lorelei to fall in love with Loki. [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]] in turn used this to expose Thor to their plot.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 1, #357-359</ref>
*'''[[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Brunnhilde]]''' the [[valkyrie]] attempted (to no avail) to save the life of Thor, who was incarnated as [[Sigmund]] against Odin's wishes. Brunnhilde ''was'', however, able to keep Sigmund's pregnant wife, Sieglinde, from harm. As punishment, Odin removed Brunnhilde's powers and cast her into a deep sleep. Brunnhilde is eventually awakened by Thor, who reincarnated as [[Sigurd|Siegfried]], the son of Sigmund and Sieglinde. Brunnhilde and Siegfried become lovers, but Siegfried, under the influence of magic, betrays her. When Siegfried is killed, Brunnhilde, who is still in love with him, jumps into his blazing funeral pyre. Odin, so moved by these events, fully restores both Brunnhilde and Thor but wipes their memories.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 1, #296-300</ref>
*'''[[She-Hulk]]''', during the battle against the Dark [[Celestials]], Jennifer Walters became romantically involved with Thor,<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 8 #8.

==Fictional team history==
===First Zodiac (human)===
The original Zodiac group debuts in the title the ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]''<ref name="Avengers #72 (Jan. 1970)">''The Avengers'' #72 (Jan. 1970)</ref> and is established as a [[criminal]] organization founded and funded by member Cornelius van Lunt (who adopts the identity of [[Taurus (comics)|Taurus]]). The group's identity is based on the [[Western zodiac]] from [[astrology]], with each member adopting the persona of a sign of the zodiac, being twelve in all. The group members share leadership of the organization, with the position rotating just as the astrological zodiac changes. When not united as a group, the members of Zodiac are all based in different cities throughout the [[United States]]. Dedicated to [[economic]] and [[political]] domination of the world, the group uses any means to accomplish this, including [[Subversion (politics)|subversion]]; [[extortion]] and [[mass murder]].

Lone member [[Scorpio (Marvel Comics)|Scorpio]] is the first member to debut in the Marvel Universe, first appearing in the title ''[[Nick Fury]], Agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''<ref>''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #1 (June 1968). Marvel Comics.</ref> The character acquires a [[Sentience|sentient]] [[Parallel universe (fiction)|extradimensional]] (from the ''Ankh'' dimension) [[Magic item|artifact]] called the '''Zodiac Key''', and attempts to assassinate S.H.I.E.L.D. director [[Nick Fury]]. The encounter ends with Scorpio apparently dying from a [[gunshot]] wound. The character reappears in the same title, and attempts to kill Fury once again, before being driven off by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.<ref>''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #5 (Oct. 1968). Marvel Comics.</ref> It is eventually revealed that this was still the original villain, but [[resurrect]]ed in a [[Life Model Decoy]] body by the Zodiac Key.

Scorpio appears in the title ''Avengers'' and, after capturing the Avengers, reveals to the heroes the entire Zodiac. At this time [[Aries (comics)|Aries]] is team leader, and takes control of the Zodiac Key and acknowledges that Scorpio has redeemed himself for failing to kill Nick Fury. The Avengers are freed by fellow members [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]] and the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], and Scorpio is revealed to be Nick Fury in disguise. The villains flee, and Fury reveals that after learning that the original Scorpio was his brother, Jake Fury, he adopted the identity to draw out the other Zodiac members.<ref name="Avengers #72 (Jan. 1970)"/>

The Zodiac reappear in ''Avengers'', with member Taurus attempting to [[extort]] local [[farmer]]s for their land.

Marvel Comics.</ref> The attempt fails, and the Spymaster is contracted to capture Daredevil in revenge for his past interference. The Spymaster succeeds, and also captures [[mercenary]] [[Madame Masque]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #73 (Feb. 1971).

Nighthawk's teammates, the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] track Scorpio and encounter the android Zodiac.

In a plot to rule Earth, he had special suits made for the ambitious people that want to rule the world with one of them being [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s cousin [[John King (comics)|John King]] who became Cancer.<ref>''Avengers Assemble'' vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Thanos abandoned his Zodiac on the self-destructing Helicarrier, John King was the only one who survived and was interrogated about Thanos' plot. According to Captain America about the identity of some of the Zodiac members, he mentioned one of the Zodiac members was a former bodyguard of [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]], another Zodiac member formerly worked for [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]], and another was a [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] agent. Though Captain America did not say which of the Zodiac members were associated with these identities.<ref>''Avengers Assemble'' vol. 2 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Zodiac Sects===
As part of the "[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]", a new incarnation of the Zodiac appears. This version has their Sects named after their Zodiac symbol. Their Leo Sect was shown speeding down the highways of [[Shanghai]], [[China]] as they are being pursued by [[Spider-Man]] and [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] in his new Spider-Mobile. Mockingbird told [[Nick Fury, Jr.]] that the Zodiac broke into Parker Industries' Shanghai branch and stole some servers which would allow them to hack into the Webware devices. As they swerve to avoid energy bolts, Spider-Man boasts of his superior driving skills. In the driver's seat of the Zodiacs' getaway car, Leo tells his Leo Sect grunts to take out the road. The Zodiac thugs blow up a car, destroying the road, but as they gloat the Spider-Mobile tails them, driving along the underside of the overpass. Cheered on by the citizens of Shanghai, Spider-Man switches the steering over to Mockingbird and opens the roof, addressing his fans in Mandarin, which he picked up taking his driving lessons. The Spider-Mobile's wheels unfold into insectoid legs and it flips over, cutting off the Zodiacs' escape. Spider-Man jumps onto the hood of their car, displaying a couple of the new webbing types he developed: micro-coiled Z-metal "Bug Zappers" capable of being electrified, and shock-absorbing expanding web-foam. The Zodiacs' car crashes and Spider-Man checks on the citizens to see if anyone is hurt. When one of them reprimands him for letting Zodiac's Leo Sect escape, Spider-Man states he is delegating their apprehension to Mockingbird, who knocks the grunts out and interrogates Leo as to why Zodiac has been trying to steal the Webware servers. Leo bites a suicide pill, but Spider-Man shoots him with an antidote he developed griping that he is tired of them killing themselves. Later on at [[Max Modell]] and Hector Baez' wedding, Zodiac's Pisces Sect emerges from the river. While Peter offers himself up as a distraction, [[Prowler (Marvel Comics)|Hobie Brown]] changes into his Spider-Man costume. The leader of the Pisces Sect reveals they are after Peter's Webware specifically, because it has access to restricted data caches. Disguised as Spider-Man, Hobie intervenes and Peter tells Sajani to help the wedding guests (who are former Horizon Labs employees) find cover. Hobie's lack of a Spider-Sense gets him knocked out of the fight and Peter realizes that he could be killed. Encrypting his Webware, he gives it to the Pisces Sect, who depart as the police arrive.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Spider-Man and the Prowler infiltrate the Aquarius Sect's underwater base as Pisces, Aquarius, and Cancer work to decrypt the Webware. When Spider-Man and the Prowler engage the three Zodiac members, Pisces uses her water powers on them as Pisces, Aquarius, and Cancer escape upon setting their underwater base to self-destruct. Spider-Man and the Prowler recover the Webware and exit the underwater base while Pisces, Aquarius, and Cancer exit in the escape pods. While contacting Mockingbird and Nick Fury Jr. of their status, Spider-Man learns that Leo is still being interrogated and has not snitched yet. Spider-Man says that they forced the Zodiac to send the encrypted data to all the Zodiac bases and sends Fury the location of all the Zodiac bases. Nick Fury Jr. states that they can now take the fight to the Zodiac before they can begin their next plot.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

At the Zodiac's headquarters, Scorpio learns from Gemini that if the Zodiac keeps taking risks, then S.H.I.E.L.D. will win. Scorpio tells Aries and Taurus that they are moving out and to round up their troops. When Aries asks if he wants the best and brightest or red shirts, Scorpio states cannon fodder will suffice and that if they want results, they cannot care about the risks. The Zodiac later attacks a S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier at the East China Sea where Mockingbird claims to Nick Fury Jr. that Scorpio might be his uncle. Scorpio breaks into the holding area where Leo is being held. Leo informs him that he did not tell S.H.I.E.L.D. anything. Scorpio applauds Leo's loyalty to the cause, but states that the attack was not a rescue mission. As Leo expresses confusion, Scorpio blasts him with the Zodiac Key, reducing his body to a pile of ashes as he coldly states that Leo failed his mission and failed to kill himself. Scorpio then orders the Zodiac troops to retreat into the ocean where the Pisces Sect's ships are waiting.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In an unknown location, Scorpio and the Geminis are looking at the stars. The Geminis tell Scorpio that if he goes on with his plans, he will succeed. If he forces S.H.I.E.L.D.'s hand tonight, their ally Spider-Man will abandon them. Scorpio decides to strike now and tells them to inform all their houses that it is time. During this time, S.H.I.E.L.D., Human Torch, and the Prowler are preparing to attack the Zodiac bases. While Nick Fury Jr. is annoyed that Spider-Man was detoured about the Goblin Nation's War Goblins attack on Nadua, S.H.I.E.L.D. begins attacking the Zodiac bases where nobody has found Scorpio yet.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

It was later revealed that the Zodiac bases that were attacked were all fake. There was even a mentioning that S.H.I.E.L.D. was unable to remove Leo's mask. At the British Museum, Scorpio and the Zodiac storm the place, being spotted by a camera. Scorpio is using the Zodiac Key to look for his price when Spider-Man, the Human Torch, Mockingbird and the Prowler crash through a window and the heroes and various S.H.I.E.L.D. agents fight the Zodiac. Spider-Man and Mockingbird go after Scorpio, but are stopped by Sagittarius who claims to be the world greatest archer. While Mockingbird takes care of him, Spider-Man confronts Scorpio, who destroys the Rosetta Stone and takes what is inside: a strange artifact with the Zodiac Key symbol. Scorpio tells him that the game is over now, meaning he has no use for his pawns and uses a Webware to activate the venom samples in all of the Zodiac members. Spider-Man jumps into action and manages to hit all of the Zodiac with the antidote before they die while Scorpio uses this moment to escape. The Zodiac Key is held in the apartment of a man named Mr. Jacobs alongside his Scorpio gear.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When the planets that are shown in the Zodiac Grand Orrery get into alignment, Scorpio traveled back to his base in France. Spider-Man tracked the hacked satellite signal back to Vernon Jacobs' building. While in the Channel Tunnel, he transformed two of its staff members into becoming his next Cancer and Leo. While Spider-Man called his allies, Scorpio crashed the transmission stating that he will use his influence on Parker Industries enough to have it sink into the ground.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

On his way to the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, Scorpio transforms two other people into Pisces and Taurus. At the Royal Observatory, Scorpio places the Zodiac Grand Orrery in the prime meridian there and performed a ritual that opened a secret passageway underground. Spider-Man and his allies arrived to stop Scorpio. When Scorpio steps into the door, he sees a year filled with events like Skyspear, [[Norman Osborn]]'s latest activity, [[Regent (comics)|Regent]]'s plot, the [[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy|"New U" device]], [[Doctor Octopus]]' return, and another [[Civil War II|superhuman civil war]], and the [[Monsters Unleashed (comics)|rise of the monsters]]. Catching Scorpio off guard, Spider-Man punched Scorpio into the doorway and locked it up. As Spider-Man suspects that Scorpio will have been teleported one year into the future, this would give S.H.I.E.L.D. time to prepare for Scorpio's return.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Solo Zodiac===
A solo character called ''Zodiac'' stars in a self-titled limited series as part of the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline. The character is obsessed with dominating the criminal underworld. He ends up gaining allies in the [[Clown (comics)|Clown]] II, the Death Reaper, Manslaughter Marsdale, and the [[Trapster]]. After they commit mass murder on 100 [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] Agents, Zodiac eventually retrieves the Zodiac Key from [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]<ref>''Dark Reign: Zodiac'' #1-3 (Aug.-Oct. 2009). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Zodiac later makes plans for a series of impressive-sounding schemes to put into motion in the near future.<ref>''Age of Heroes'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

It is later revealed that Zodiac was the mysterious benefactor of the [[Young Masters]]. When [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Egghead]] II is the only one that has not left the group, Zodiac recruits him into his villain army.<ref>''Vengeance'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Great Wheel of Zodiac===
A short-lived Zodiac team known as The Great Wheel was revealed to have existed back in 1961. The team was formed by a time traveling [[Leonardo da Vinci]] who takes on the Aries mantle. He recruits members that fill out different nations and organizations with the intent to perform certain missions in exchange for special acquirements that could be used for their personal battles. The rest of the Zodiac members consisted of [[Taurus (comics)#Cornelius Van Lunt|Cornelius Van Lunt]] (Taurus), Nick Fury (Gemini), Jake Fury (Scorpio), [[Dum Dum Dugan]] (Libra), [[John Garrett (comics)|John Garrett]] (Aquarius), [[Daniel Whitehall]] (Leo), [[Baron Strucker|Wolfgang von Strucker]] (Sagittarius), Thomas Davidson (Virgo), Shoji Soma (Pisces), Vasili Dassaiev (Capricorn) and Viktor Uvarov (Cancer). After completing their missions and collecting the items needed, Dassaiev and Uvarov betrayed the members and stole them to enhance themselves. These events would lead into the creation of both [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] and [[Leviathan (Marvel Comics)|Leviathan]] and S.H.I.E.L.D.'s creation of the [[Life Model Decoy]]s.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #25 (May 2011).

* Zodiac appears in ''[[Marvel Anime|Marvel Anime: Iron Man]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} This version of the group is a terrorist organization affiliated with [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]], which lets them employ advanced technology based on their astrological symbols, such as [[Scorpio (Marvel Comics)|Scorpio]], Cancer, [[Aquarius (Marvel Comics)|Aquarius]], and [[Sagittarius (comics)|Sagittarius]]-themed mechs, and others, as well as energy weapons, mind control technology, and cybernetics. Their membership consists of [[Ho Yinsen]], who was influenced by Zodiac after losing his family to war and wears stolen [[Iron Man]] Dio armor; Dr. '''Chika Tanaka''', a scientist and close associate of [[Tony Stark]]'s who was brainwashed into becoming their sleeper agent [[Gemini (Marvel Comics)|Gemini]]; and the organization's mysterious leader '''Kuroda''', Japan's Minister of Defense.

Heroes for Hire would not accept jobs that involved extralegal activities.{{issue|date=November 2015}}

** Jeri appears in the [[Iron Fist (season 1)|first season]] of ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]''. It is revealed that before starting Hogarth Chao & Benowitz, she interned in the legal department at Rand Enterprises, where she held a distrust for [[Harold Meachum]]. Danny nicknamed her "J-Money", and also recounts that she once bribed him $5 to keep quiet after he overheard her throwing a profane rant at his father's secretary. After Harold killed Danny's parents in a staged plane crash, Jeri took care of the Rand family's graves and cared for their estate.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Rolling Thunder Cannon Punch|series=Marvel's Iron Fist|credits=Shankland, Tom (director); Quinton Peeples (writer)|network=[[Netflix]]|airdate=March 17, 2017|season=1|number=3}}</ref> Soon after his return to New York City, Danny seeks out Jeri. She offers to help him prove his identity and takes his case ''pro bono'' out of respect for his father - on the condition he put her law firm on permanent retainer with Rand Enterprises if they succeed in arbitration with [[Ward Meachum|Ward]] and [[Joy Meachum]]. Jeri attends a press conference staged by Ward (on Harold's advice) to announce Danny's return to the public. She later arranges for paperwork to be sent to Danny for him to sign.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Eight Diagram Dragon Palm|series=Marvel's Iron Fist|credits=Sapochnik, Miguel (director); Scott Reynolds (writer)|network=[[Netflix]]|airdate=March 17, 2017|season=1|number=4}}</ref> After Harold frames Danny for the Hand's drug smuggling, Ward reaches out to Jeri to help clear Danny's name.

[[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]] is later sent by Danny and Colleen to summon Jeri to a rendezvous with Danny and Collen, where she informs them about the charges against them and suggests that they prove their innocence. Following Harold's death, Jeri is present with Danny and Ward when they have Harold's body cremated so that he can't be brought back to life.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Dragon Plays with Fire|series=Marvel's Iron Fist|credits=Surjik, Stephen (director); Scott Buck, Tamara Becher-Wilkinson and Pat Charles (writer)|network=[[Netflix]]|airdate=March 17, 2017|season=1|number=13}}</ref>

**In the [[Jessica Jones (season 3)|third season]], Jeri again avoids prison despite her role in Shane's murder, but her ALS worsens to the point that she briefly becomes suicidal, asking Jessica to kill her, but she changes her mind. When [[Patsy Walker|Trish Walker]] begins acting as the masked vigilante Hellcat and targets serial killer [[Foolkiller|Gregory Sallinger]], Jeri offers a bounty on Trish's head, as Sallinger is one of her clients. She reconnects with an old flame, Kith Lyonne, who she cheated on with Wendy but never stopped loving and who is now married to Peter Lyonne. Jeri seduces Kith into an affair, but Kith reveals that she and Peter are in an open marriage since their daughter's death and Peter is also having affairs. When Kith refuses to leave Peter, Jeri retaliates by discovering evidence of Peter's fraudulent activities and releasing them, resulting in Peter committing suicide while revealing on a video that Jeri is involved with superpowered people. Kith initially blames Jeri for tearing her family apart for selfish reasons, but soon turns to her for legal advice when one of her former business partners threatens to send Kith to prison for Peter's fraud. In desperation, Jeri asks Trish to find leverage on the partner, promising not to reveal her identity in the process. Trish, however, believes that Jeri asked her to kill the partner, and turns on Jeri instead, holding Kith hostage. Jessica intervenes in the ensuing confrontation, but Jeri begs Trish to release Kith, promising to get her out of the country while shooting Jessica in the leg. After Jessica tracks down and defeats Trish, Jeri tries to reconcile with Kith, but her ALS symptoms show even more to the point that her hands begin shaking, forcing Jeri to confess that she is dying. Kith subsequently discovers that Jeri only sabotaged her marriage with Peter, ruined her family and seduced her only so that she would have company during her final years, regardless of the impact it would have on Kith. Finally realizing how selfish and evil Jeri truly is, Kith abandons her to die alone.

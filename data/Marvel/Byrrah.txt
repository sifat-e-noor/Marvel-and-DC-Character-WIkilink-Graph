'''''Homo mermanus''''' is a fictional race of [[gill]]ed aquatic [[humanoid]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. This race is best known as the inhabitants of [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]] in the [[Marvel Universe]]. [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] is the most notable character representative of the race. [[Bill Everett]] often called them submariners and Prince Namor, the Sub-Mariner, but [[Stan Lee]] began to call everyone Atlanteans and the undersea kingdom Atlantis.

An offshoot of the ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' species with an as-yet undisclosed origin, ''Homo mermanus'' is a [[mammal]]ian species, but with some [[fish]]-like characteristics. Each one possesses two twin gills located on their necks near the [[clavicle]] bone, which allow them to breathe underwater. Their skin pigmentation can be either blue (most Atlanteans) or green (most Lemurians and nomads).

Their physiology is also much stronger and more durable than that of the ''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]'', created by their exposure to the vast pressure of the deep sea. As a consequence, they are physically much stronger than regular humans and can swim up to 30 miles (48&nbsp;km) per hour. The typical lifespan for a ''Homo mermanus'' is 150 years. However, they cannot survive outside of water for longer than five minutes without aid.

The total population of ''Homo mermanus'' has been estimated at over 1,000,000 globally.  {{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Atlanteans first appeared in ''Motion Picture Funnies Weekly'' #1 (April 1939).

==Fictional race history==
The ''Homo mermanus'' are often referred to as ''Atlanteans'', as it is in the city of [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]] that their first complex [[society]] emerged. Like humans, they learned to domesticate animals, such as dolphins.

Atlantis itself had been a small above ground [[continent]] with many human settlements, when an event 10,000 years ago called the "Great Cataclysm" caused it to be submerged into the sea. 2,000 years later, a group of ''Homo mermanus'' made the ruins of the human settlements in Atlantis their home and went on to develop a society there, using as much of the material as they could scavenge from the wreckage. Many of the warring tribes united under a single emperor (although by the 20th century there were still some barbarian tribes).

500 years after the settlement of Atlantis, another group of ''Homo mermanus'' left Atlantis to found their own city -this time in a part of the ruins of another continent submerged during the Great Cataclysm - [[Lemuria (comics)|Lemuria]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]].

These "Lemurians" would discover the [[Serpent Crown]] in the ruins of their city, and through their Leader [[Naga (Marvel Comics)|Naga]]'s exposure and extensive use of the ancient mystical device, they would become more serpent-like in appearance than their Atlantean cousins.

Many Atlanteans worship [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]], Roman god of the sea.

During the 20th century the ''Homo mermanus'' race began to come into sustained contact with their human cousins. These contacts have often been hostile, and have included many aborted invasions (''[[Atlantis Attacks]]'' etc.) and even separate occasions when large numbers of ''Homo mermanus'' were rendered comatose or sterilized for periods. During the [[World War II|Second World War]] the kingdom of Atlantis also fought against the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis Powers]] in alliance with the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]].{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

However, not all interactions between ''Homo sapiens'' and ''Homo mermanus'' have been hostile - during the 1920s a ''Homo mermanus'' female, Princess Fen of Atlantis mated with the human sea captain Leonard McKenzie - a union which produced the first human/Atlantean hybrid - Namor {avenging son in atlantean}, the Sub-Mariner.{{Issue|date=July 2022}}

In the aftermath of the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] and the [[World War Hulk]] events the ''homo mermanus'', being blamed for the terrorism due to the actions of Kamar, militaristic son of Namor, are forced to leave the seas, using the established sleeper cells to live within humanity.{{Issue|date=November 2009}} The Atlantean Army resided in [[Latveria]], guests of [[Doctor Doom]], and the civilians lived alongside the rest of humanity.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

After their leader Namor allied with the [[X-Men]], the Atlanteans began to build a support pillar that would keep the newly established mutant nation of Utopia (near the coast of San Francisco) from sinking.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #520. Marvel Comics.</ref> Around this pillar, called the Atlantean column, they established a city called New Atlantis.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #521. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As part of the "[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]," Atlantis was later attacked by the [[Squadron Supreme]] in retaliation for Namor and the [[Cabal (comics)|Cabal]] having destroyed the worlds of some of its members. After [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]] beheaded Namor and [[Power Princess]] killed Attuma, the Squadron Supreme recalled the information of Atlantis' previous attacks on the surface world. Hyperion then lifted Atlantis above the ocean and then threw it onto the ground enough to kill the other Atlanteans present.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' Vol 4 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Namor then begins to work to unite the different branches of Atlanteans when it comes to keeping the oceans safe from surface world invaders.<ref name="Namor: The Best Defense #1">''Namor: The Best Defense'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After his failure to get the Vodani on his side, Namor turned his attention towards the Sea Blades faction. Having siphoned the aquakinetic abilities of [[Hydro-Man]], Namor parted the oceans and leaving the Sea Blades and their leader to asphyxiate unless they ceded leadership to him. Their leader Karris agreed to the terms upon being awestruck with Namor's ability.<ref name="Invaders Vol 3 #1">''Invaders'' Vol. 3 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Subraces and branches==
''Homo mermanus'' is divided between the Atlanteans and the splinter group that settled in the sunken continent of Lemuria and took the name of Lemurians. They differed as they possessed a more reptilian greenish skin color compared to the blue-skinned Atlanteans.

The Vodani are a branch of the Atlanteans that have followed a portal in the [[Mindanao Trench]] that took them to a watery planet that they named Vodan.<ref name="Namor: The Best Defense #1"/>

The Sea Blades are a militaristic branch of shock-troopers that defected from Atlantis years ago.<ref name="Invaders Vol 3 #1"/>

In "Beneath the Surface", it is revealed that Attuma's chief adviser Lady Zartra and those with her have gotten tired of Attuma's tyranny and planned to use the [[Serpent Crown]] to control [[Giganto]] into helping them fight against Attuma's army. Following a misunderstanding between Lady Zartra's group and the Avengers, both groups work together to fight Attuma's army when he obtains the Serpent Crown and controls Giganto.

After the bomb is disposed by White Wolf, Attuma works with Black Panther to save the Atlanteans and fix the cracks that the bomb left. By the time Black Panther and Attuma settle their differences, Attuma is fatally attacked by Killmonger using Attuma's trident and dies in Elanna's arms. Black Panther and White Wolf couldn't give a defeated Killmonger to Elanna because of his intel on where the real Black Widow is as the two of them take Killmonger as their prisoner. Elanna's first act as queen is that she released Tiger Shark to assist in her upcoming war with Wakanda.

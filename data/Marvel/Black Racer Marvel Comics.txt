The '''Serpent Society''' is an organization of [[snake]]-themed <!--Do not add "fictional" as it is tautological; supervillains (and characters in general) are by definition implied to be fictionalized to some extent.-->supervillains appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The society is a continuation of the original group the [[Serpent Squad]] and was later changed into '''Serpent Solutions'''. The Serpent Society first appeared in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #310 (October 1985) and was created by writer [[Mark Gruenwald]] and artist [[Paul Neary]].<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |pages=400–401}}</ref> Serpent Solutions first appeared in ''[[Falcon (comics)|Captain America: Sam Wilson]]'' #1 by writer [[Nick Spencer]] and artist [[Daniel Acuña]].

The Serpent Society was formed by [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder]] as he gathered a number of villains with snake-themed powers. The group was organized more like a supervillain [[Trade union|labor union]], with the members providing protection for each other, sharing profits, etc. The Society took jobs for criminal organizations such as [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]], the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]], the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]], and [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] Some of these jobs brought the Serpent Society into conflict with Captain America and his partners. At one point, the [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]] took control of the Society, plotting to take control of the United States, but was ultimately foiled by [[Captain America]], [[Demolition Man (comics)|D-Man]], [[Nomad (comics)#Jack Monroe|Nomad]], the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] and former members of the Serpent Society. The Society would briefly reform over the years, but never made much impact.
 
As part of the [[All-New Marvel NOW!]] branding, a resurrected [[Viper (Marvel Comics)|Viper]] (Jordan Stryke) took control of the Serpent Society. He reorganized it as "Serpent Solutions" and provided their services to various corporations. Serpent Solutions were opposed by the new Captain America, formerly the Falcon.
 
The Serpent Society has appeared in Marvel's ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'' cartoon series as well as the [[Toei Animation|Toei]] [[anime]] series ''[[Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers]]''. The Serpent Society was also part of the ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' video game.

==Concept and creation==
The Serpent Society first appeared in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #310 (Oct. 1985) and was created by [[Mark Gruenwald]] and [[Paul Neary]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=319}}</ref> Serpent Solutions first appeared in ''[[Falcon (comics)|Captain America: Sam Wilson]]'' #1 by writer [[Nick Spencer]] and artist [[Daniel Acuña]].

Most of the villains [[Mark Gruenwald]] introduced in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' were created to symbolize aspects of contemporary American culture and the world political situation. In the case of the Serpent Society, Gruenwald created them to symbolize [[trade union]]s.<ref>{{cite news | first = Dwight Jon | last = Zimmerman | date = January 1988 | title = Mark Gruenwald | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = #54 | page = 15 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}</ref>

==Fictional team history==

===Formation===
The Serpent Society was founded by [[Sidewinder (character)|Sidewinder]], and was a descendant of sorts from the two original [[Serpent Squad]]s. The first Squad consisted of the original [[Viper (Marvel Comics)|Viper]], his brother the original [[Eel (comics)|Eel]], and the [[Cobra (Marvel Comics)|Cobra]]. The second Squad consisted of the second Viper (who was also formerly [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Madame Hydra]]), the Eel, [[Princess Python]], the Cobra, and the Atlantean warlord [[Krang (Marvel Comics)|Krang]]. Sidewinder led the third incarnation of the Squad that included [[Anaconda (character)|Anaconda]], [[Black Mamba (character)|Black Mamba]] and [[Death Adder (character)|Death Adder]]. They were to retrieve the fabled [[Serpent Crown]] from its then-underwater grave.<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #64-65 (1980). Marvel Comics.</ref> Sidewinder used his cloak and abandoned his comrades during an underwater mishap, and proceeded to collect the reward for the Crown.<ref>''Captain America'' #307 (1985). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Anaconda, Mamba and Adder survived and confronted Sidewinder. During that time, Sidewinder had invested the money and started the groundwork for the Serpent Society. The Society was to provide its members with better access to technology, bigger access to jobs, higher pay, comradeship, safe lodging, and a host of other benefits. Most importantly, with Sidewinder's teleportation cloak, members never had to fear imprisonment again. It was, essentially, a supervillain [[Trade union|labor union]].<ref>''Captain America'' #308 (1985). Marvel Comics.</ref>

After persuading his former comrades of his true intention to better their lot (and paying their share of the reward plus interest), he had them contact other snake-themed criminals which included the [[Asp (character)|Asp]], [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]], the [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]], the Cobra, Princess Python, the Viper, the [[Rattler (character)|Rattler]], [[Cottonmouth (Burchell Clemens)|Cottonmouth]], and [[Bushmaster (Marvel Comics)|Bushmaster]]. The Viper refused to attend the first initial gathering. Constrictor, unimpressed with the proceedings, walked out and tried to turn the group over to the Avengers.<ref>''Captain America'' #310 (1985). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Sidewinder, Anaconda, Black Mamba, Death Adder, Asp, Diamondback, Cottonmouth, the Cobra, Bushmaster, Rattler, and Princess Python became charter members of the Serpent Society. They headquartered at Serpent Citadel, which was an abandoned mental hospital located in upstate New York. Sidewinder sent them out to contact various criminal organizations including [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]], the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]], the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]], and [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] From A.I.M. they received their first paying assignment: the elimination of their former leader [[MODOK]].<ref>''Captain America'' #313 (1986). Marvel Comics.</ref> The Society's success in killing MODOK quickly cemented their reputation as criminal talents of the first caliber. [[Captain America]] intervened many times during their early years, but was never able to put them out of commission.<ref>''Captain America'' #315 (1986). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Two charter members soon left the Society. Princess Python fled during the MODOK assignment and was soon after expelled from their ranks. Death Adder was killed by Scourge of the Underworld when he was sent to ransom the Princess to her [[Circus of Crime]] cohorts.<ref>''Captain America'' #318-319 (1986). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, the Viper sent a fourth Serpent Squad (though not named as such) consisting of [[Copperhead (Marvel Comics)|Copperhead]], [[Black Racer (Marvel Comics)|Black Racer]], Fer-de-Lance and [[Puff Adder (comics)|Puff Adder]] to infiltrate the Society with the intention of assassinating Sidewinder and setting herself up as the rightful leader.<ref>''Captain America'' #337-338 (1988). Marvel Comics.</ref> When the four were taken to Serpent Citadel by Sidewinder, it was easy for the rest of the Viper's allies ([[Coachwhip (comics)|Coachwhip]], [[Boomslang (comics)|Boomslang]], [[Slither (comics)|Slither]], and [[Rock Python]]), to assault the place. Many of the charter members went turncoat and supported the Viper, whereas the Asp, Black Mamba, Bushmaster, and Diamondback remained loyal to Sidewinder.<ref>''Captain America'' #341-342 (1988). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Viper used the Society and its resources to poison the water supply of Washington DC, which turned its citizens into snake-men. The ensuing chaos nearly destroyed the capital. Diamondback managed to escape with Sidewinder and solicited help from Captain America (who then was known as "The Captain" while another man donned the Captain America costume and identity) and his allies [[Demolition Man (comics)|Demolition Man]], [[Nomad (comics)#Jack Monroe|Nomad]], the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], and [[Vagabond (comics)|Vagabond]]. The team stormed Serpent Citadel, rescued the Society members that were loyal to Sidewinder, and captured many others. The Viper, however managed to escape.<ref>''Captain America'' #343 (1988). Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the end, Cobra subdued the Viper and turned her over to the Captain on the condition that he allowed the Serpent Society 24 hours to evacuate from their headquarters. When the Captain refused the deal the Cobra turned Viper over anyway.<ref>''Captain America'' #344 (1988). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Bitter over the betrayal, Sidewinder left the Society and the Cobra became its new leader, eventually calling himself King Cobra.<ref>''Captain America'' #365-367 (1989-1990). Marvel Comics.</ref> With the exception of Slither and the Viper herself, all of the Viper's agents remained with the Society. The Society re-located to a new secret headquarters in the Bronx.

===The trial===
Shortly afterwards, Diamondback became romantically involved with Captain America and tried to leave the Society altogether to be with him.<ref>''Captain America'' #371 (1990). Marvel Comics.</ref> Despite the fact that she was a member of a criminal organization that he desperately wanted to put out of commission, Captain America did not force her to betray her companions. The Society, however, had Diamondback under surveillance<ref>''Captain America'' #372 (1990). Marvel Comics.</ref> and when they realized she had been seeing Captain America socially, certain members demanded that she should be put on trial for treason.<ref>''Captain America'' #380 (1990). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Diamondback was found guilty. Every member voted for her death except for Asp, Black Mamba, Bushmaster and Rock Python. Penalty was death by injection, but King Cobra said he would commute the sentence if she would cooperate with them by revealing the true identity of Captain America. Diamondback refused but Black Mamba secretly alerted Sidewinder, who teleported in to save Diamondback at the last moment.<ref>''Captain America'' #381 (1991). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Diamondback, seeking revenge against the Society, sought out [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]] when Captain America could not guarantee that Black Mamba and Asp be given immunity from arrest. The two infiltrated the Society's headquarters, only to be captured along with Mamba and Asp. Captain America, on the other hand, from his sky cycle, spotted a Serpent Saucer piloted by Cottonmouth and Fer-de-Lance, which was heading back to the Society's hideout. Cap entered the hideout along with the saucer and quickly subdued the two Serpents. He quickly freed Diamondback, Paladin, Mamba and Asp and together they brought down the Society. All members were taken to prison with the exception of Diamondback, Asp, and Mamba (Asp and Mamba eventually were given immunity from arrest due to their help in defeating their former colleagues).<ref>''Captain America'' #382 (1991). Marvel Comics.</ref> Anaconda, Puff Adder and Rock Python escaped capture, as they were not at the headquarters at the time. Boomslang was in the hospital after being shot by thugs around this period. Puff Adder and Rock Python were eventually imprisoned after being thrown out of their Serpent Saucer by [[MODAM]].<ref>''Captain America'' #385-386 (1991). Marvel Comics.</ref> Anaconda, Black Mamba, Asp, and Diamondback were all invited by MODAM to join the [[Femizons]].<ref>''Captain America'' #387-392 (1991). Marvel Comics.</ref> Afterwards, Mamba, Asp, and Diamondback formed a new team called [[BAD Girls, Inc.]] with fellow Femizon [[Impala (Marvel Comics)|Impala]].<ref>''Captain America'' #396 (1992). Marvel Comics.</ref>

After spending time in prison, the Society re-formed again, going back to their old ways. Another encounter with Captain America and the now defunct team called [[Force Works]] seemed to have permanently put them out of commission;<ref>''Captain America'' #434-437 (1994-1995). Marvel Comics.</ref> both Puff Adder and Black Mamba later said that the Society had disbanded.<ref>''Deathlok'' vol. 3 #7 (2000). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Disassembled===
However, the Society re-formed yet again in the ''Captain America/Avengers Disassembled'' tie-ins.<ref>''Captain America'' #30-31 (2004). Marvel Comics.</ref> King Cobra, Rattler, Bushmaster, and a new Death Adder had aided the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] during the ''[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]'' storyline. After that, the four villains have been identified as members of the 142 registered superheroes who appear on the cover of the comic book ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1. Anaconda served with the [[Six Pack (comics)|Six Pack]]<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #7-12 (2004-2005). Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #33-34 (2005). Marvel Comics.</ref> and was later defeated by the [[New Warriors]];<ref>''New Warriors'' vol. 4 #1 (2007). Marvel Comics.</ref> Diamondback, Black Mamba, and Asp had reformed [[BAD Girls, Inc.]];<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #20-23 (2005-2006). Marvel Comics.</ref> Cottonmouth had not been seen since he broke free from prison with [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]], but was later taken back into custody by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #55-63 (2001-2002). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===2008 – present===
During the 2008 "[[Secret Invasion]]" storyline, in which a race of alien shapeshifters known as the [[Skrull]]s were discovered to have engaged in a subversive, long-term invasion of Earth, the Serpent Society took a number of civilians hostage in a compound in the American Midwest, claiming they were protecting themselves from the Skrulls. [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] and his [[Nova Corps]] deputies defeated them in seconds.<ref>''Nova'' vol. 4 #19. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Serpent Society appeared in the 2012 "[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]" storyline, during which they were confronted by the X-Men.<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #0. Marvel Comics.</ref> They were next seen battling [[Taskmaster (character)|Taskmaster]] and [[Deadpool]] after they were contracted by [[Leviathan (Marvel Comics)|Leviathan]] to capture [[Nick Fury Jr.|Marcus Johnson]].<ref>''Battle Scars'' #3-4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Subsequently, Sidewinder returned to lead the Serpent Society, which during one endeavor, attacked the superhero group being protected by [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]]. Having studied the Serpent Society and its members while working for S.H.I.E.L.D., Elektra was able to defeat the Society.<ref>''Elektra'' vol. 3 #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As part of Marvel Comics' 2015 [[All-New, All-Different Marvel]] initiative, Jordan Stryke, also known as the Viper, returned from the dead and became leader of the Serpent Society. He rebranded the group as a criminal business called Serpent Solutions, which later came into conflict with [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]], who had assumed the identity of Captain America, and his allies, which included the now-retired Diamondback.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #4-5. Marvel Comics.</ref> After their plans were foiled, the Serpent Society were arrested by the authorities.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Most of the members of Serpent Solutions escaped from prison and reunited during the 2017 "[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]" storyline, including Slither, who rejoined the group.<ref>Marston, George (March 8, 2017 [http://www.newsarama.com/33488-steve-rogers-post-hydra-wwii-history-revealed-secret-empire-forms-in-captain-america-steve-rogers-13-spoilers.html "A Classic CAP/BUCKY Moment Changed, a SECRET EMPIRE Formed - CAPTAIN AMERICA: STEVE ROGERS #13 SPOILERS"]. [[Newsarama]].</ref><ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Secret Empire'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Serpent Society was next seen working with the brand new Constrictor, the original's son. He had stolen the Book of the Iron Fist and planned to sell it to Iron Fist's enemy Choshin. This led to a battle between the serpents, Choshin's samurais, and Iron Fist and Sabretooth.<ref>''Iron Fist'' #74 (2018). Marvel Comics.</ref> Iron Fist and Coachwhip were the last two fighters standing, and Coachwhip revealed that the Society did not know it was not the real Constrictor and that he had not told them where he hid the book.<ref>''Iron Fist'' #75 (2018). Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]'s bachelor party, [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]] unwittingly hired the Serpent Society as strippers. Anaconda, Asp, Black Mamba, Black Racer, Fer-de-Lance, and Princess Python jumped out of the Thing's cake and battled the Thing and his superhuman guests, including Captain America, [[Iron Man]], [[Thor (comics)|Thor]], [[Black Panther (character)|Black Panther]], [[Doctor Strange]], [[Luke Cage]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Rocket Raccoon]], and [[Thundra]], among others. The ladies of the Serpent Society were eventually defeated and taken into custody.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 5 #5 (2019). Marvel Comics.</ref>

In a prelude to the "[[Hunted (comics)|Hunted]]" storyline, most, if not all, members of the Serpent Society were captured by [[Kraven the Hunter]], Taskmaster, and [[Black Ant]] and forced to participate in a murderous hunt set up by [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]]. While Piet Voorhees' Cobra alias (where he was called King Cobra by Arcade) was selected to be a member of the [[Savage Six]], the rest of the Society members were placed in electric cages to wait for the hunt to commence.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #16 (2019). Marvel Comics.</ref> After the hunt began, the Society attempted to battle the robotic drones being controlled by the wealthy participants, though they realized they were outmatched and fled with the rest of the supervillains.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #19-20 (2019). Marvel Comics.</ref> As they fled, Cottonmouth and Black Mamba commented that they did not believe Viper was suited to be the Serpent Society's leader.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #20.HU (2019). Marvel Comics.</ref> They are saved by [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], who took over as leader of the band of villains. The Society then joined in the fight against the hunters.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #20 (2019). Marvel Comics.</ref> After Kraven the Hunter had Arcade lower the force field, they are seen with [[Armadillo (comics)|Armadillo]] charging towards the awaiting police officers only to be subdued by the Avengers and the Fantastic Four.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #23. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The male members of the Serpent Society attended the Criminal Technology Show Expo, where M.O.D.O.K. had disguised himself as [[Arnim Zola]]. M.O.D.O.K. followed the men into the restroom where he beat them to near death as revenge for his murder many years prior. Iron Man, who had been working with M.O.D.O.K. and disguised as a HYDRA agent, suggested they hide the supervillains before they regained consciousness. However, King Cobra learned of this and alerted the rest of the supervillains in attendance to M.O.D.O.K.'s and Iron Man's scheme, causing a fight to break out.<ref>''M.O.D.O.K.: Head Games'' #2 (2021). Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Devil's Reign]]" storyline, Coachwhip and Puff Adder appear as members of [[Kingpin (character)|Mayor Wilson Fisk]]'s incarnation of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] at the time when Mayor Fisk had outlawed superhero activity. They alongside the Thunderbolts unit with them attack [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] only to be fought off by Spider-Woman as she gets Lindsay McRabe to safety.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' Vol. 7 #18. Marvel Comics.</ref> Boomslang was seen as an inmate of the Myrmidon and was defeated by [[Moon Knight]] in one of the prison bouts.<ref>''Devil's Reign: Moon Knight'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Serpent Society started killing and throwing bodies into an offering pile at their old Serpent Solutions lair in the "name of the serpent". Their worshiping is crashed by Nighthawk. The Avengers also arrive and find that Nighthawk defeated them. The portal that the Serpent Society opened with their worshiping summoned the serpent in question who turns out to be [[Mephisto (Marvel Comics)|Mephisto]]' dog form as it was mentioned by Nighthawk that the serpent was one of his forms. The Serpent Society later escaped from police custody and started killing people while making their way across the Brooklyn Bridge causing the Avengers to take action.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 8 #55.

! width="13%" |Member !!width="20%"| First appearance !!width="67%"| Description
|-
|'''[[Sidewinder (character)|Sidewinder]]''' || ''Marvel Two-in-One'' #64 (June 1980) || '''Seth Voelker''' is a former economics professor and the founder of the Serpent Society who possessed a cloak that allowed him to [[Teleportation|teleport]] himself and a companion. He was the group's leader until the Viper's Serpent Squad infiltrated the Society, after which he retired and left leadership to the Cobra. Years later, he donned the Sidewinder costume once again and took leadership of the Serpent Society as they were hired by the Assassin's Guild to track down the mercenary Elektra.

His snake motif is based on the [[Crotalus cerastes|sidewinder]].
|-
| '''[[Anaconda (character)|Anaconda]]''' || ''Marvel Two-in-One'' #64 (June 1980) || '''Blanche Sitznski''' is a former steelworker from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania who received cybernetic surgery from the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon]] Corporation that gave her [[superhuman]]ly strong [[tentacle]]-like arms and legs that she uses to [[Constriction|constrict]] her foes. They also implanted gills that allowed her to breathe underwater. While not working with the Society, Anaconda has been known to work as a freelance mercenary with several other teams, such as the [[Femizon]]s, [[Six Pack (comics)|Six Pack]], and the Doom Maidens.

Her snake motif is based on the [[anaconda]].
|-
| '''[[Asp (character)|Asp]]''' || ''Captain America'' #310 (Oct. 1985) || '''Cleo Nefertiti''' is a mutant and former [[stripper]] who generates a paralytic energy which is fatal to those who remained in close contact with her for prolonged periods of time. She can channel this energy into electrical blasts, which she called her "venom bursts" or "venom bolts" that can stun or paralyze living beings.

Her snake motif is based on the [[Asp (reptile)|asp]].
|-
| '''[[Black Mamba (character)|Black Mamba]]''' || ''Marvel Two-in-One'' #64 (June 1980) || '''Tanya Sealy''' is a former [[call girl]]. She has a limited form of telepathy that enables her to scan the thoughts of nearby individuals, usually to find an image of someone that the person holds dear. She then manifests the [[Darkforce]] into the image of that cherished person, which in turn, almost hypnotically seduces its target into embracing it. Once physical contact is established, Mamba then lets the Darkforce constrict her victims to death, or at the very least, into unconsciousness. Often the victim is in too deep a state of ecstasy or euphoria to even notice.

Her snake motif is based on the [[black mamba]].
|-
| '''[[Bushmaster (Marvel Comics)|Bushmaster]]''' || ''Captain America'' #310 (Oct. 1985) || '''Quincy McIver''' is a quadriplegic who possesses cybernetic limbs: two arms and a tail in the place of the lower half of his body. He lost his arms and legs in a boating accident while trying to evade the police underwater. Shortly later, the Roxxon Corporation equipped him with bionic arms and a snake-like tail. He took the name "Bushmaster" from his fallen brother (who used the same name when he died in battle against [[Luke Cage]]).

His snake motif is based on the [[Lachesis (genus)|bushmaster]].
|-
| '''[[Cobra (Marvel Comics)|Cobra]]/King Cobra''' || ''Journey into Mystery'' #98 (Nov. 1963) || '''Klaus Voorhees''' is a former lab assistant, longtime [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] foe and partner of [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Mister Hyde]]. He possesses superhuman speed and a great degree of flexibility, can [[Contortion|contort]] his body into almost any shape, and is a skilled [[Wrestling|wrestler]]. He also supplements these abilities with an array of weaponry, mainly his wrist launchers that fire anything from knockout gas to poisoned darts. After Sidewinder retired, the Cobra became '''King Cobra''' and led the group.

Klaus' snake motif was based on the [[cobra]], but later he based his motif on the [[king cobra]].
|-
| '''[[Cottonmouth (Burchell Clemens)|Cottonmouth]]''' || ''Captain America'' #310 (Oct. 1985) || '''Burchell Clemens''' is a supervillain with bionic jaws and steel teeth. He can extend his lower jaw up to a foot from his upper jaw. His jaws possess superhuman strength and extremely sharp fangs.

His motif is based on the [[Agkistrodon piscivorus|cottonmouth or water moccasin]].
|-
| '''[[Death Adder (character)|Death Adder]]''' || ''Marvel Two-in-One'' #64 (June 1980) || '''Roland Burroughs''' is a mute killer. He possessed extended talons which contained deadly venom, he was bioengineered with a poison-spiked bionic tail, and was totally amphibious. Soon after the Serpent Society's first few missions, Death Adder was slain by the Scourge of the Underworld, but was later somehow revived by the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]. He was later killed again by [[Flash Thompson|Agent Venom]] when he was a member of the [[Crime Master]]'s [[Savage Six]].

His motif is based on the [[Agkistrodon contortrix|death adder]].
|-
| '''[[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]]''' || ''Captain America'' #310 (Oct. 1985) || '''Rachel Leighton''' is an acrobat who uses diamond-shaped throwing blades, many of which are equipped with anything from poison, explosives, narcotics, and acid. She defected from the team and eventually became the partner and lover of Captain America. Years later, Diamondback temporarily rejoined the Serpent Society in need of money, though once again turned on her former comrades.

Her motif is based on the [[western diamondback rattlesnake]].
|-
| '''[[Princess Python]]''' || ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #22 (March 1965) || '''Zelda DuBois''' is a professional criminal and [[snake charming|snake charmer]]. She is a member of the [[Circus of Crime]] who has control over a large [[Python (genus)|python]]. When the Serpent Society was hired to kill MODOK, the Princess lost her nerve and abandoned her peers during the assignment to track him down. Eventually, the Society caught up with her, and Sidewinder (who was most disappointed in her performance) had her mind wiped and expelled her from the Society's ranks, despite her explanations. Several years later, she rejoined the Serpent Society under the new leadership and title of Serpent Solutions.
|-
| '''[[Rattler (character)|Rattler]]''' || ''Captain America'' #310 (Oct. 1985) || '''Gustav Krueger''' is a Polish criminal with a bionic tail that can generate vibrations. Perhaps as a result of his powers, he is 85% deaf in both ears and requires hearing aids. He was killed by the new Scourge of the Underworld, though what appears to be a new Rattler has since reappeared with the Serpent Solutions.

His motif is based on the [[rattlesnake]].

|-
|'''[[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]]''' || ''Captain America'' #110 (1969) || '''Ophelia Sarkissian''', otherwise known as '''Madame Hydra''', is the second person to use the codename of Viper. She began using the codename after she killed the original Viper (Jordan Stryke). Some time after Sidewinder had formed the Serpent Society, Viper caught wind of it and used her own criminals (Copperhead, Fer-de-Lance, Puff Adder, and Black Racer) to infiltrate the group. She caused dissension among the Serpents, with several of the original members joining Viper's side. Together, they ousted Sidewinder and those loyal to him. However, Viper's leadership of the Serpent Society was short-lived, as Captain America thwarted her plans. It was the Cobra who eventually defeated Viper, which prompted him to take over the organization. She has since abandoned the idea of leading the group and has not been seen with them since.

Her snake motif is based on the [[Viperidae|viper]].
|-
| '''Black Racer''' || ''Captain America'' #337 (Jan. 1988) || '''Ariana Siddiqi''' can run and move at superhuman speed. She was a member of the fourth Serpent Squad along with Copperhead, Fer-de-Lance, and Puff Adder. She continued on with the Serpent Society, though appearing sparsely throughout the team's later appearances. Like Puff Adder, there are some contradictions with her ethnicity, as she has been seen both as a Caucasian woman and an African-American woman.

Her snake motif is based on the [[Coluber constrictor|black racer]].
|-
| '''Boomslang''' || ''Captain America'' #341 (May 1988) || '''Marc Riemer''' is an Australian criminal who uses snake-shaped [[boomerang]]s, which he called his "serpent-rangs". He is also a skilled unarmed combatant. He joined the Serpent Society during Madame Hydra's takeover. After he was shot by gang members while sent to spy on Diamondback, Boomslang left the Serpent Society for several years. He recently rejoined the group under its new name of Serpent Solutions.

His name is an odd choice, since the [[boomslang]] is not indigenous to [[Australia]] and is actually only found in [[sub-Saharan]] [[Africa]].
|-
| '''Coachwhip''' || ''Captain America'' #341 (May 1988) || '''Beatrix Keener''' is a woman who wields metal-linked [[whip]]s with the ability to generate electricity. She, along with Boomslang and Rock Python, infiltrated the Serpent Society during Madame Hydra's takeover. She stayed with the organization after Madame Hydra's defeat, and began a relationship with King Cobra when he became the new leader. She constantly wore sunglasses, and it was implied that she wears a long, white wig.

Her snake motif is based on the [[Masticophis flagellum|coachwhip]].

| '''[[Copperhead (Marvel Comics)|Copperhead]]''' || ''Captain America'' #337 (Jan. 1988) || '''Davis Lawfers''' is the leader of the so-called fourth Serpent Squad (consisting also of Fer-de-Lance, Black Racer, and Puff Adder), and one of Madame Hydra's most loyal minions. When the Cobra became the new leader of the Society, Copperhead left the group for many years. He has since returned with the Serpent Society under new leadership. Copperhead has no superhuman powers but is equipped with a pair of gauntlets which fire power blasts and poisoned darts. For protection he wears a suit of copper-colored scale mail.

His motif is based on the [[Agkistrodon contortrix|copperhead]].
|-
| '''Fer-de-Lance''' || ''Captain America'' #337 (Jan. 1988) || '''Teresa Vasquez''' is a professional assassin hailing from Puerto Rico. Fer-de-lance has a pair of retractable "fangs" similar to that of Bushmaster's. Along with Copperhead, Black Racer, and Puff Adder, Fer-de-Lance worked for Madame Hydra as part of the fourth Serpent Squad. When Sidewinder invited the quartet to join the Serpent Society, Madame Hydra began her takeover, but it failed. Despite this, Fer-de-Lance continued working for the Serpent Society.

Her motif is based on the [[Bothrops lanceolatus|fer-de-lance]].
|-
| '''[[Puff Adder (comics)|Puff Adder]]''' || ''Captain America'' #337 (Jan. 1988) || '''Gordon "Gordo" Fraley''' is a mutant with the power to breathe various debilitative gases (in one instance the gas was able to eat away a metal lock) and inflate his body mass to a certain extent. He also has superhuman strength and increased physical durability. There seems to be a confusion of what race he is, he has been depicted as Caucasian as often as he has been depicted as Black. Puff Adder was hired by Madame Hydra to work as part of the fourth Serpent Squad in order to catch the attention of the Serpent Society and eventually being infiltrate the group. He has since been a prominent member of the Society. Although he was believed to have been de-powered on [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], he has since appeared with his powers intact.

His motif is based on the [[Bitis arietans|puff adder]].
|-
| '''[[Rock Python]]''' || ''Captain America'' #341 (May 1988) || '''M'Gula''' is a metallurgist from South Africa that served the terrorist known as the Viper. His body is as hard as his namesake and he throws "snake eggs" that burst upon impact, sending out entangling strands of metallic tendrils. He also seems to have a small measure of superhuman strength: he once hung Captain America over the edge of a building by his ankle with only one hand; his body has the density of rock. At one point, Rock Python attempted to retire from villainy and work as a security guard, but he has since returned to the Serpent Society when they were taken over by Jordan Stryke and renamed Serpent Solutions.

His snake motif is based on the [[African rock python]].
|-
| '''[[Slither (comics)|Slither]]''' || ''Captain America'' Annual #4 (1977) || '''Aaron Salomon''' is a mutant who had previously been a member of [[Resistants|Mutant Force]]. He has the head of a snake while the rest of his body is humanoid. He briefly worked alongside the Serpent Society when Madame Hydra infiltrated the group. After his defeat, he left the Society to rejoin Mutant Force, but has recently rejoined the group.

'''Jubilation''' "'''Jubilee'''" '''Lee''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], most commonly in association with the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Marc Silvestri]], the character first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #244 (May 1989).<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=201}}</ref>

Jubilee is a member of the human subspecies known as [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]], born with superhuman abilities. She can generate pyrotechnic energy blasts from her hands. Introduced as an orphaned "mall rat" from Beverly Hills, Jubilee joined the X-Men in the early 1990s, becoming the team's youngest member and often playing a [[sidekick]] role to her father-figure, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].

Jubilee eventually joined the junior team [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]], and was a prominent character in the 1990s [[X-Men: The Animated Series|''X-Men'' animated series]]. In late 2004, Marvel launched a self-titled six-part limited series for Jubilee set in Los Angeles, written by [[Robert Kirkman]]. In early 2011, she appeared in the four-part limited series ''Wolverine and Jubilee'', written by [[Kathryn Immonen]].

Jubilee was one of many mutants who lost their powers in the 2005 storyline "[[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]"; she later reappeared using technology-based powers, using the alias '''Wondra''', in the ''[[New Warriors]]'' comic book series. During the 2010 "[[Curse of the Mutants]]" storyline, she was turned into a [[vampire]]. She became a [[single mother]] after adopting a son, Shogo, in a 2013 storyline. She was eventually, in 2019, cured of her vampirism and had her mutant powers restored by a shard of the Phoenix Force.

Jubilee has cameo appearances in the first three [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' films]], portrayed by Katrina Florece in the first film, and by Kea Wong in its two sequels. In the 2016 film ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'', she was portrayed by [[Lana Condor]].

==Publication history==
Jubilee was created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Marc Silvestri]] and first appeared in ''[[The Uncanny X-Men]]'' #244 (May 1989). Claremont had earlier introduced a "Jubilee" of sorts in ''The New Mutants'' Annual #2 (1986). In that story, Darla of the Fat Boys, after being mentally and biologically warped, uses identical powers to those of the later Jubilation Lee and introduces herself as "Jubilee! Whose every move is a celebration!" In her first appearance Jubilation Lee gives a similar self-introduction: "Actually, my name is Jubilee! 'Cause with me, every day's a celebration!" Darla is returned to normal by the end of ''The New Mutants'' Annual #2, and no in-story connection between the characters is ever established.

Jubilee appeared regularly as an [[X-Men]] team member in ''The Uncanny X-Men'' through issue #280 (Sept. 1991), and later was a staple of ''X-Men'' (1991) as a member of the X-Men's Blue Team.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=241}}</ref> During the same timeframe, she also served as [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]'s sidekick in ''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #40–75 (1991–1993).

After the [[Phalanx Covenant]] storyline in ''X-Men'' #16–17 and ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #316–317, Jubilee, who was then a teenager, was transferred to the X-Men trainee squad [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]] and starred in the entire run of ''Generation X'' #1–75 (1994–2001). After the dissolution of Generation X, Jubilee returned to the pages of ''The Uncanny X-Men'', first as a member of the X-Corporation (#403–406, 2002), and later as a team member in her own right (#423–437, 2003–2004). Jubilee had a six-issue self-titled limited series in 2004 written by [[Robert Kirkman]], but loses her mutant powers in ''House of M – The Day After'' #1 (Jan. 2006). She then adopts the alias Wondra and joins the reconstituted [[New Warriors]] in ''New Warriors'' vol. 4 #1–20 (2007–2009).

Jubilee is affected with vampirism during the "[[Curse of the Mutants]]" in ''X-Men'' vol. 3 #1 (July 2010) and remained a sporadic character on that title through issue #27 (April 2012), as well as a supporting character in ''X-23'' vol. 3 (2010–2011). In 2011, she saw print in her second four issue limited series, ''Wolverine and Jubilee'' written by [[Kathryn Immonen]] and drawn by [[Phil Noto]], as an aftermath follow-up to the ''Curse of the Mutants'' storyline. Jubilee later featured as a regular character in the all-female ''X-Men'' vol. 4 #1–25 (2013–2015), and as a supporting character in ''[[Patsy Walker|Patsy Walker, a.k.a. Hellcat!]]'' (2016). She returned as a main cast member in ''Generation X'' vol. 2 #1-9, #85-87 (2017-2018) as the adult mentor to the new teenage main characters, during which she was cured of vampirism and had her mutant powers restored.

==Fictional character biography==

===Origins===
The daughter of two prosperous Chinese immigrants, Jubilation "Jubilee" Lee was born in [[Beverly Hills, California]], where she lived with her wealthy parents. An immensely talented [[gymnastics|gymnast]], she was believed to have the potential to participate in the [[Olympic Games]]. This life was destroyed when her parents were murdered by the [[contract killing|hitmen]] Reno and Molokai.

Jubilee was sent to an [[orphanage]] but ran away and hid in the Hollywood Mall, stealing food to survive. She discovered her mutant power to generate blinding and explosive energy blasts (herself referring to them as "fireworks") while running away from mall security. The stress of fleeing security guards caused Jubilee to emit a large light energy blast in a back alley. This disoriented the men and allowed her to escape. Learning about her mutant ability, she realized she could earn money by using it to entertain customers in the mall.

The mall security attempted to put an end to her unauthorized performances, but she continued to elude them. They hired the M-Squad, a company of professional mutant hunters, to capture her. Jubilee was rescued by [[X-Men]] members [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]], [[Betsy Braddock|Psylocke]], [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]]. Curious about the women, she tracked them to the portal leading back to their base in the [[Outback]] and stepped through.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #244 (May 1989)</ref>

Jubilee stays hidden in the base, never having heard of the X-Men and has no idea how they might react to her presence.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #247 (Aug. 1989)</ref> She steals food and borrows clothes from several of the X-Men to create a makeshift costume for herself. She is attacked by a cybernetic dog, and forced to use her powers in self-defense by blowing up the beast. This is the first time Jubilee learns her powers can do real damage, although a later [[retroactive continuity|retcon]] has her first manifestation causing destruction on a similar scale.{{issue|date=July 2014}}

While sneaking around the caverns in the Outback base, Jubilee witnesses the X-Man [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] being captured and tortured by the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]]. Jubilee is terrified of the Reavers, but unable to convince herself to abandon a fellow human being to such suffering. During a respite from the torture sessions, Jubilee helps Wolverine back to her hiding spot in the complex, where she nurses him back to health. Before entirely recovered, Wolverine and Jubilee are forced to abandon their sanctuary when the Reavers hunt them down.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #251–252 (November 1989)</ref> The pair make their way to [[Madripoor]] where they battle the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] and [[Matsu'o Tsurayaba]]'s [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]]. Jubilee holds her own against the highly skilled Hand, and blows up part of the Mandarin's castle with her powers when she, along with Wolverine and Psylocke, is taken prisoner.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #257–268 (January–September 1990)</ref>

Afterward, Jubilee teams up with Wolverine on several of his missions throughout the world. She does not handle traveling well, as she desires American food and luxuries. She helps Wolverine in battle when he becomes involved with well-intentioned but violent mercenaries.

Alongside Wolverine and Psylocke, Jubilee battles [[Harriers (comics)|Hardcase and the Harriers]].<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #261 (May 1990)</ref> She also meets the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]]<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #268 (September 1990)</ref> and participates in a mission to rescue several kidnapped [[New Mutants]] from [[Genosha]]. Against her protests, Wolverine places her in charge of looking after [[Tabitha Smith|Boom Boom]] and [[Rictor]] and meeting up with [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]].<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #271 (Dec. 1990)</ref> The three survive on the streets of the island nation before meeting up with the other X-Men.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #96–97, ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #272 (Jan. 1991)</ref> After meeting the X-Men, she travels with them to the [[Shi'ar]] Empire, but is captured by the [[Skrull|Warskrulls]].<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #274–277 (March–June 1991)</ref> She briefly falls under the control of the [[Shadow King]], along with the X-Men and numerous others.<ref>''X-Factor'' #69 (Aug. 1991)</ref><ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #280 (Sept. 1991)</ref>

===Wolverine and the X-Men===
Wolverine brings Jubilee to [[Professor X]]avier at the [[X-Mansion]], who welcomes the girl with open arms. She and Wolverine develop a close father-daughter relationship with one another. Due to this relationship, Jubilee is referred to as Wolverine's unofficial sidekick.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/x-men-best-jubilee-facts-trivia/?view=all|title=X-Men: 12 Things You Need to Know About Jubilee|website=Screen Rant|last=Walsh|first=Megan|date=March 26, 2016}}</ref>

Jubilee finds a home with the X-Men and joins the X-Men Blue Team.<ref>''X-Men'' #4–5 (Jan.–Feb. 1992)</ref> She aids her fellow mutants in battles against [[Omega Red]], the Shi'ar Empire, Skrulls, and the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]], among others. With the last three, she holds her own against many powerful entities, often being the vital factor in saving fellow X-Men and/or innocent civilians. She forms close bonds with many of the team members, taking piggyback rides with [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] as she enjoys his leaping abilities. When Professor Xavier temporarily regains the use of his legs, she takes him rollerblading.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #297 (Feb. 1993)</ref> She has the chance to talk about Wolverine with [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]], who had been in her sidekick role before, and bonds with the younger [[Magik (Illyana Rasputina)|Illyana Rasputin]]. Jubilee later mourns the loss of Illyana with the rest of the X-Men, especially [[Jean Grey]].<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #303 (Aug. 1993)</ref>

Alongside the X-Men, Jubilee is captured by Omega Red, Matsu'o Tsuryaba, and [[Fenris (comics)|Fenris]]. She also fights [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] during this encounter.<ref>''X-Men'' #5–7 (Feb.–April 1992)</ref> Alongside Wolverine, she then clashes with [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]] (see [[#Abcissa|Abcissa]]), and is arrested in Tokyo for speeding and driving without a license.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #52–53 (March–April 1992)</ref> There she meets [[Yukio (comics)|Yukio]], and teams with her against [[Cylla Markham]].<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #55–57 (June–July 1992)</ref> She aids the X-Men and [[Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)|Ghost Rider]] against the Brood.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #8–9 (May–June 1992)</ref> Jubilee then journeys with the X-Men to Mojoworld.<ref>''X-Men'' #10–11 (July–Aug. 1992)</ref>

During one adventure, Jubilee falls halfway through a time portal and witnesses the moment when hitmen arrived at her home to kill her parents. Knowing the names and faces of her parents' murderers for the first time, Jubilee sets out to kill them, but Wolverine talks her out of it.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #72–74 (Aug.–Oct. 1993)</ref> Shortly after, Wolverine leaves the X-Men. He does not give Jubilee the option to come with him, instead leaving her a note which repeatedly emphasizes that she should stick with Professor Xavier and not go out on her own again.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #75 (Nov. 1993)</ref> Though she maintains her usual spunky demeanor in the ensuing weeks, the other X-Men notice that she feels somewhat abandoned by Wolverine's leaving.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #29 (Feb. 1994)</ref>

===Generation X===
Jubilee leaves the X-Men to join a new group of teenage mutants known as [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]].<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #318 (Nov. 1994)</ref> The team is led by [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] and [[Emma Frost]], and is initially composed of Jubilee, [[Husk (comics)|Husk]], [[Synch (comics)|Synch]], [[M (Marvel Comics)|M]], and [[Skin (Marvel Comics)|Skin]], with [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]],<ref>''Generation X'' #1 (Nov. 1994)</ref> [[Penance (X-Men)|Penance]],<ref>''Generation X'' #3 (Jan. 1995)</ref> [[Mondo (comics)|Mondo]],<ref>''Generation X'' Annual '95</ref> and [[Gaia (Marvel Comics)|Gaia]]<ref>''Generation X'' #45 (Dec. 1998)</ref> joining as the series progresses. The team also becomes a safe haven for three young wards during their adventures: [[Artie Maddicks]], [[Leech (comics)|Leech]],<ref>''Generation X'' #6 (Aug. 1995)</ref> and temporarily, [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]].<ref>''Generation X'' #20 (Oct. 1996)</ref>

Both Banshee and Emma Frost educate the teenagers in school subjects as well as combat and field skills (with occasional assistance from visiting instructors such as Wolverine<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #94 (Oct. 1995)</ref> and Beast).<ref>''Generation X'' #21 (Nov. 1996)</ref> Jubilee and the other mutant teens hone their unique abilities and occasionally battle foes such as the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], Omega Red,<ref>''Generation X'' #10–11 (Dec. 1995–Jan. 1996)</ref> and their archrival [[Emplate]]. Time after time, Jubilee uses her experience with the X-Men to help her teammates outsmart their enemies. On more than one occasion, Jubilee is solely responsible for the defeat of Emplate. She uses sarcasm when Emplate siphons her powers so that he will become enraged enough to not have control over them, causing him to blast himself with Jubilee's energy blasts.<ref>''Generation X'' #13–14 (March–April 1996)</ref> During the team's last encounter with Emplate, Jubilee uses her power to blow up Proudstar Hall in order to defeat him. Her teammates survive the massive explosion because [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] covers them with an ice shield.<ref>''Generation X'' #57 (Nov. 1999)</ref>

During her stay at the [[Massachusetts Academy (comics)|Massachusetts Academy]], Jubilee is kidnapped and held hostage by [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]] during [[Operation: Zero Tolerance]].<ref>''Generation X'' #25 (March 1997)</ref> She manages to resist his mental probes for a good amount of time, hiding valuable information about the X-Men.<ref>''Generation X'' #27–28 (May–June 1997)</ref> Jubilee stages an escape early on, knocking several armed soldiers unconscious with a large plasma volley. However, she is recaptured when she stops to give CPR to one of the guards she injured.<ref>''Generation X'' #26 (April 1997)</ref> She eventually escapes with the help of Bastion's assistant, Daria.<ref>''Generation X'' #29–31 (Aug.–Oct. 1997)</ref> While wandering the desert after her getaway, she is attacked by a [[Prime Sentinel]] and holds her own by blasting his vision receptors. She is saved at the last minute by Wolverine, who reunites her with the X-Men. After discovering Bastion has planted a nano-explosive inside [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], the X-Men return home, dropping Jubilee off at Massachusetts Academy on the way.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #117–118 (Oct.–Nov. 1997)</ref>

One of the most important episodes of her stay with Generation X comes when she discovers the true killer of her parents, Hunter Brawn. She stages an operation, using her mutant powers, and innate skills and abilities to track down Brawn. With the help of her friends and teammates, she manages to defeat him. Enraged at how he destroyed her family, Jubilee's powers flare to a massive level, but instead of killing the man, she takes out her aggression by blowing up his warehouse, leaving him to be arrested by local authorities.<ref>''Generation X'' Annual '99</ref>

===After Generation X===
After Generation X disbands, Jubilee moves to Los Angeles with her former teammate Skin to pursue an acting career.<ref>''Generation X'' #75 (June 2001)</ref> She is cast in nothing but stereotypical Asian roles, and after her agent tries to seduce her, she hits him with a powerful energy blast.<ref>''X-Men Unlimited'' #34 (June 2002)</ref>

Around the same time, Jubilee is offered a position on Banshee's militaristic [[X-Corps]] team, alongside former teammates Husk and M. The three young women hesitantly join Banshee in order to keep an eye on him. During her run with the X-Corps, Jubilee holds off an uprising in Paris by blinding hostile enemies. Jubilee and Husk, with the help of [[Stacy X]], also manage to take down the [[Blob (comics)|Blob]] and rescue Banshee from [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]].<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #403–406 (April–July 2002)</ref>

[[File:Jubileewondra.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Jubilee as Wondra. Art by Humberto Ramos.]]
After her time in the X-Corps, Jubilee returns to Los Angeles with Skin, but the two (along with [[Magma (comics)|Magma]] and other mutants) are kidnapped and crucified on the front lawn of the X-Mansion by the [[Church of Humanity (comics)|Church of Humanity]]. Jubilee, Magma, and the others recover from the attack thanks to [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]]'s healing blood, but Skin is not so fortunate.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #423 (July 2003)</ref> Jubilee becomes depressed due to the loss of her friend, and reunites with Husk. The two, along with Angel, attend Skin's funeral. Since the gravekeeper would not allow a mutant to be buried in his cemetery, he has Skin cremated and hands Jubilee the ashes. Afterward, Jubilee goes on a few missions with [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Havok (comics)|Havok]]'s Uncanny X-Men team,<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #429 (Oct. 2003)</ref> but is taken off the active roster when Cyclops decides she needs a mental break.<ref>''X-Men'' #157 (July 2004)</ref>

While inactive, Jubilee is contacted by a long lost relative, her aunt Hope. Hope decides to adopt Jubilee and take her into her home in Los Angeles, which gives Jubilee a much-needed break from X-Mansion life.<ref>''Jubilee'' #1 (Nov. 2004–April 2005)</ref> Jubilee attends Payton Noble High School and becomes a peer advisor. She gets into a few fights at school, and is reprimanded because of her power display. She also befriends a mutant named Shane Shooter, and helps him take down a gang leader. Unfortunately for Jubilee, her aunt is caught in a crime ring, as she was an assassin. While Wolverine is visiting Jubilee, the two of them – along with Hope (and her butler Brad) – get into a battle with Hope's former boss. Hope is caught in a violent explosion and seemingly dies (she is later revealed to have been thrown afar by the explosion, revealing her cybernetic nature), causing a distraught Jubilee to move back to the X-Mansion with Wolverine,<ref>''Jubilee'' #2–6 (Nov. 2004–April 2005)</ref> where she is seen celebrating Christmas.<ref>''X-Men'' #165</ref>

===Decimation and aftermath===
Jubilee is revealed to have lost her powers on [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]],<ref>''Decimation: House of M – The Day After'' (Jan. 2006)</ref> due to the reality-altering powers of the [[Scarlet Witch]]. She returns to New York shortly after running a half-way house for depowered mutants in [[Queens]], New York,<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #6 (Nov. 2006)</ref> and is kidnapped by Omega Red and his henchmen while Wolverine is sidetracked during the battle. She is taken to Berlin as a hostage. Wolverine manages to use [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] to find Jubilee, but she is beaten and badly injured. Logan trades his freedom from S.H.I.E.L.D. for Jubilee's safety and well-being. She is carried away in a medical unit by S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #10 (March 2007)</ref>

Jubilee next resurfaces as Wondra,<ref>''New Warriors'' vol. 4 #1 (Aug. 2007)</ref> the second-in-command of one of the incarnations of the [[New Warriors]]. She uses technologically based super-strength (supplied by what appears to be a variation of [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|The Wizard]]'s "Wonder Gauntlets") capable of lifting a locomotive engine over her head.<ref>''New Warriors'' vol. 4 #2 (Sept. 2007)</ref> Recruited as the first member, Jubilee takes a more serious attitude to her role as Wondra and serves alongside fellow X-Men and former teammates [[Chamber (comics)|Decibel]] and Stacy X. Jubilee distrusts [[Night Thrasher]] and uncovers evidence that he is using the team for less than noble reasons, and after a trip to the future, the former mutants leave the team in the hands of ex-members of [[Avengers: The Initiative|the Initiative]] ([[Slapstick (comics)|Slapstick]], [[Vance Astrovik|Justice]], [[Ultra Girl]], et al.).<ref>''New Warriors'' vol. 4 #20 (March 2009)</ref>

After leaving the New Warriors, she returns to San Francisco and meets with a group of young mutants her age, who tell her about [[Asteroid M#Fifth version/Utopia|Utopia]], the island home for mutants. Jubilee reaffirms her identity as a mutant, despite being depowered, but still declines to join the X-Men on Utopia.<ref>''X-Men: Nation X'' #2 (Jan. 2010)</ref>

===Curse of the Mutants===
Cyclops sends [[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]] to check on Jubilee, and while the girls are chatting, Jubilee is one of many individuals to be mass-infected with a bio-engineered virus by a vampire suicide bomber. Jubilee is taken to the X-Men's headquarters, where they run tests on her, confirming that the virus is slowly but surely transforming her into a vampire, making her less and less able to handle sunlight. Meanwhile, others infected by the virus quickly turn into full vampires and begin enacting the plans of the mysterious "Lord of Vampires".<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 3 #1 (Sept. 2010)</ref>

Later, while talking to [[Doctor Nemesis]] (James Bradley), Jubilee reveals that something is calling for her, to which Doctor Nemesis tells her to fight it back. Jubilee eventually tells him that she does not want to fight. Much later, while the X-Men gather to discuss the death of Dracula and learn who the new Lord of Vampires is, [[Kavita Rao|Dr. Kavita Rao]] is seen checking on her, only to be attacked.<ref>''Wolverine & Jubilee'' #1 (March 2011)</ref> Wolverine then feeds her some of his blood, since his healing factor keeps her from becoming savage.<ref>''Wolverine & Jubilee'' #2 (March 2011)</ref> It is also revealed that Rockslide has a crush on Jubilee and follows her and Wolverine to Siberia to save her from a vampire cult.<ref>''Wolverine & Jubilee'' #4 (March 2011)</ref>

Jubilee leaves Utopia to go see [[Curse of the Mutants|Xarus]], who bites her. It is also revealed that Xarus only wants Jubilee so the X-Men can come to rescue her and fall into a trap, especially Wolverine.<ref>''X-Men'' #2 (Oct. 2010)</ref> Jubilee is successfully transformed into a vampire and temporarily does the same to Wolverine after he comes to rescue her.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 3 #3</ref> She remains a vampire and is detained in a holding cell beneath Utopia for observation, with Cyclops and Wolverine both rejecting [[Blade (comics)|Blade]]'s suggestion that killing her is the only solution.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 3 #6 (Feb. 2011)</ref>

===Touching Darkness===
At [[Gambit (Marvel Comics)|Gambit]]'s behest, Wolverine travels to Paris, taking Jubilee with him. The tensions between Jubilee and [[X-23]] (who is traveling with Gambit) flare up. Meanwhile, Gambit talks to Wolverine about the difference between how he treats Jubilee and X-23, both of whom see him as a father-figure.<ref>''X-23'' vol. 3 #10 (July 2011)</ref> Jubilee soon starts to develop a friendship with X-23 due to their similar circumstances, with the latter helping her deal with her urges to kill, while Jubilee in turn helps Laura learn how to be a "normal" girl.<ref>''X-23'' vol. 3 #11 (Aug. 2011)</ref> She is later taken in by a group of vampires called the Forgiven, who have learned to move beyond their need for blood and can move about in the day, as a student.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 3 #27 (June 2012)</ref>

===Marvel NOW!===
Jubilee returns to the X-Men with an orphaned baby, whom she names Shogo, who was infected with Arkea.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 4 #1 (July 2013)</ref> During the ''[[Battle of the Atom]]'' event, [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel X]] (a member of the future X-Men) is revealed to be a fully grown Shogo. The two spend some quality time together after the death of the future Jubilee and the defeat of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]].<ref>''Battle of the Atom'' (Sept.–Oct. 2013)</ref> Afterward, Storm informs her that the adoption papers have gone through, legally making Jubilee the mother of Shogo.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 4 #7 (Jan. 2014)</ref>

===Reverting to a mutant===
Jubilee becomes a teacher at the newly-renamed Xavier Institute,<ref>''Generation X'' vol. 2 #1</ref> mentoring students deemed unsuited to become either X-Men or mutant ambassadors to humanity.<ref>''Generation X'' vol. 2 #2</ref> Students under her supervision include [[Quentin Quire]], Bling!, Nature Girl, Eye-Boy, Benjamin Deeds and Nathaniel Carver.{{issue|date=January 2020}}

After [[M (Marvel Comics)|Monet]] falls under the influence of her brother, [[Emplate]], and attacks the school, she fights Jubilee and takes away the medallion she uses as protection from sunlight. Monet then threw her out of the school and as the sunlight began burning Jubilee, Quentin Quire sacrifices the shard of the Phoenix Force he carried within him to save her from certain death, curing Jubilee of her vampirism and restoring her mutant powers in the process.<ref>''Generation X'' vol. 2 #86</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Jubilee has had a diverse range of powers as a mutant, a depowered human, and later as a vampire.

===Mutant powers===
As a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], Jubilee has the power to generate pyrotechnic energy plasmoids from her hands. She has referred to these blasts as "fireworks". The plasmoids obeyed her mental control, traveling where she directed them, arranging themselves in various shapes, and exploding when she wished. The strength of the blasts varied in degrees of power and intensity, and can range from a multitude of colorful sparkles capable of temporarily blinding a person, to a powerful detonation capable of smashing objects and destroying property, or a precision burst inside a human brain, simulating the effects of a massive stroke. Jubilee can also absorb the energy back into her own body without harm.

While training in Generation X, Emma Frost described Jubilee as having the untapped ability to detonate matter at a subatomic level, which in theory is the equivalent of a [[Nuclear weapon design#Fusion|nuclear fusion bomb]].<ref>''X-Men'' #36 (Sept. 1994)</ref> Her moral stance on taking a life was observed by Emma during the [[Phalanx Covenant]], when Jubilee explained her fear of killing someone should her powers ever flare up again, as they did during the [[Acts of Vengeance]] storyline in ''The [[Uncanny X-Men]]'' (she destroyed the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]]'s mansion in a massive explosion, out of grief after believing that Wolverine had been killed).<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #258 (Feb. 1990)</ref> Emma stated that Jubilee had unlimited potential and was one of the most powerful mutants she had ever encountered. Jubilee's ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' alternate had few qualms about using her powers, and made liberal use of her full ability.

In her early appearances, Jubilee also displayed an apparent immunity to [[telepathy]], but this was soon abandoned by writers. She had, on occasion, used this ability to hide herself from telepathic scans and to block mental probes from [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]].<ref>''Generation X'' #27–28 (May–June 1997)</ref>

In the aftermath of [[House of M]], Jubilee was one of the many mutants to be depowered, but she has since regained her powers.

===As Wondra===
Jubilee was among the mutants depowered by M-Day. She fell into a deep depression following the loss of her powers, going through several jobs before joining the New Warriors. During this time, she was known by the alias "Wondra".

Upon joining the post-''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' New Warriors team, Wondra gained highly advanced technology from [[Night Thrasher (Dwayne Taylor)|Night Thrasher]] to replace her mutant abilities, giving her superhuman strength. While the upper limits of this power were not explored, the technology allowed Wondra to lift the engine of a freight train over her head. Wondra's power suit and gauntlets also enhanced her with limited invulnerability, as well as the ability to fly with hover discs.<ref>''New Warriors'' vol. 4 #1 (Aug. 2007)</ref>

===Vampire abilities===
Jubilee gained the powers of a vampire from her transformation by the bite of Xarus, the son of [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]]. They include superhuman strength and speed, and turning into vapor. It is possible that she can heal much faster than a human. As a vampire, Jubilee now possesses all of the weaknesses of a vampire. She uses a medallion created by Xarus which allows all vampires to endure the sunlight. Quentin Quire later apparently cured Jubilee from her vampiric status after using a shard of the Phoenix Force he carried to save her from certain death, restoring her mutant powers in the process.<ref>''Generation X'' vol. 2 #86</ref>

===Innate traits and abilities===
Jubilee is a talented gymnast and in-line skater. While living on her own, she used her skills to evade capture while stealing to survive, first from the various shops in the mall and later at the X-Men's Australian base. She has also displayed above average [[hand-to-hand combat]] skills, having learned street-fighting techniques while in Los Angeles County Juvenile Hall, and being coached further by Wolverine. Her skills are sufficient to survive combat with the Hand. She also demonstrated strong leadership abilities, often being placed in a field commander role by Banshee during her closing time with Generation X, and acting as a drill-sergeant figure for the most recent New Warriors team.

In an issue of the ''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]'' comic series, it was stated that Jubilee suffers from [[dyscalculia]].<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #62 (Oct. 1992)</ref>

==Other versions==

===Abcissa===
In one [[alternate history|alternate timeline]], Mojo tried to stop the [[Big Crunch]], the end of time and collapse of all matter which would start a new [[Big Bang]]. Jubilee told him to stop, and she would be his slave. Giving her the new name "Abcissa", her powers would be altered to animate and control the many chains that were attached to her body. Abcissa and Mojo kidnapped Jubilee, taking her to the Crunch, so she would become Mojo's slave. Jubilee refused, which nullified Abcissa's existence. Wolverine arrived and defeated Mojo.{{issue|date=April 2013}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/abscissa.htm|title=Abcissa (Mojo servant, alternate Jubilee)|website=Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe|access-date=June 5, 2016}}</ref>

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'', Jubilee is part of Gambit's [[Age of Apocalypse#Gambit and the X-Ternals|X-Ternals]], a group of rebel thieves. She went with the X-Ternals to the Shi'ar Empire in order to steal a piece of the [[M'Kraan Crystal]]. Jubilee displayed a greater level of control over her power than her Marvel-616 version by detonating the clothing of several Madri enforcers on a molecular level. In addition, she uses the full extent of her powers by destroying a Shi'ar ship single-handedly.<ref>''Gambit and the X-Ternals'' #1 (March 1995)</ref> Her fate in the tenth anniversary issue of the ''Age of Apocalypse'' is not revealed.

===Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows===
In this continuity, Jubilee is an instructor at Xavier's School for Gifted Children, but is revealed to be a double agent working for Magneto.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows'' vol. 2 #6</ref>

===Amalgam Comics===
In this [[Amalgam Comics|alternate universe]], where part of the Marvel multiverse is fused with part of the DC multiverse, Jubilee is combined with Robin to become Sparrow, the sidekick of [[Dark Claw]] (Wolverine + [[Batman]]).<ref>''Legends of the Dark Claw'' #1 (April 1996)</ref>

===Days of Future Past===
In [[Days of Future Past]], Jubilee is one of the last X-Men alive and among the few mutants who are not prisoners in a concentration camp. She lives with her lover [[Synch (comics)|Synch]] in the ruins of Hollywood.<ref>''X-Men: Days of Future Past: Wolverine''</ref>

===DC vs. Marvel===
In the 1996 Marvel/DC crossover series ''[[DC vs. Marvel]]'' storyline, Jubilee first meets [[Tim Drake|Robin]] when he suddenly appears in her room. She starts admiring his costume and eventually develops an attraction to him. The two are later transported to a warehouse and before they begin their fight, Jubilee kisses Robin. While Jubilee has the upper hand, Robin uses a sneak attack and wins without hitting her. Robin and Jubilee suddenly end up in [[Venice]], and while they do not know how, neither cares, and soon they start a relationship.<ref>''DC vs. Marvel'' #1–3 (April–May 1996)</ref> With the universe restored and the heroes and villains returned to their respective universe, Jubilee becomes upset that she will never see Robin again. However, she is later briefly reunited with him in the follow-up ''Age of Amalgam'' Marvel/DC crossover series.

===MC2===
In [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]], Jubilee is the leader of a team of mutant heroes called the [[X-People]].<ref>''J2'' #1 (Oct. 1998)</ref> She was also part of [[A-Next]], a future generation of Avengers.<ref>''A-Next'' #1 (Oct. 1998)</ref> However, Jubilee preferred to act on her own and only reluctantly cooperates with other heroes. She apparently still retains a reserve status with the Avengers, and has joined them on several occasions. She can sporadically be seen in the [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]] series and related miniseries.{{issue|date=April 2013}}

===Mutant X===
In ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'', Jubilee is the leader of the villain team the Marauders, consisting of [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]], [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]], [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], and Husk, although she has trouble keeping her team under control. After the Marauders fought with [[Alternative versions of Storm#Mutant X|Bloodstorm]], Jubilee was severely hurt.<ref>''Mutant X'' #26–27 (Dec. 2000–Jan. 2001)</ref>

===Team X===
Team X was a brief one-shot featuring [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] and [[Deathbird]]. It featured Jubilee in a green bodysuit (codenamed Vertigo) from roughly fifteen years into the future. Vertigo was a part of a resistance movement against Shi'ar Majestrix Alanna, the maniacal daughter of [[Lilandra Neramani]] and Professor Xavier. This version of Jubilee possesses several light-based powers including making light knives, firing photon beams, and turning invisible.{{issue|date=April 2013}}

===Ultimate Marvel===
[[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] Jubilee is a member of [[Alpha Flight#Ultimate Marvel|Alpha Flight]], first appearing in ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' #94. The team overpowers the X-Men during their game of baseball against the [[New Mutants#Other versions|Academy of Tomorrow]] and kidnaps [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]], claiming that he belongs with them. Her powers and appearance seem not to differ greatly from her Earth-616 counterpart, as well as her laid back personality during and after the battle. She is a fan of [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]]. She is such a fan that she planned to get Dazzler's autograph and wore one of her band's shirts when they attacked, much to the annoyance of her team, especially [[Snowbird (comics)#Ultimate Snowbird|Snowbird]].<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #94–95 (July–Aug. 2008)</ref>

===Secret Wars===
During the [[Secret Wars]] storyline, Jubilee appeared as a member of the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]], and is a high school student at the Victor von Doom Institute for Gifted Youths in the [[Battleworld]] domain of Doomstadt. She is the leader of a gang-type group called The Night Witches along with [[Delphyne Gorgon]] and Pixie. It is unknown whether she is a vampire or not in this reality.<ref>''Runaways'' vol. 4 #1–4 (Aug.–Nov. 2015)</ref>

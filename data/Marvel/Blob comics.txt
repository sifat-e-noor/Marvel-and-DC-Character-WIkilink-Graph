The '''Blob''' ('''Frederick J. "Fred" Dukes''') is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is usually depicted as an adversary of the [[X-Men]]. A [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] originally depicted as a fat circus freak, the Blob claims to be immovable when he so desires.<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |pages=33–34}}</ref> He possesses an extreme amount of pliable body mass, which grants him superhuman strength. Possessing the demeanor of a bully, he mostly uses his powers for petty crime and as a member of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] and [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]].

The Blob appeared in the 2009 superhero film ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'', where he was played by actor [[Kevin Durand]] wearing a fat suit. Wrestler "Giant" Gustav Claude Ouimet had a cameo as Blob in ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]].''

==Publication history==
Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], he first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #3 (January 1964).<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=58}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==

===Early years===
Born in [[Lubbock, Texas]], Fred J. Dukes starts out as a member of a [[circus]] [[sideshow]] under the name "The Blob".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=98}}</ref> His act was that he could remain stationary when others tried to move him. He is detected and contacted by [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] via [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], who sees his performance and tells him that he (Dukes) is a mutant, and asks him to join the X-Men. At the [[X-Mansion]], the other X-Men dislike Dukes for his obnoxious attitude. Iceman uses his power against Dukes to create an ice block around his foot, but the Blob easily escapes. The Blob refuses Xavier's invitation, saying he is better than the other X-Men. When Xavier tries erasing his mind of what has transpired, the Blob escapes the X-Mansion despite the efforts of the Beast and uses the sewer to get away without being followed. He tells the manager of the carnival he is taking over, then gathers up the other circus members and they attack the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters, as he plans to get technology from the X-Men and take over the world. Meanwhile, Xavier works on a device which will allow him to erase the memories of many people. The carnival succeeds in defeating the X-Men despite a warning from Angel. They tie up the X-Men and leave them on the lawn. They then enter the X-Mansion to find the Professor and his technology. Xavier telepathically contacts [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]] and tells her to remove her blindfold using her telekinesis, then levitate a knife from a performer's tent to cut through her bonds, after which she frees the other members. Xavier is able to wipe everyone's minds after the carnival is stopped by a wall of ice, and the Blob goes back to the circus.<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Joining the Brotherhood===
The mutant [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] soon seeks out the Blob to recruit him into his [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], restoring his memory through a jarring blow to the head. The Blob temporarily accepts the invitation, but leaves when it is revealed that Magneto has no real concern for the Blob's safety after he is hit by explosives which were launched at the X-Men. He goes back to the Circus.<ref>''X-Men'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> He teams up with [[Unus the Untouchable|Unus]] due to the alien Lucifer, who soon becomes his confidant.

Marvel Comics.</ref> He becomes part of the plot to assassinate [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Kelly]], the event which leads to the apocalyptic alternate future of ''[[Days of Future Past]]''.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #141-142.

Marvel Comics.</ref> He witnesses the apparent death of Unus, then goes berserk and attacks [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]].<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #91. Marvel Comics.</ref>

He remains with the Brotherhood, becoming a special operative of the federal government when the Brotherhood is reformed as the government-sponsored [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]]. On the team's first mission, they help capture Magneto.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #199.

Marvel Comics.</ref> With Freedom Force, he assists in thwarting a jailbreak from the [[Vault (Marvel Comics)|Vault]].<ref>''Vault Graphic Novel''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After Freedom Force's dissolution, the Blob participates in other versions of the Brotherhood, including one led by [[Toad (Marvel Comics)|Toad]] and another led by Professor X; the Blob takes over as leader of the latter when Xavier leaves.

The psychic entity [[Onslaught (Marvel Comics)|Onslaught]] later recruits Blob, vastly upgrading his powers and abilities (in his powered-up state, his mutation becomes virtually identical to that of [[Phat (comics)|Phat]]). During this time, the Blob fights the various members of [[X-Force]] and is soundly defeated in each encounter. Months later, a powered-down Dukes joins the new Brotherhood led once again by Mystique, alongside Toad, [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], and the [[Mastermind (Martinique Jason)|daughter]] of the original [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]].

When [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]] recreates the Brotherhood of Mutants, Blob offers to join but is quickly dismissed by Exodus, who considers him useless. This is a major blow to Dukes' already weak self-esteem, for which he seeks the counsel of therapist [[Sean Garrison (comics)|Sean Garrison]]. After a session, Blob attacks the Xavier Institute, though he is defeated by the combined efforts of the [[New Mutants]] and the [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]]. He is then arrested by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]

===Post M-Day===
Due to the [[Scarlet Witch]]'s depowering of 90% of Earth's mutants, the Blob is one of the [[Decimation (comics)|thousands to lose their power]], though his epidermis does not shrink to compensate for his loss of mass, leaving him with huge folds of loose skin. The depressed Blob attempts to commit [[suicide]], but his skin folds prevent him from cutting through to any major blood vessels on his throat or wrists.

Someone that resembles the Blob is seen apprehended by the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] and is seen in the Folding Castle's Detention Quadrant.<ref>''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' #103. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Blob later resurfaces as a member of X-Cell, a group of depowered mutants that blames the government for the loss of their powers, attacking [[District X|Mutant Town]] in defiance of the [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]. After mistakenly getting into a fight with [[Rictor]] and [[Jamie Madrox|Multiple Man]] and getting in a cheap shot on Rictor, he stole a car. With fellow X-Cell member [[Fatale (Marvel Comics)|Fatale]], he attempted to flee, eventually hitting an open [[manhole]] (left open earlier in the day by [[Strong Guy]] and [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]]) and causing the car to crash leaving Blob hanging from the car. When both of them ran afoul of [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]], Blob was thrown from the car.

Through unknown means, Dukes loses the excess skin and his fortunes turn in his favor. Now known as '''Freddie Dukes''', he has become a weight-loss guru in Japan, and is to star in an upcoming movie filmed in San Francisco made by [[Kingo Sunen]]. He is also seen with Magneto and the [[High Evolutionary]].<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #500. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the miniseries "Magneto: Not a Hero", [[Joseph (comics)|Joseph]] is resurrected under unknown circumstances and forms a new Brotherhood of Mutants with [[Astra (Marvel Comics)|Astra]] and mutated deformed versions of Blob, [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]], [[Quicksilver (Marvel Comics)|Quicksilver]], [[Scarlet Witch]], and [[Toad (Marvel Comics)|Toad]]. It is soon revealed that these actually are clones created by Joseph.<ref>''Magneto: Not a Hero'' #1-4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In ''Uncanny X-Men'' #16, Fred Dukes is working with Mystique in Genosha and is once again shown as heavily obese and appears to have his powers restored.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #16 (2014). Marvel Comics.</ref> Mystique has supplied him with Mutant Growth Hormones (MGH) extracted from [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]].<!-- different parts of Mystique Dazzler Genosha storyline are spread across various X-Men comics in 2013-2014 (before April) -->{{issue|date=April 2014}}

Blob was later seen on [[Krakoa]]. He and [[Anole (character)|Anole]] become the co-owners and bartenders of the tiki bar called Green Lagoon.<ref>''X-Force'' Vol. 6 #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Blob's [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] physiology grants him a number of advantages. He had superhuman strength, endurance, and great resistance to physical injury. The Blob's elastic, blubbery skin is difficult to penetrate by gunfire, missiles, and even [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]'s claws, though with sufficient force and a favorable angle, the claws can lacerate his flesh.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #225"/> On one occasion, a concentrated optic blast fired by [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] was sufficient to puncture a hole through his shoulder, much to the shock of Dukes himself. The magic swords of both [[Black Raazer]] and the [[Arabian Knight (comics)|Arabian Knight]] were able to harm him.{{Issue|date=October 2009}}

He could also alter his personal mono-directional [[gravitation|gravity]] field beneath himself to make himself virtually immovable as long as he was in contact with the ground, although an incredible force can uproot him, along with a chunk of whatever he is standing on. The only beings on record to have been able to move the Blob against his wishes are the [[Hulk]],<ref name="Marvel Fanfare #7"/> [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]],{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} and [[Strong Guy]] (powered-up near his limit by absorbing [[kinetic energy]]),<ref>''X-Factor'' #107. Marvel Comics.</ref> although [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] has managed to lift Dukes by digging underground and raising the piece of earth Dukes stands on, stating this as an exception to his immovability.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #206"/> Magneto once was able to move the Blob by lifting the ground under the Blob's feet via metal pipes.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> Despite his appearance, the Blob's speed and agility are those of a fairly athletic male of normal stature, a fact which frequently catches his opponents by surprise.

The Blob's superhuman strength greatly increased over the years, in a manner similar to that of the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]. This improvement is said to be a result of his ongoing mutation.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

The Blob is vulnerable to attacks directed at his face, as his eyes, nose, mouth, and ears do not have the same protection as the rest of his body. Dukes is also susceptible to psionic attacks and psychic manipulation, and he can be incapacitated by sensory assaults; for example, [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] was able to render Blob unconscious solely through the use of his sonic scream. On another occasion, [[Sleepwalker (comics)|Sleepwalker]] defeated the Blob by using warp beams to wrap a steel girder around the villain, crushing his blubber and causing him great physical pain. The Hulk once took the opposite approach, harming the Blob by grabbing and stretching his flab. While he is all but invulnerable to direct kinetic attacks, such as punches, kicks or gunshots, he is susceptible to [[concussion]]s and other harm resulting from sufficiently powerful impacts, as [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] knocked him out by luring him underneath a massive bell and then having it dropped on him with the aid of a young female mutant.<ref name="Daredevil #269. Marvel Comics"/>

Dukes can be incapacitated by drinking alcohol, although due to his immense mass, a large amount of alcohol is required.

==Reception==
* In 2018, ''[[CBR.com]]'' ranked Blob 9th in their "Age Of Apocalypse: The 30 Strongest Characters In Marvel's Coolest Alternate World" list.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lealos |first=Shawn S. |date=2018-09-16 |title=Age Of Apocalypse: The 30 Strongest Characters In Marvel's Coolest Alternate World |url=https://www.cbr.com/age-of-apocalypse-characters-ranked/ |access-date=2022-10-11 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Other versions==
===''Age of Apocalypse''===
Blob appears briefly in the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' as a test subject that [[Dark Beast|Henry McCoy]] was toying with in the Breeding Pens in a direct violation of the Kelly Pact that [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] signed in order to keep the Human High Council occupied and at bay while he rallied his forces.<ref>''X-Men: Alpha''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

McCoy considered Blob's mutation useless which enraged Blob. Dukes freed himself, and attacked his experimenter. [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] came to McCoy's rescue, but Dukes proved to be even too much for the Prelate to handle. His pseudo freedom was fleeting because moments later the head of the pens, Havok's older brother [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], showed up to deliver a searing optic blast that would put him back in his place.<ref>''Factor X'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When the [[Age of Apocalypse (limited series)|Age of Apocalypse]] was revisited in the 10th anniversary, Blob was a member of [[Mister Sinister|Sinister]]'s team known as [[Sinister Six]]. It appears that McCoy or Sinister himself had his powers altered in a manner that allowed Blob to project his gravitational field outward. When the Sinister Six met the X-Men in battle, Dukes' new powers were used to sweep the X-Men off their feet with the [[Silver Samurai]] receiving a double dose. [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] attempted to fell the behemoth with multiple punches, but Dukes remained standing regardless of how many hits he got in. It was not until [[Rogue (DC Comics)|Rogue]] stepped in with a punch that had the power necessary to overtake him that the mammoth would topple over. Following the Sinister Six's defeat, Blob managed to escape.<ref>''X-Men: Age of Apocalypse'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later he's seen as a member of the Black Legion, a group of psychotic altered mutants under the supervision of a now insane [[Wolverine (character)|Weapon X]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref> It is also revealed that he left the Age of Apocalypse timeline and joined [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel's]] quest to become the new heir of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. He's seen in Akkaba Metropolis under the North Pole and he was the one to prevent the escape of [[Betsy Braddock|Psylocke]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #15. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the "Final Execution Saga" story line in ''Uncanny X-Force'', Fredrick is part of a new [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] led by [[Daken]] with the aim of taking down X-Force and turning Evan Sabahnur into a new [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #30. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the saga the X-Force team is captured and tortured after [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] from the [[Age of Apocalypse]] universe betrays the team,<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #32. Marvel Comics.</ref> to get his revenge on Fredrick due to him eating his wife Linda. Kurt seemingly succeeds in his goal of revenge by teleporting a live [[shark]] into Fredrick's stomach during a fight with him, causing him to be devoured from within.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #33. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Cable & Deadpool''===
[[Cable & Deadpool|Deadpool's search for Cable]] across alternate timelines forces an encounter with the Blob of "an age of Apocalypse" (not to be confused with the [[Age of Apocalypse|X-Men story arc of the same name]]). In this reality, Blob has taken the mantle of Famine, one of the [[Horsemen of Apocalypse#Other versions|Horsemen of Apocalypse]].<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #15. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===House of M===
Put in an internment camp after [[Bolivar Trask]]'s rise to power in the ''[[House of M]]'' reality, he was freed in Magneto's first major raid on US soil. After being freed, he first took his mutant name, "Blob" and was instrumental in the destruction of several [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]]. He then joined Magneto's mutant group.<ref>''Civil War: House of M'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Blob is seen as a member of the Genoshan Black Ops version of the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]. It was later revealed that Dukes is also a member of an NYPD strike team called the Brotherhood.<ref>''House of M: Avengers'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Marvel Noir''===
Eric Magnus is Chief of Detectives and Fred appears as a member of his Brotherhood, a cabal of bent policemen. He is initially partnered with rookie Detective Peter Magnus, and later with Detective [[Toad (Marvel Comics)|Mortimer Toynbee]].<ref>''X-Men Noir'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Marvel Zombies''===
Blob appears twice in the ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' universe. He is alive when first encountered, but being pursued by several zombie versions of Marvel characters, including Pyro, Black Cat, Iron Fist, Toad and Rhino.<ref>''Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness'' #2-3 (2007). Marvel Comics.</ref> He is later seen as a zombie fighting the X-Men.<ref>''Marvel Zombies'' #5 (May 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
[[Image:UltimateToad.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Ultimate Blob in a chokehold by [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] with [[Toad (Marvel Comics)|Toad's]] tongue around his arm.]]
The [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]] version of Blob, real name '''Franklin Dukes''',<ref>''Ultimatum: X-Men Requiem'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> is a member of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy]]. His powers are similar to that of his [[Earth-616]] counterpart, although he has been moved by a helicopter during the ''[[Ultimate Weapon X|Weapon X]]'' saga, suggesting that he may be less powerful. He seems to eat constantly, and is often seen browsing the internet or chatting to people via instant messaging. One such incident sees the Blob pretend to be a female model/physicist named Naomi who [[Cybersex|cyber-seduces]] the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Man]] [[Beast (Marvel Comics)|Beast]]—leading to the discovery of [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Magneto]]'s survival and to the ''[[Ultimate War]]'' saga. Unlike his Earth-616 counterpart, the Blob may very well have additional superhuman-eating powers as part of his mutation, as not only has he threatened to actually eat his enemies alive, but it was expressly stated that he had personally consumed all of the [[Weapon X]] computers in a matter of moments when the Brotherhood invaded the Weapon X compound to rescue the X-Men.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men Volume 2: Return to Weapon X''. Marvel Comics.</ref> In ''[[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|Ultimatum]]'', the Blob is seen eating the [[Wasp (character)#Ultimate Marvel|Wasp]], proving the cannibalistic claims are true.<ref>''Ultimatum'' #2</ref> However, [[Hank Pym#Ultimate Marvel|Hank Pym]] grows to a gigantic size and bites the Blob's head off in return.<ref>''Ultimatum'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

It has been revealed that Blob was [[Liz Allan#Ultimate Marvel|Liz Allan]]'s estranged genetic father after she discovered [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|her own mutant abilities]]. He impregnated Liz's mother while working for a circus sideshow.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #120. Marvel Comics.</ref> It has also been shown that the Blob fathered a son ('''Theodore "Tubby Teddy" Allan''') by an unknown woman. Teddy is in high school and has his father's same bulky appearance and similar abilities, as he was shot at point blank range and merely said "It tickles".<ref>''Ultimate Comics: X'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> He later joins [[Quicksilver (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Quicksilver]]'s new Brotherhood as the new iteration of Blob.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: X'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Planet X===
Blob is an enforcer on the alternate universe when the Apocalypse Twins skew the time lines and create a mutant utopia.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' 18. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows===
In the second volume of ''Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows'', Blob is seen as a member of the Brotherhood of Mutants.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows'' vol. 2 #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Age of X-Man===
In the alternate universe created by [[Nate Grey]] in ''Age of X-Man,'' Blob is the leader of the X-Tremists. This version of Fred Dukes is a dramatic departure from previous representations; he is "soft-hearted, bookish, kind and gentle".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adventuresinpoortaste.com/2019/05/30/positive-fan-reaction-sort-of-rearranged-my-whole-life-writer-leah-williams-unpacks-age-of-x-man-x-tremists/|title="Positive fan reaction sort of rearranged my whole life" – Writer Leah Williams unpacks 'Age of X-Man: X-Tremists'|last=Hassan|first=Chris|website=AiPT!|date=30 May 2019 |language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-31}}</ref> Blob has romantic feelings for his teammate [[Betsy Braddock]]. According to ''X-Tremists'' writer Leah Williams, "My hope in removing the villainy aspects of his character for X-tremists was to make people confront how they feel about fatness in general by utilizing an intriguing aspect of AoX: there is no bodily prejudice."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/axo2la/i_am_leah_williams_writer_of_marvels_what_if/ehuzac9|title=r/comicbooks - I am Leah Williams, writer of Marvel's What If?

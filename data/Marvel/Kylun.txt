'''Karn''' is a member of the [[Inheritors (comics)|Inheritors]] from the [[Spider-Verse]] storyline who wanders the Multiverse to slay Spider Totems. He first appeared in ''The Superior Spider-Man'' #32 (Sept. 2014),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/21377-what-we-learned-from-marvel-september-2014-solicitations.html|title=What We Learned From MARVEL September 2014 Solicitations}}</ref> and was created by [[Dan Slott]], [[Christos N. Gage]], and [[Giuseppe Camuncoli]].

During the hunt against Master Weaver, he hesitates to deliver the finishing blow, leading to the death of his mother. As a result, he is condemned to wear a mask by his father Solus and exiled to hunt Spider Totems to earn his place back to the family.<ref name="Superior Spider-Man #32">''The Superior Spider-Man'' #32</ref>

The time-displaced [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] ([[Doctor Octopus|Otto Octavius]]'s mind in [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]'s body) later discovered Karn. Assembling an army of Spider-Men, the Superior Spider-Man and his team ambushed Karn while hunting the Spider-Man of Earth-2818, but despite Karn continuing to gain the upper hand, the Spider-Men only escaped when two of Karn's estranged siblings showed up and began fighting.<ref name="Superior Spider-Man #32"/> Karn later joins the Spider-Men in their fight against the Inheritors.<ref>''Spider-Verse Team-Up'' #3</ref>

Karn realizes that Master Weaver is his future self. He establishes a new team of multiversal spider-heroes called the Warriors of the Great Web, consisting of [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Mayday Parker]], [[Spider-Ham]], [[Spider-Man Noir]], [[Spider-Man: India|Spider-Man India]], and [[Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)|Spider-Gwen]].

During the "Electroverse saga", an alliance of counterparts of [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Max Dillon]] invades Loomworld, damaging the great web while forcing the Web-Warriors to retreat to Earth-803. Karn and an alternate version of [[Doctor Octopus]] managed to fix the Web, but tangle it at the same time, causing the Web Warriors to become split between realities. Karn's reconnection of Earth-803 into the web also causes an earthquake that frees the Electros caught by the Web-Warriors.<ref>''Web Warriors'' #10</ref>

During the ''[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]'' storyline, Karn welcomes [[Kaine Parker]], but soon realizes that he no longer has the powers of the Other and is now dying from a [[Carrion (comics)|Carrion]] virus, and cannot go back to his Earth lest someone catch it. Karn shows Kaine many realities with zombie apocalypses caused by this disease, and Kaine decides to visit these realities to find a way to stop it. Kaine tries to keep himself hidden from the Web Warriors while researching, but is caught by Spider-Gwen.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #2</ref>

During the "[[Spider-Geddon]]" storyline, each of the Spider-Men and Master Weaver has been keeping an eye on Earth-3145 by sending different Spider-Bots to check on them, discovering that while alive, the Inheritors have gotten malnourished from lack of spider life-forces. Unknown to the Spider-Men and apparently to Master Weaver himself, the Inheritors are collecting the heads of the Spider-Bots with Jennix stating that they now have the resources they need.<ref>''Spider-Geddon'' #0. Marvel Comics.</ref> When [[Spider-UK]] and Master Weaver get alerted to an Inheritor Cloning Engine on Earth-616, the two of them figure out what is happening. On Earth-3145, Jennix has put the Spider-Bot heads to good use by harvesting their transmitters. As they are unable to send a kill signal to the Inheritor Cloning Engine, Spider-UK advises Master Weaver to call the Web Warriors. When Master Weaver states that nobody can fight the Inheritors and win, Spider-UK states that they'll die trying to keep another world from being destroyed.<ref>''The Superior Octopus'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Karn is then confronted by Verna for having sided with the Web Warriors as they fight to the death. After Karn stabs Verna, she still feeds on him as he is now a Spider-Totem.<ref>''Spider-Geddon'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Karn's dead body is found by [[Alternative versions of Green Goblin#Spider-Geddon|Spider-Nor-Man]], it is devoured by Spiders-Man of Earth-11580.<ref>''Spider-Geddon'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

; Powers and abilities
Like the rest of the Inheritors, Karn can drain the life force from other beings through physical contact. Depending on the power of the individual he drains, his powers and vitality can increase substantially. He also has superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, and durability. He has a staff that emits a unique energy signature capable of vaporizing people.{{issue|date=June 2018}}

As Master Weaver, Karn threads the Web of Life and Destiny, gaining dominion over various realities. He can open portals at his command or alter realities.

When she first appeared, Karnilla saved Balder the Brave from assassination by Loki.

'''Kly'bn''' is a fictional deity created by [[Greg Pak]] and [[Fred Van Lente]] and first appeared in ''[[Incredible Hercules]]'' #117, while being first mentioned in ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]'' vol. 2 #14 in contrast to his wife '''Sl'gur't''' who first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' Annual #24 of July, 1991.

Millions of years ago, after the [[Celestials]] had created the Skrull Eternals, [[Deviants (comics)|Deviants]] and Prime, the Deviant Skrulls wiped out the other two branches believing that they themselves were the superior branch, leaving only one member of each wiped branch. Kly'bn was the last Skrull Eternal, who convinced the Deviant Skrulls and their Queen Sl'gur't that killing him would be killing themselves, as he was the embodiment of the idea of the Skrull and it was his destiny to lead the Skrulls into changing the other worlds with their truth. Sl'gur't embraced his ideas and became lovers with the two becoming gods of the Skrull Pantheon. Since Kly'bn was unable to shapeshift, Sl'gur't vowed to never keep her form for too long in contrast to her husband.<ref name="IH117120">''The Incredible Hercules'' #117-120. Marvel Comics</ref> The couple together wrote the Book of World Skrull, where there was written three prophesies. These prophesies told about the eventual destruction of the Skrull homeworld and about Earth being the new home for the Skrulls. These prophesies were the main reason of the events of "[[Secret Invasion]]", being a holy war for the Skrulls.<ref name="IH117120"/><ref>''Skrulls!'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref> When the [[God Squad (comics)|God Squad]] arrived at their fortress via [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]]'s realm, Kly'bn and Sl'gur't were forced into battling them. Sl'gur't was eaten by the Demogorge, but since she represented multiple different deities, the Demogorge exploded due for being too much. Sl'gur't then started a shapeshifting battle against [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]], with them copying each other. Eventually, Mikaboshi in Sl'gur't form killed Sl'gur't who was in Mikaboshi's form, allowing him to replace her. After Kly'bn killed [[Ajak]], [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] started battling Kly'bn. Hercules was able to defeat Kly'bn, after [[Snowbird (comics)|Snowbird]] impaled him with the spine of the Demogorge.<ref name="IH117120"/>

Kly'bn reappeared as one of the dead deities serving Amatsu-Mikabosi during "[[Chaos War]]".<ref>''Chaos War: Chaos King'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref>

Kobik is a physical manifestation of a [[Cosmic Cube]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

The character, created by [[Chris Bachalo]], first appeared in ''[[Marvel NOW!|Marvel NOW! Point One]]'' #1 (June 2015).

Within the context of the stories, Kobik originated from a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] project using fragments of Cosmic Cubes. The pieces merge into a single being that adopts the form of a child. Kobik becomes a member of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' vol. 3 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During her time affiliated with S.H.I.E.L.D., Kobik is involved in the Pleasant Hill project, where supervillains are taken to a pre-created town and brainwashed to act as normal civilians. At the same time, Kobik comes into contact with the Red Skull, the Cube's past experience with the Skull giving her a certain attachment to him. Using his influence on her, the Skull is able to convince her of Hydra being a noble organization. Kobik later makes contact with the elderly Steve Rogers during a stand-off where his life is in danger, and as a consequence of the Skull's manipulation, she not only reverts him to his youthful state but also rewrites his history so that he has been a Hydra sleeper agent since childhood. As Hydra's "Secret Empire" rises to power in the United States, Kobik begins to regretfully rewrite Rogers' mind, but it is revealed that the memory of his original, good conscious has remained hidden in her mind. The original Steve Rogers tries to convince Kobik to undo her mistakes, but she believes it is too late and is frightened of Hydra Rogers. Making things worse, in the real world [[Arnim Zola]] implants a Cosmic Cube into Rogers' physical body during the Resistance's hopeful raid on Hydra's main base, led by [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]]. However, the good Rogers manages to get through to her, and eventually, they are both saved by Bucky Barnes and Scott Lang, who takes away Hydra Rogers’ ability to use both the Cosmic Cube and Mjolnir, allowing the real Captain America to defeat his mind-altered self. After Hydra Rogers is defeated, Kobik restores the history of the world, although she leaves some aspects intact from the Hydra-created reality.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #8-10</ref>

===Algrim===
Kurse was originally the most powerful of a race of Dark Elves and known as Algrim the Strong<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=184}}</ref> He is coerced by the Dark Elf ruler [[Malekith the Accursed]] to fight the Asgardian God of Thunder and [[superhero]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Malekith, however, betrays Algrim while he is fighting Thor, and in a bid to destroy the Thunder God orders that a pitfall beneath the two be opened. Thor saves himself courtesy of his mystical hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]], while Algrim falls into lava. Algrim's enchanted armor saves his life, but he is critically injured and develops [[amnesia]] from the shock, and is left with an obsessive desire for revenge.<ref>''Thor'' #347-348 (Sep.-Oct. 1984). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Algrim is later healed by the cosmic entity the [[Beyonder]], who transforms him into the much more powerful being called Kurse. The Beyonder transports Kurse to Earth to battle Thor, but Kurse mistakes Thor's ally [[Beta Ray Bill]] for Thor and battles him.<ref>''[[Secret Wars II]]'' #4-6 (Oct.-Dec. 1985).

With the assistance of Power Pack, Thor and Bill are able to overcome Kurse, and Thor helps him remember that it was Malekith, not Thor, who is to blame for his suffering.<ref>''The Mighty Thor'' #363 (Jan. 1986)</ref> The Beyonder then transports Kurse to [[Asgard (comics)#The Nine Worlds|Hel]] at Thor's suggestion, to frustrate [[Hela (comics)|Hela]], the Goddess of Death.<ref>''Thor'' #363 (Jan. 1986).

Kurse later confronts and severely beats Loki, who had been disguised as Malekith. Drawing off, he leaves Loki injured and finds someone who seems to be [[Balder (comics)|Balder the Brave]], surrounded by legions of [[Asgardians (Marvel Universe)|Asgardians]]. He barrels through them and slays his target, who turns out to be the true Malekith. After repenting, he is granted citizenship among the [[Asgardian (comics)|Asgardians]].<ref>''Thor'' #367-368 (May-Jun. 1986). Marvel Comics.</ref>

He is designated as the guardian of the children of Asgard after helping to protect [[Volstagg]]'s daughter and adopted sons during a plague,<ref>''Thor'' #382. Marvel Comics.</ref> and loyally serves Asgard until the time of [[Ragnarök|Ragnarok]]. At the time of Ragnarok, all the Asgardians apparently perish, with the exception of Thor.<ref>''Thor'' #85 vol. 2 (Dec. 2004). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Kurse is later captured by Malekith, who strips him of the armor. Algrim is sent to Nastrond Prison where he is forced to serve out the rest of the sentence of Wazaria, a former member of the League of Realms. Malekith forces Wazaria to don the armor, transforming her into the new Kurse. Before he is imprisoned, Algrim encourages his successor to kill herself the first chance she gets.<ref name="The Mighty Thor #14">''The Mighty Thor'' vol. 2 #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Waziria===
Waziria is a Dark Elf witch of the Dove Gut Tribe in Svartalfheim.<ref name="Thor: God of Thunder #16">''Thor: God of Thunder'' #16. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Malekith escaped from his imprisonment and attacked his village, he cut off Waziria's left arm when using her as a hostage when Thor and his fellow Asgardians arrived.<ref>''Thor: God of Thunder'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref> After recuperating, Waziria joined up with the League of Realms to hunt down Malekith.<ref>''Thor: God of Thunder'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When the League of Realms split, only Waziria remained with Thor. During a meeting with the Dark Elf ruling council called the Council of the Unhallowed, Thor accused Waziria of being the traitor and that she gave Malekith the information to stay one step ahead of him, only for both to learn that it was Thor himself who had been bugged. Malekith then makes himself known.<ref name="Thor: God of Thunder #16"/> Before Malekith can kill Thor, the League of Realms showed up to help fight Malekith. The Council of the Unhallowed made the decision to side with Malekith. When the Congress of the Worlds planned to have Malekith rule Svartalfheim after he is done with his life sentence in Nastrond Prison, Malekith made Waziria his proxy while Malekith named Scumtongue his senator for the Congress of the Worlds.<ref>''Thor: God of Thunder'' #17. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After stripping Algrim of his armor, Malekith transformed Waziria into the new Kurse while Algrim takes Waziria's place in Nastrond Prison.<ref name="The Mighty Thor #14"/>

'''K'ythri''' is fictional deity created by [[Warren Ellis]] and [[Carlos Pacheco]] and first appeared as a depiction along with his wife '''Sharra''' in ''[[Starjammers]]'' #1.

According to the Shi'ar mythology, the two chief deities, K'ythri and Sharra, were the creators of the universe. At first, they were enemies to each other, but were then forced into marriage, in which they found love. At their day of marriage, K'ythri presented her the [[M'Kraan Crystal]] as their sign of love.<ref>''Starjammers'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref><ref>''X-Men: Emperor Vulcan'' #1-5. Marvel Comics</ref>

They were worshipped by the Shi'ar for millennia, until they were killed by [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]],<ref>''Assault on New Olympus'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref> but it seems that they had come back to life.<ref name="MTV2159">''The Mighty Thor'' vol. 2 #15-19. Marvel Comics</ref>

They were then convinced by [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] that they needed to force the new [[Jane Foster (comics)|Thor]] to take part on their Challenge of Gods in order to prove their superiority. Even though they outscored Thor, thanks to their disposition to cause mass suffering in order complete certain tasks, the challenge's officiate Shadrak declared Thor as the winner, since she inspired the [[Asgardians (comics)|Asgardians]] gods to help her in defense.<ref name="MTV2159"/>
Infuriated, they called upon "their sister" the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]] to destroy all reality, but with the help of [[Quentin Quire]], Thor and the Asgardians appeased the Phoenix Force. Sharra and K'ythri were then imprisoned in Omnipotence City, since they had broken the divine law.<ref name="MTV2159"/>

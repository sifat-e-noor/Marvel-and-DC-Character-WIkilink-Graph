'''Knull''' is a [[fictional]] [[supervillain]]&nbsp;appearing in [[American comic books]]&nbsp;published by [[Marvel Comics]], commonly in association with [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] and [[Carnage (character)|Carnage]], and later retroactively established as an unseen enemy of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], as he was behind [[Gorr the God Butcher]] and his mission to hunt down and kill various deities. The character is depicted as an evil deity who created the weapon known as All-Black the Necrosword and the alien races known as the [[Symbiote (comics)|Klyntar/Symbiotes]] and Exolons. The character would go on to play a more important role in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Publication history==
The character was first introduced in ''Venom'' vol. 4 #3 (Aug 2018), giving a nod to a nameless being appearing in ''Thor: God of Thunder'' #6.<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=205}}</ref> The character would be mentioned in various issues of ''[[Venom (comic book)|Web of Venom]]'', ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' and "[[War of the Realms]]". After that, Knull was the main antagonist in [[Donny Cates]]’ ''[[Silver Surfer (comic book)|Silver Surfer]]: Black'' #1.

Knull returned in ''[[King in Black]]'' as the main antagonist, which centers on his attack on Earth with his symbiote army.

==Fictional character biography==
=== Origin ===
Knull is a primordial deity that came into being following the destruction of the sixth iteration of the cosmos. <ref name="King in Black #1">''King in Black'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> He was originally content to drift through "the endless void" until the [[Celestials (comics)|Celestials]] arrived and began creating the 7th iteration of cosmos – the Marvel Universe. Awakened by the "Light of Creation" and outraged by his kingdom of darkness being despoiled, Knull retaliated by creating All-Black the Necrosword – which he used to eliminate one of the Celestials. Seeing this, the other Celestials banished Knull and the severed celestial head deeper into the Void. He then used the celestial head to forge the [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] and combined it with the cosmic energies of the head, which would eventually become [[Knowhere]].<ref>{{cite web|url = https://twitter.com/Doncates/status/1022604840051109888|title = Yep! The severed celestial head in VENOM #4 would someday erode and decay and become Knowhere! Good catch!|last = Cates|first = Donny|publisher = [[Twitter]]|date = 26 July 2018 |website = twitter.com|access-date = 27 July 2018}}</ref> In doing so, he unintentionally gave the symbiotes their weaknesses to high sonic frequencies and fire. He created a symbiote armor and, with All-Black, started killing the other deities, until he crash-landed on an unnamed planet where [[Gorr the God Butcher|Gorr]] took All-Black from the incapacitated Knull.<ref>''Thor: God of Thunder'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Knull eventually reawakened and discovered he could bond his living abyss to "lesser creatures" and control their new forms as vessels. He created an army of symbiotes with himself in the center of the hive mind and used them to spread across the universe, thus establishing the Symbiote Hive and killing the "light and creation" in the process. He continued killing gods, while also enslaving others. At some point, he was approached by the time-displaced [[Silver Surfer]] who had been weakened after Silver Surfer had created a little star in order to free a world from Knull's control. After a brief fight, Knull was able to bond a symbiote to Silver Surfer, but the latter was saved by [[Ego, the Living Planet]].<ref>''Silver Surfer: Black'' #1-2. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Knull reached the Surfer, he tried to defeat him and re-infect the Surfer with his abyss, but the Surfer, who had gathered the energy of the cosmos, created a star which was enough to defeat Knull.<ref>''Silver Surfer: Black'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When one dragon-like symbiote arrived on medieval Earth to claim the planet as part of the Symbiote Hive, a young [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] arrived in aid of the Viking villagers and defeated the dragon, which the villagers called "Grendel", causing the connection between Knull and the symbiote hive mind to break. The symbiotes that were scattered over the universe, now free from Knull's control, began bonding to benevolent hosts and learning about the [[Divine light|Light]]. The symbiotes rebelled against their god and trapped him inside an artificial planet formed of billions of symbiotes, which they called Klyntar — "cage" in their language.<ref>''Venom'' vol. 4 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== Meeting Eddie Brock ===
After thousands of years, [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] discovered the body of the Grendel and bound the pieces of the dragon to soldiers in order to create Super-Soldiers to fight in the [[Vietnam War]]. The procedure was dubbed the [[Weapon Plus#Weapon V|Sym-Soldier program]]. This reawakened Knull, allowing him to take control of the Sym-soldiers who went rogue before being captured by [[Nick Fury]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]], except one piece, named Rex, which escaped Knull's control.<ref>''Web of Venom Ve'nam'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Years later, [[Eddie Brock]] ([[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]) unknowingly freed the dragon and, after a battle against Eddie and [[Miles Morales|Spider-Man]], the dragon began searching for Rex in order to free Knull.<ref>''Venom'' vol. 4 #1-3. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, Venom merged with Rex and eventually trapped the Grendel in a blast furnace, incinerating it and Rex both.<ref>''Venom'' vol. 4 #5-6. Marvel Comics.</ref> Afterward, the [[Maker (Reed Richards)|Maker]] and Project Oversight retrieve the Grendel's codex from the furnace.<ref>''Venom'' vol. 4 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== Freed by Carnage ===
In ''Carnage Born'', after [[Scorn (Marvel Comics)|Scorn]] joined a cult worshiping Knull, they stole the Grendel's codex and [[Cletus Kasady]]'s deceased body, and after implanting the codex inside Cletus, the [[Carnage (character)|Carnage]] symbiote's codex was absorbed by Grendel, causing Grendel to become god-like. After the contact with Knull, Cletus decided to free Knull by collecting every codex of every host who had at some point bonded to symbiotes in order to overload the symbiote hive mind and scatter the Klyntar.<ref>''Web of Venom Carnage Born'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> After Cletus reunited with [[Doppelganger (comics)|Doppelganger]] and [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]], they reformed the cult dedicated to worshipping Knull. They then returned to Doverton, Colorado, where they got the codices from citizens and animals who were infected by Carnage during ''Carnage USA''.<ref>''Web of Venom Cult of Carnage'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During "[[Absolute Carnage]]", as Carnage grew stronger, so did the connection between Knull and the symbiotes, as witnessed when [[Phage (comics)|Phage]], [[Agony (comics)|Agony]], [[Lasher (comics)|Lasher]], [[Riot (comics)|Riot]] and [[Scream (comics)|Scream]] also became corrupt.<ref>''Absolute Carnage: Separation Anxiety'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref><ref>''Absolute Carnage: Scream'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref> Knull was finally reawakened after Dark Carnage tricked Eddie into killing him after claiming the remaining codices. Knull promptly destroyed Klyntar, manifesting a suit of draconic armor and coalescing its constituent symbiotes into a fleet of symbiote-dragons. Meanwhile, Knull was tracked down by [[Wraith (Zak-Del)|Wraith]] who wanted Knull to remove the Exolon (parasites that attach to a host while feeding on their soul) from his body.<ref>''Guardians of Galaxy'' vol. 5 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Knull revealed to Wraith that Exolons were just his failed experiments on symbiotes and he dumped that "trash" in The Exoteric Latitude, he stripped the Exolon from Wraith's body turning it into his sword and kicked off Wraith into the space.<ref>''Web of Venom: Wraith'' #1</ref> Soon, he resumed his campaign against the light all the while journeying to Earth,<ref>''Absolute Carnage'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> using his living abyss to claim entire planets to his cause,<ref>''Incoming'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> while haunting Eddie with pointed nightmares,<ref>''Venom'' vol. 4 #21. Marvel Comics.</ref> and briefly imposed his influence over Dylan Brock to ensure that he would pledge allegiance to the Symbiote Imperium.<ref>''Venom'' vol. 4 #22</ref><ref>''Web of Venom: The Good Son'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== Conquering Earth and death ===
At the time when the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] were investigating the death of Zn'rx Emperor Stote during the Galactic Council's meeting at the Proscenium and find that the [[Chitauri]] Peacekeeper and the Profiteer were responsible sometime after the events of the "[[Empyre]]" storyline, Zoralis Gupa of the planet Silnius takes an urgent call while mentioning to the person on the other side to warn all neighboring systems. He tells Victoria that it's the End of Everything as different planets are starting to die in the planets owned by the Shi'ar, the Kree/Skrull Alliance, and the Zn'rx while rendering the galactic economy fragile enough to go bankrupt. Knowing that she won't make a profit, the Profiteer teleports Peacekeeper and the bio-bomb away. While thanking Zoralis Gupa for fooling the Profiteer with the bluff, Zoralis Gupa states to Super-Skrull and everyone present that something darker than [[Galactus]] is destroying the worlds and its name is Knull.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 6 #8. Marvel Comics.</ref> Emperor [[Hulkling]] dispatched [[Talos the Untamed|Talos]] to investigate the Kree and Skrull bases that went dark with Av-Rom, Keeyah, M'lanz, Virtue, and Tarna. Two days later, a Kree/Skrull Alliance armada headed by General Kalamari finds Talos' escape pod. After recuperating in the sick bay, Talos recaps to Kalamari about what happened on his mission that involved an encounter with Knull. Talos then informs Kalamari that his distress beacon on his escape pod is a warning that Knull is coming. Outside the ship, Knull is riding a Symbiote Dragon as he swoops in for an attack.<ref>''Web of Venom: Empyre's End'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Sensing Knull coming at the start of the "[[King in Black]]" storyline, Eddie Brock alerts the Avengers. Knull unleashes the Symbiote Dragons on Earth as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], the [[Fantastic Four]], and the [[X-Men]] fight them even when Knull is shown to have [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] Arishem the Judge and Tefral the Surveyor possessed by his symbiotes. When [[Captain America]] gives the command to the other heavy hitter they enlisted, it turns out to be the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]]. He takes Knull into Earth's orbit and tried to do the same thing he once did to Carnage only for Knull to do a reversal upon being familiar with what happened to Carnage that time. Knull breaks Sentry and assimilates the Void into him upon it emerging from Sentry's body. Venom and Captain America react to this as [[Iron Man]] urges them to retreat. Knull then proceeds to have his Symbiote Dragons form a sphere around Earth to cut it off from the Sun and has the living abyss swallow some of the superheroes including [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] which [[Professor X]] reacts to. As Venom, Eddie goes to confront Knull and offer his services to him. Knull grabs Venom as he recognizes Eddie as the one who killed Grendel, then he states to Eddie that the Brock he is looking for is Dylan Brock. When Eddie begs for Knull to take him instead, Knull rips the Venom symbiote off him and absorbs it into his body while planning to absorb Dylan into him as well. Eddie is then dropped by Knull into the symbiote-covered streets below.<ref name="King in Black #1"/> Knull finds out where Dylan is and is about to get him when Thor arrives. Together, Thor and Dylan help free some of the infected heroes including the [[Hulk]]. Thor and Knull fight and Thor gains the upper hand until Knull distracts Thor by bringing in his symbiote-possessed Celestials and stabs Thor in the back.<ref>''King in Black'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Knull plans to control Dylan since the latter has the Symbiote codex, but Dylan fights back freeing [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Invisible Woman]], [[Doctor Strange]], [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], and the [[Human Torch]]. Doctor Strange morphs into a stronger form and together the heroes fight back against the symbiotes. [[Namor (comics)|Namor]], Thor and Storm deal heavy damage while [[Jean Grey]]'s psychic powers immobilize Knull, seeing Knull's past and realizing that the God of Light (another name for the Enigma Force) is the one thing that can take down Knull before passing out. Silver Surfer arrives to where the Enigma Force is and frees it from the Symbiotes. Knull reels in pain and Eddie is chosen to be the new [[Captain Universe]].<ref>''King in Black'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> As Silver Surfer faces off against him, Knull recalls his previous fight against him. Through the God of Light, Silver Surfer assumes a chrome form and turns his surfboard into a sword while Knull transforms his armor into one that would enable him to combat Silver Surfer. As Knull begins to fight Silver Surfer, the members of the Avengers, Fantastic Four and X-Men charge towards Knull so that they can aid Silver Surfer. Just then, Venom appears having been transformed into Captain Universe stating that he'll handle Knull from here. As Knull claims that he has killed Venom many times, Venom manages to make use of Mjolnir and Silver Surfer's surfboard which he then merged into a battle axe that is in the shape of Venom's spider emblem. Using his battle axe, Venom starts to shred his way through the Symbiote Dragons upon noting that Knull has become afraid of him. Knull even unleashes a Symbiote-controlled Celestial to aid him, only for Venom to behead it. As Venom rips off Knull's armor, Knull states that the darkness is in Dylan. Venom then picks up Knull, flies into the air, and punches through the Symbiote barrier surrounding Earth, where Knull states that the Void is eternal and the abyss has teeth. Venom then states he doesn't care if he is right as he plunges his hand into the sun and uses the Uni-Power to vaporize Knull. As a result of Knull's death, the Venom Symbiote translates to Eddie the language of the hostless Symbiotes and the Symbiote Dragons that he has become the new God of the Symbiotes now that they are free of Knull's control.<ref>''King in Black'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
{{See|Symbiote (comics)#Powers and abilities}}
Knull is a primordial deity, having super strength, agility, immortality<ref>{{cite tweet |user= Doncates|number= 1120132305777983489|date= 21 April 2019|title= Nothing can kill Knull}}</ref> and healing capability. He possesses Supreme Umbrakinesis, as he can manifest darkness to create weapons and creatures, whom he calls the "Living Abyss". He can control these and augment their powers. This allowed Venom to unlock new abilities, and allowed one of Knull's dragons to be as fast as the Silver Surfer and unharmed by fire and high frequency sound. Knull also possesses limited shapeshifting ability, including turning his human-like mouth into fanged jaws with an elongated tongue — a feature passed on to the symbiotes. He is an expert combatant, utilizing All-Black to kill [[Celestials (comics)|Celestials]] and other gods, while wearing an armor made from symbiote-matter. Knull's armor is decorated with a red dragon and spiral emblem, which was based on Spiral of [[Carcosa]] from ''[[True Detective]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://stegmanandfriends.podbean.com/e/venom-boiz-wdonny-cates-venom-1-q-and-a//|title=VENOM BOIZ! w/Donny Cates: Venom (2018) #1 Director's Commentary|date=22 June 2019}}</ref>

Despite his severed connection to the symbiotes, his influence can still be observed as when [[Gorr the God Butcher|Gorr]], [[Galactus#King Thor|Old Galactus]],<ref>''Thor: God of Thunder'' #24.

Marvel Comics.</ref>

== Reception ==
In his early appearance, the character was received well, with [[Comic Book Resources]] drawing comparison with two other Marvel Villains: [[Morlun]] and [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/venom-knull-symbiote-god-explainer|title=Meet Knull, Venom's God of the Symbiotes|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources|CBR]]|date=27 June 2018|access-date=27 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190324111457/https://www.cbr.com/venom-knull-symbiote-god-explainer/|archive-date=24 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> However, Comic Book Resources also criticized the character's design as being unoriginal and similar to most other villains, and not matching his nature, saying that the character would have been better if he would have been more similar to his creation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/venom-knull-remained-hidden/amp/|title=Venom's Symbiote God Should Have Remained in the Shadows|access-date=2020-07-11|website=CBR|first=Timothy|last=Donohoo|date=9 August 2020}}</ref> [[Bleeding Cool]] stated about the history that "It’s an engaging new story, and it redefines the symbiotes for the Marvel Universe."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2018/07/28/venom-4-review-the-origins-of-knull-and-the-symbiotes/|title=Venom #4 Review: The Origins of Knull and the Symbiotes|publisher=[[Bleeding Cool]]|date=28 July 2018|access-date=28 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190512214504/https://www.bleedingcool.com/2018/07/28/venom-4-review-the-origins-of-knull-and-the-symbiotes/|archive-date=12 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Knull was ranked number one in [[IGN]]'s list of ''Marvel's Most Powerful Symbiotes''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://m.ign.com/articles/2018/10/19/venom-movie-marvels-most-powerful-symbiotes-ranked|title=Marvel's most powerful symbiotes|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=19 October 2018|access-date=19 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190520021523/https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/19/venom-movie-marvels-most-powerful-symbiotes-ranked|archive-date=20 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

The character received special attention in Sweden and Norway due to the word {{lang|gmq|knull}} being the noun form of "fuck" (referring to copulation) in Swedish and Norwegian.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bleedingcool.com/comics/knull-venom-3-spoilers/|title=The Rather Sweary True Meaning of Knull|date=June 30, 2018|access-date=2020-07-02|website=Bleeding Cool|last=Johnston|first=Rich|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200702202541/https://bleedingcool.com/comics/knull-venom-3-spoilers/|archive-date=2 July 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.expressen.se/dinapengar/knull-is-coming-akta-er-for-marvel-comics-superbov/|title="Knull is coming" – akta er för Marvel Comics superbov|date=July 2, 2020|access-date=2020-07-02|website=[[Expressen]]|last=Dahlskog|first=Noréa|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200702203111/https://www.expressen.se/dinapengar/knull-is-coming-akta-er-for-marvel-comics-superbov/|archive-date=2 July 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Marvel Comics: "Knull is coming – 2020"|url=https://www.vg.no/i/g75Qy5|access-date=2020-07-03|website=www.vg.no|language=nb}}</ref>

== In other media ==
=== Television ===
Knull makes his animated debut in the [[Disney XD]] animated series ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]].'' He first appears in the promo "The Secret Story of Venom", where [[Venom (character)|Venom]] explains the [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiotes]]' origins as the Klyntar, living weapons used by Knull to wage a crusade against the [[Celestials (comics)|Celestials]]. Despite their victories, Knull eventually abandoned the Symbiote Sisters after deeming his first creations useless to him. The Symbiote Sisters went on to crash-land on an alien planet, replicate into several spawn, and bond with the native inhabitants in a bid for finding a harmonic purpose in life.

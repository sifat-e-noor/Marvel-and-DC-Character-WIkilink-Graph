'''Rogue''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], commonly in association with the [[X-Men]]. Created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Michael Golden (comics)|Michael Golden]], the character first appeared in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|Avengers Annual]]'' #10 (1981) as a villain, but joins the X-Men soon thereafter.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men' 1983">''Uncanny X-Men'' #171 (July 1983). Marvel Comics</ref> Rogue has been one of the most prominent members of the X-Men since the her debut in 1981. 

Rogue is part of a subspecies of humans called [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]]s, who are born with superhuman abilities. She has the ability to absorb and sometimes also remove the memories, [[physical strength]], and superpowers of anyone she touches. Initially, Rogue considered her powers to be a curse. For most of her life, she limits her physical contact with others, including her on-off love interest and eventual husband, [[Gambit (Marvel Comics)|Gambit]]. However, after many years, Rogue finally gains full control over her mutant ability.

Hailing from the fictional Caldecott County, Mississippi, Rogue is the X-Men's self-described [[Southern belle]]. A [[runaway (dependent)|runaway]], she is adopted by [[Mystique (character)|Mystique]] of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] and grows up as a villain. After Rogue permanently absorbs [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]]'s psyche and [[Kree]] powers, she reforms and turns to the X-Men, fearing for her sanity. Rogue's real name and early history were not revealed until over 20 years after her introduction. Until the backstory provided by [[Robert Rodi]] in the ongoing ''Rogue'' series, which began in September 2004, Rogue's background was only hinted at. Her name is revealed as '''Anna Marie''', although her surname is still unknown. She has sometimes adopted the name '''[[Mystique (character)|Raven]]''', which is the first name of her foster mother, Mystique.<ref name="rogue#2">{{cite comic| Writer=[[Tony Bedard]] | Penciller=Karl Moline | Inker=Rick Magyar | Story=Forget-Me-Not | Title=Rogue | Volume=1 | Issue=2 | Date=August 2004 | Publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> Her visual cue is often the white streak that runs through her hair and her gloves. 

She has been featured in most of the [[X-Men in other media#Team line-ups/compositions|X-Men animated series]], and various [[video game]]s. Following her introduction in 1981, Rogue has been labeled as one of Marvel's most notable and powerful female heroes.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1">{{Cite web |last=Lealos |first=Shawn S. |date=2019-06-25 |title=Ranking The 20 Strongest Female Superheroes |url=https://www.cbr.com/ranking-strongest-female-superheroes/ |access-date=2022-09-09 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite web |last=shubham |date=2021-05-13 |title=Best Female Marvel Characters (The Handpicked List) |url=https://womenintheworld.org/female-marvel-characters/ |access-date=2022-09-09 |website=Women In The World |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Schlesinger |first=Alex |date=2022-08-28 |title=Rogue's Ultimate Form Unlocks Her Full Potential in X-Men Fanart |url=https://screenrant.com/xmen-rogue-ultimate-form-powers-fanart/ |access-date=2022-10-10 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref>

In the [[20th Century Fox]] [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]], she was portrayed by [[Anna Paquin]]. 

==Publication history==
Rogue was first slated to appear in ''[[Ms. Marvel]]'' #25 (1979) (and artwork for the first half of the story was completed),{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} but the book's abrupt cancellation left her original introduction story unpublished for over a decade until it was printed in ''Marvel Super Heroes'' #11 in 1992, where she absorbed her current powers permanently from Ms. Marvel.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Draven |first=Derek |date=2021-07-16 |title=X-Men: 10 Things Only Comic Book Fans Know About Rogue |url=https://screenrant.com/x-men-rogue-comic-book-facts-trivia/ |access-date=2022-10-17 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref> Rogue's first published appearance was in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|Avengers Annual]]'' #10 (1981).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=203}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Connolly |first=Spencer |date=2022-06-13 |title=Rogue Only Joined the X-Men Because of One Avenger |url=https://screenrant.com/rogue-xmen-team-member-captain-marvel-comics/ |access-date=2022-10-10 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref> Her second appearance and first cover appearance was ''Rom #31 (Jun 1982)'' tied with ''[[Uncanny X-Men|Uncanny X-men]] #158 (Jun 1982)'', but #158 is also her first X-Book appearance and Rogue joined the X-Men in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #171 (1983). Rogue has also had two miniseries and one ongoing title.

Claremont also revealed that Rogue's physical appearance was originally intended to be modeled on [[Grace Jones]]; however, artist Michael Golden did not know what Jones looked like.<ref name="ClarionLedger">{{cite web |title=X-Men's Rogue: From Mississippi and proud of it |url=http://www.clarionledger.com/story/magnolia/entertainment/2016/06/23/x-mens-rogue-mississippi-and-proud/86179080/ |access-date=June 23, 2016 |website=The Clarion-Ledger |publisher=clarionledger.com}}</ref> Chris Claremont said in June 2016 that, had he not left Marvel in 1991, Mystique would have been Rogue's real mother. It is a storyline that appeared in a 2009 run of the series "[[X-Men Forever]]".<ref name="ClarionLedger" />

Rogue's real name and early history were not revealed until more than 20 years after her introduction. Until the back story provided by Robert Rodi in the ongoing ''Rogue'' series, begun in September 2004, her background was only hinted at. This resulted in Rodi's version of Rogue's origins inadvertently conflicting with earlier information. In ''X-Men Unlimited'' #4, Scott Lobdell indicates that Rogue ran away from her father after her mutant powers manifested, but in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #182, Rogue reflects that she never knew her father because he had left before she was born, and several issues, including ''Uncanny X-Men'' #178 and ''X-Men'' #93, indicate that Rogue was taken in by Mystique and Destiny before her mutation became active.

Rogue was a regular character in ''[[Uncanny Avengers]]'' (2012), beginning with issue #1.
<!-- This section is extremely unclear. First it makes a point to say Robert Rodi's "Rogue" (2004) contradicts information about Rogue's background. It implies that there was one version and "Rogue" 2004 was published and contradicted the earlier version. In the next sentences that follows it shows that is not the case. The following sentences states "X-Men Unlimited #4 (1994) contradicts Rogues background stated in "Uncanny X-Men #182" (1984), which contradicts information from "Uncanny X-Men #178 (1984) and "X-Men #93 (1999). Clearly, like most comic characters, there have been numerous retcons. Moving Rodi's "Rogue" (2004) to the end and stating the this is the latest retcon would change the incorrect implication that the paragraphs gives that his version is the beginning of the contradictions. -->

==Fictional character biography==

===Early life===
Her parents, Owen and Priscilla, marry early in their relationship and live in a back-to-nature [[hippie]] commune in Caldecott County, [[Mississippi]].<ref name="GoingRogue">''Rogue'' (vol. 3) #1–6 (September 2004 – February 2005). Marvel Comics</ref> Born as Anna Marie, she also enjoys the attentions of her Aunt Carrie, on her mother's side. Anna Marie is raised speaking [[Colloquialism|colloquial]] [[American English|English]] and [[French language in the United States|French]], common to the Mississippi [[bayou]] area.<ref>''X-Men/Alpha Flight'' #1 (December 1985). Marvel Comics</ref> The commune's failed attempt to use [[Native American mythologies|Native American]] mysticism to reach the "Far Banks" results in Priscilla's disappearance. Carrie takes over Anna's care, and in her grief at the loss of her sister, is a strict and authoritarian guardian. Anna Marie is a rebellious child<ref name="GoingRogue"/> and, at some point, the exact event or reasons still unclear, she runs away from home as a young teenager.

At some point, Rogue grows close to a boy named Cody Robbins. During their flirtation, Cody impulsively kisses her, at which point her latent mutant power to absorb the life energy and psyche of others with skin-to-skin contact emerges. Rogue is traumatized by the experience, and Cody is left in a permanent coma.<ref name="unlimited4">''X-Men Unlimited'' #4</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Sims |first=Chris |date=2020-05-04 |title=Rogue's Entire Backstory Explained - Looper |url=https://www.looper.com/206883/rogues-entire-backstory-explained/ |access-date=2022-10-10 |website=Looper.com |language=en-US}}</ref> Hence, Rogue wears body-concealing clothing that eliminates the possibility of accidental skin contact. She wishes she "did not have to cover up so much around folks" to protect them from her. She thinks her power is a curse.<ref>{{Cite web |last=shubham |date=2021-05-13 |title=Best Female Marvel Characters (The Handpicked List) |url=https://womenintheworld.org/female-marvel-characters/ |access-date=2022-10-10 |website=Women In The World |language=en-US}}</ref>

Not long after, she is approached by [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], who seeks her out on the advice of her precognitive partner [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sims |first=Chris |date=2020-05-04 |title=Rogue's Entire Backstory Explained - Looper |url=https://www.looper.com/206883/rogues-entire-backstory-explained/ |access-date=2022-10-10 |website=Looper.com |language=en-US}}</ref> Mystique ultimately takes Rogue in as a daughter.<ref name="unlimited4"/> In time, however, Mystique turns Rogue's loneliness, envy, bitterness, and despair into anger, thus recruiting her into the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===Brotherhood of Evil Mutants===
After Rogue's mutation emerges, [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] begins coaxing her into taking part in terrorist activities as a member of the Brotherhood of Mutants. Rogue initially wants only a normal life, but after she kisses a boy named Cody Robbins, unintentionally rendering him permanently unconscious with her power, she gives up on normality and begins taking part in Mystique's plans.<ref>Ann Nocenti's "Her First and Last", ''Classic X-Men'' #44 (February 1990). Marvel Comics</ref>

Rogue and Mystique associate briefly with a mutant named [[Blindspot (comics)|Blindspot]], whose power to erase the memories of others by touch somehow counteracts Rogue's mutation enough to allow them to make physical contact safely.<ref>{{cite comic| writer = [[Tony Bedard|Bedard, Tony]]| penciller = Moline, Karl| inker = Rick Magyar| editor=Moore, Stephanie|title = Rogue| volume = 3| issue = #10| date = June 2005| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> Blindspot and Rogue become good friends, but when Mystique decides to sever professional ties with Blindspot, Blindspot erases all memory of her from both Mystique and Rogue.<ref>{{cite comic| writer = [[Tony Bedard|Bedard, Tony]]| penciller = Donovan, Derec| editor=Moore, Stephanie|title = Rogue| volume = 3| issue = #11| date = July 2005| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

When Mystique debuts her Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, Destiny advises her to keep Rogue out of the action, advice which proves important when several members of the new Brotherhood are arrested and imprisoned. Mystique concocts a plan to free the other members of the Brotherhood by having Rogue absorb [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]]'s formidable powers.<ref name="debut">{{cite comic|Writer=[[Chris Claremont|Claremont, Chris]]|Penciller=[[Michael Golden (comics)|Golden, Michael]]|Title=Avengers Annual|Volume=1|Issue=#10|Date=November 1981|Publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> Rogue attacks Ms. Marvel in [[San Francisco]] on her front doorstep as she is returning home from grocery shopping.<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes'' (vol. 2) #11 (Fall 1992)</ref> Due to Ms. Marvel's formidable persona, Rogue's struggle to absorb her powers is prolonged, and the transfer of Ms. Marvel's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] and powers is permanent. Rogue then throws her off the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]. She battles the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] using her newly acquired powers.<ref name="debut"/>

Much later, while at [[the Pentagon]], she literally bumps into Carol Danvers, leading into a fight with [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] of the X-Men. Though Rogue proves more than a match for them, the four of them escape the Pentagon.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #158 (June 1982)</ref> Later, with Mystique and Destiny, Rogue attacks [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] and [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]], but is overpowered by Dazzler. Rogue develops a grudge against Dazzler for her controllable mutation and her relationship with Angel of the X-Men. Rogue is defeated by Dazzler a few times before Dazzler is publicly revealed to be a mutant and goes into hiding.<ref>''Dazzler'' #22–24, 28 (December 1982 – February 1983, September 1983). Marvel Comics</ref> Sometime after this, Rogue, Mystique and Destiny encounter the half-human, half-[[Dire Wraith]] entity called [[Hybrid (Jimmy Marks)|Hybrid]], with whom the three form an alliance against the [[Spaceknight]], [[Rom (comics)|Rom]]. However, when Rogue seizes an opportunity to use her power on him, she experiences both his loneliness and his nobility. This moment has a profound effect on her and serves as a crucial turning point in her life.<ref>''Rom'' #31–32 (June–July 1982). Marvel Comics</ref>

===X-Men===
The more Rogue uses her mutant power, the more her mind becomes filled with fragmentary psychic echoes of the people she absorbs.<ref name="UX236"/> The permanently absorbed Carol Danvers (Ms. Marvel) is a completely distinct, albeit dormant, personality in her head, and [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]] subtly exacerbates Rogue's psychological distress as a means of revenge against Mystique.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #170</ref> Desperate, Rogue turns to [[Professor Charles Xavier]] and the X-Men for help.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-01-03 |title=The tragic history between Carol Danvers and Rogue |url=https://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/the-tragic-history-between-carol-danvers-and-rogue |access-date=2022-10-10 |website=SYFY Official Site |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Harn |first=Darby |date=2022-10-06 |title=10 Best Villains Who Became Heroes In Marvel Comics |url=https://screenrant.com/best-villains-became-heroes-marvel-comics/ |access-date=2022-10-10 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref> The Professor is unable to do a psychic scan of her, due to the clashing human and [[Kree]] portions of her psyche, but nonetheless decides to not only welcome her into the school, but make her a probationary member of the X-Men. The X-Men threaten to leave the school should Rogue be accepted, even though none of the active members aside from Storm and Nightcrawler had even met Rogue before. However, Xavier is adamant and convinces the X-Men to stay.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men' 1983"/><ref>{{Cite web |last=Schedeen |first=Jesse |date=2015-07-14 |title=X-Men: Top 15 Rogue Moments |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/10-awesome-rogue-moments |access-date=2022-10-10 |website=IGN |language=en}}</ref>

The team meets up with Wolverine in [[Tokyo]], where his betrothed, [[Mariko Yashida]], greets Rogue with greater warmth than she had received from her own teammates.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #172 (August 1983). Marvel Comics</ref> This kindness later motivates Rogue to take a fatal laser blast in order to shield Mariko. Feeling indebted to her for saving his fiancée, Wolverine offers to transfer his healing power to her in order to save her life. She refuses, arguing that it might kill him, but this only serves to gain his trust, and Wolverine touches her to transfer his power anyway.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #173 (September 1983).

Marvel Comics</ref>

Overhearing a frantic message from Carol Danvers' former lover Michael Rossi causes the Danvers persona to become active. Under Danvers' control, Rogue invades a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[Helicarrier]] to rescue Rossi. Her natural persona fights to regain control, rapidly switching back and forth between the two personalities. Though Rogue ultimately regains control, the incident leaves her wracked with guilt over what she did to Carol Danvers.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #182 (June 1984). Marvel Comics</ref>

To defeat [[Adversary (comics)|Adversary]], the X-Men's physical and spiritual essences are used as fuel for Forge's energy star, which closes the doorway to Adversary's plane of existence. Roma, a prisoner of Adversary and guardian of the Multiverse, recreates the fallen X-Men from scratch, making her own minor alterations. Now, invisible to cameras and all forms of detection equipment, the X-Men resettle to Australia, defeating the Reavers and claiming their base in the Outback as a new base of operations.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #220–227. Marvel Comics</ref>

The X-Men use their new status to attack anti-mutant threats around the world. The island nation of Genosha's superpowered agents, the Press Gang, capture Rogue and Wolverine, and Wipeout fully cancels their abilities. Rogue is then sexually molested by her guards. She withdraws into her subconscious, and the Carol Danvers persona takes advantage of her distress by assuming control.<ref name="UX236">''Uncanny X-Men'' #236. Marvel Comics</ref>

The Danvers personality eventually grows so strong that Carol replaces Rogue's standard X-Men costume with Ms. Marvel's uniform during battle, as well as redecorating Rogue's room to her own tastes without her permission.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #244. Marvel Comics</ref>

===Return===
Sacrificing herself to stop [[Master Mold]], Rogue is pulled through the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]], where she is judged by other-dimensional forces with the promise of a "new life."<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #246</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=2019-07-08 |title=X-Men: 10 Most Important Rogue Stories Of All Time |language=en-US |work=CBR |url=https://www.cbr.com/x-men-important-rogue-stories/ |access-date=2022-10-10}}</ref> Rogue is purged of the remaining portions of Carol Danvers's personality, as well as Carol's powers, and teleported back to the X-Men's Outback base. She finds it has been taken over by the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]] in her absence, and the now-physically separate Danvers persona attacks her. Rogue flees, absorbing the powers of the mutant [[Gateway (comics)|Gateway]] in order to teleport herself to safety. She ends up in the [[Savage Land]], and spends the ensuing days learning how to survive in the inhospitable land. She is eventually attacked again by Danvers, who is now under the mental enslavement of [[Shadow King]]. There is not enough life force between the two to sustain both Rogue and Danvers physically as a result of the separation, and Rogue is unwilling to kill Danvers. With Danvers on the verge of draining Rogue's life completely, [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] intervenes and kills the Ms. Marvel persona.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #269 (October 1990).

Rogue and Magneto join forces with [[Ka-Zar (Kevin Plunder)|Ka-zar]] and [[Nick Fury]] to battle [[Zaladane]], who is trying to conquer the Savage Land.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #274 (March 1991). Marvel Comics</ref> Once Zaladane is defeated and helpless, Magneto kills her, against Rogue and Fury's protests, parting ways with the X-Men's ideals and methods before flying away.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #275 (April 1991)</ref> Rogue then flies to Muir Island to rejoin the rest of the X-Men, the powers she absorbed from Ms. Marvel now returned.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #278 (July 1991). Marvel Comics</ref>

The X-Men later divide into two teams to make better use of their large number of active members; Rogue is assigned to the Blue Team, under the leadership of [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and alongside new X-Man [[Gambit (Marvel Comics)|Gambit]]. Upon his arrival, Gambit flirts with each of the female members of the team; however, Rogue immediately catches his eye, and he makes no secret of his romantic desire for her.<ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #3–4. Marvel Comics</ref> The development of Rogue and Gambit's relationship is slow and rocky, partly as a result of her inability to control her powers and partly as a result of long-term issues with previous relationships on Gambit's part.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

As an act of penance, Rogue continues to visit Cody Robbins at a hospice run by a religious order. He is later abducted by assassins sent by Gambit's ex-wife, [[Bella Donna Boudreaux]], as part of a revenge plot against Rogue. Cody is used as a pawn in the ensuing fight between Rogue and [[Candra (comics)|Candra]] and eventually dies. Through a spiritual healer of Bella Donna, Tante Mattie, Rogue is able to make amends with Cody's spirit. He holds no hard feelings against her, knowing what happened was an accident, and urges her to move on.<ref>''Rogue'' #1–4 (January–April 1995). Marvel Comics</ref>

It is eventually revealed that Mystique had two sons: the now-deceased anti-mutant politician [[Graydon Creed]] and Rogue's long-time teammate, [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]].<ref>''X-Men Unlimited'' #4. Marvel Comics</ref> Rogue and Nightcrawler consider themselves to be siblings, although the revelation has not particularly altered their friendship.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Following the supposed "death" of Cyclops, the X-Men team undergoes major changes, among them Rogue being made the team's new field commander. Her even temper and years of X-Men service make her an ideal leader and she continues to lead the team until Storm returns.<ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #103. Marvel Comics</ref>

When the Galactic Council transforms Earth into a maximum-security penal colony for hundreds of extraterrestrial criminals, Rogue absorbs the attributes of Z'Cann; a mutant, telepathic [[Skrull]] who had joined [[Skrull#Known Skrulls|Cadre K]], Xavier's Skrull equivalent to the X-Men. Z'Cann purposely touches Rogue to activate her mutant abilities, as the two evade bounty hunters. Z'Cann uses her telepathy to amplify Rogue's capacity to assimilate memories, causing her powers to mutate.<ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #107 (December 2000). Marvel Comics</ref> Henceforth, Rogue is able to "recall" previously absorbed powers,{{Issue|date=July 2011}} but also finds it increasingly difficult to control which powers manifest and when, typically possessing Wolverine's healing factor and claws, Cyclops' optic blasts, and her natural strength.

===X-Treme X-Men team===
Rogue is part of the [[X-Treme X-Men]] team led by [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]]. The team's first mission is in search of [[Destiny (Irene Adler)#The Books of Truth|Destiny's diaries]] (which prophesy future events). During an invasion of [[Khan (comics)|Khan]] (an alien conqueror from another dimension) of the island nation of [[Madripoor]], Rogue requests that [[Sage (comics)|Sage]] use her power of jump-starting abilities to evolve her to a point where she can control all of the various powers that she has ever absorbed. Sage agrees, and Rogue becomes a one-woman army, able to use the powers of anyone she absorbed in the past all at once.<ref>''X-Treme X-Men'' #13 (July 2002). Marvel Comics</ref>

During Khan's invasion, Rogue is also confronted by [[Vargas (comics)|Vargas]] who is said to be "a new species altogether". Vargas foresees himself being killed by Rogue in [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]]'s diaries and, despite his belief in the prophecies, attempts to stop this occurrence from happening. Thus, in the midst of the invasion battle, Vargas ambushes Rogue as she is trying to rescue Gambit (see ''[[X-Treme X-Men]]''), spearing both Rogue and Gambit with his blade before escaping. Rogue survives due to possessing both Wolverine and the [[Hulk]]'s powers. Returning to the city shortly after the battle to recover his sword, Vargas is surprised in turn by Rogue dressed in Psylocke's costume (Vargas having killed [[Betsy Braddock|Psylocke]] earlier for sport). After a lengthy battle, Rogue fulfills "her destiny" by seemingly finishing Vargas off with his own weapon. Returning to Gambit, Rogue, with the help of [[Jean Grey]], forces him from near death in the astral plane.<ref>''X-Treme X-Men'' #17 (October 2002). Marvel Comics</ref>

Following the repulsion of the invasion, Rogue realizes that Destiny's prophecies are only possibilities and that trying to follow them is more dangerous than ignoring them. She also learns that she inherited a mansion in New Orleans from Destiny, as well as a sizable fortune, and the X-Treme X-Men team retire there to recuperate. Rogue soon leaves the team with Gambit. After emerging powerless from their ordeals, the two want to explore their relationship further.<ref>''X-Treme X-Men'' #19 (December 2002). Marvel Comics</ref>

After life on the road, the couple ends up living in a beach house in Valle Soleada, a town where mutants and humans coexist peacefully. She works as a motorcycle mechanic, while Gambit is often "on the road" (implying he is thieving or on missions with Storm). She subsequently receives a visit from [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] and Sage and, after a series of events involving an investigation into the murder of a human girl's family, Rogue and Gambit sign up with Bishop and Sage to help Storm's X-Treme X-Men stop Sage's enemy and former boss Elias Bogan. After the battle, Rogue asks Sage to restore Gambit's abilities, which she does. Gambit asks if the same can be done for Rogue, but it is never revisited after Rogue quickly dismisses his comment.<ref name="X-Treme X-Men' 2004">''X-Treme X-Men'' #46 (June 2004).

===Back to the X-Men===
Rogue and Gambit return to the X-Men as part of Marvel's [[X-Men ReLoad|ReLoad]]. Over time, Rogue's own abilities return, although exactly how and when is never revealed or discussed. However, she no longer possesses the abilities she absorbed from Ms. Marvel. Rogue and Gambit are both put on [[Havok (comics)|Havok]]'s team and participated in various missions.<ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #157 (July 2004). Marvel Comics</ref>

As described in her own miniseries, Rogue then travels down south to save a young mutant girl from her powers. While there, she meets Campbell St. Ange, a young man immune to Rogue's lethal touch. Also while there, Rogue forcibly absorbs knowledge from her Aunt Carrie that explains that Rogue's mother traveled to the Far Banks, a dream-realm, to stop her father from getting there. Rogue encounters the incorporeal spirit of her mother therein and absorbs her memories. After the reunion, her mother's trapped spirit can finally move on. Rogue subsequently goes back to her Aunt Carrie and makes amends with her.<ref>''Rogue'' (vol. 3) #6 (February 2005). Marvel Comics</ref>

Rogue then returns to the X-Men and confronts the monstrous Golgotha (large space creatures with telepathic abilities that induce insanity in some by bringing out and, to some extent, amplifying people's emotions). As the result of Golgotha influence, Rogue and Gambit get into a fight about the reality of their relationship with Rogue's uncontrollable powers. He claims if they were always able to touch, Rogue would have been "just another one-night stand," that they would have parted much sooner, before leaving. Amplified under the influence of Golgotha, Wolverine's hidden emotions come out, revealing to Rogue he desires her in a romantic/sexual way and, in fact, always had. He and Rogue passionately kiss, until both her power affect him, and [[Emma Frost]] telepathically interrupts.<ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #169 (June 2005). Marvel Comics</ref>

While on a trip to Japan to investigate an incriminating photo of her and [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] engaged in criminal activities, Rogue and Sunfire learn that Rogue's former friend and Brotherhood teammate, [[Blindspot (comics)|Blindspot]], erased their memories of the event. In this storyline, Rogue accidentally and permanently absorbs Sunfire's fire abilities (who lost his legs to [[Lady Deathstrike]] and does not want to live).<ref>''Rogue'' (vol. 3) #11 (July 2005). Marvel Comics</ref>

Later, back at the X-Mansion, Emma Frost tries to help Rogue and Gambit by providing telepathic relationship counseling, but their relationship continues to be problematic. Rogue then discovers Gambit is being seduced by the student called Foxx. It is later revealed, however, that [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], displeased with Rogue's choice of lovers, infiltrated the Xavier Institute by shapeshifting into Foxx and joined Gambit's squad in an attempt to ruin his relationship with Rogue. After Gambit resists her charms, Mystique reverts to her true form and makes an offer to Gambit; she transforms into Rogue and offers Gambit a Rogue with whom he can have a physical relationship. Gambit later denies to having slept with Mystique.<ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #174 (October 2005). Marvel Comics.</ref> Rogue eventually discovers her foster mother's presence in the school and her attempts to seduce Gambit, becoming furious with both parties. Because Gambit fails to tell Rogue of Mystique's presence in the institute, their relationship develops the exact rift Mystique is hoping for, allowing her to set up her daughter with her accomplice, [[Pulse (Augustus)|Pulse]]. After being discovered, Mystique asks the X-Men for permission to stay at the mansion. The X-Men vote, and Mystique is allowed to be a [[Probation (workplace)|probationary]] member, a decision with which neither Rogue nor Gambit are happy.<ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #174 (October 2005). Marvel Comics</ref>

===Blood of Apocalypse===
In the events that followed [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], the mutant [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] is reawakened. Gambit, seeking redemption from Rogue and his fellow X-Men, volunteers to be transformed into Apocalypse's [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|horseman]] Death. Gambit believes he can control whatever Apocalypse will do to him, in hopes of gaining more power to protect Rogue and the X-Men from the villain.<ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #184 "Epilogue: Riddle of the Sphinx"</ref> However, having been brainwashed, Gambit tries to kill Rogue (the only part of Gambit's past life that remains). After Apocalypse's defeat, Sunfire (who is granted new legs and transformed into the horseman Famine) and Gambit leaves the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #187. Marvel Comics</ref>

===Endangered Species: Rogue's X-Men===
As Professor Xavier goes into space with [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] and several other X-Men to pursue the villain [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]], Cyclops gives Rogue the authority to form her own team, complimenting her inspired improvisation in battle situations. She is hesitant at first, because of Gambit's recent disappearance with Sunfire, but accepts the position, saying that when he comes back, she will still be at the school. She chooses [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], [[Lady Mastermind]], [[Karima Shapandar]] (Omega Sentinel), and [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], a line-up with which Cyclops does not agree.<ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #192 (December 2006). Marvel Comics</ref>

Mystique seemingly tries to repair her relationship with Rogue, but is rebuffed.{{issue|date=July 2021}} Rogue's team defeats the group known as the [[Children of the Vault]].{{issue|date=July 2021}} Afterward, Rogue declares that her team will leave the [[X-Mansion]].{{issue|date=July 2021}}

Rogue is hospitalized after a battle with Pandemic. [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], desiring Rogue's help in defeating the Hecatomb, forces her awake. Pandemic infects Rogue with a virus, Strain 88, altering her powers by amplifying them into an instantaneous death-touch. In defeating Hecatomb, Rogue absorbs psyches of eight billion entities that were stored inside it.<ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #199 (July 2007). Marvel Comics</ref>

The team moves to Rogue's hometown of Caldecott for Rogue to recover. As Cyclops and Emma Frost arrive to help Rogue cope with the immensity of the voices in her mind. [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] arrive, seeking Destiny's diaries. As part of the attack, it is revealed that Mystique is working with the Marauders and for [[Mister Sinister]]. Mystique shoots Rogue and takes her back to Mister Sinister's base, who only keeps Rogue alive because she holds all the information of Destiny's diaries within her mind.<ref name="XMen200Vol2">''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #200 (August 2007). Marvel Comics</ref> Gambit, who joined the Marauders and Mister Sinister again, is protective of Rogue, accusing Mystique of being too careless in how she captured her. Standing over Rogue, trying to get her to wake up (after she fell into a trance, overcome by the minds she absorbed), Gambit expresses his apologies for what he did before rejoining Sinister. While in her coma-like state, Rogue has dream-like flashes of memories, seeing her relationship with Gambit, and the millions of minds she absorbed, before briefly waking up and recognizing Gambit. She tells him she had a nightmare, before spouting incoherent words and mysterious coordinates.<ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #204 (December 2007). Marvel Comics</ref>

===Messiah Complex===
{{Main|X-Men: Messiah Complex}}
The X-Men attacks the Marauders' Antarctic base in order to rescue Rogue and the mysterious mutant baby who is at the center of Messiah Complex. However, the baby eventually takes precedence and the X-Men do not recover (or even see) Rogue.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Mister Sinister, now in possession of the mutant baby, relocates the Marauders to Muir Island. While standing by Rogue's bedside, Mystique is visited by Mister Sinister, who tells her that there will be no cure for Rogue and she will eventually die. Without warning, Mystique ambushes Sinister and shoves his face onto Rogue's. The instant contact seemingly kills Sinister.<ref>''[[New X-Men (2004 series)|New X-Men]]'' (vol. 2) #46. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Mystique, in keeping with the words of Destiny's diaries, places the baby's face in direct contact with Rogue's, with the understanding that Rogue will awaken from her comatose state. The baby is not affected by Rogue, who awakens shortly after. Realizing what Mystique did at the risk of killing the baby, Rogue says she is tired of people's lives being destroyed by Mystique and grabs Mystique's face barehanded, fully absorbing her powers and consciousness and incapacitating her. However, she immediately regrets her action after realizing that the baby deleted all the consciousnesses she had previously absorbed, along with Strain 88, so that now Mystique is the only one in her head. She says she needs to be alone and tells Gambit not to follow her.<ref name="XMen207Vol2"/>

===Being cured===
Rogue takes some time out from the X-Men and travels around the Australian Outback on a motorcycle.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #210 (June 2008). Marvel Comics</ref> She returns to the X-Men's former headquarters in Maynards Plains, Australia. Once there, she has a conversation with Mystique (a part of Rogue's psyche), telling her that no one else can help her with her powers and that it was down to her to figure out how to control them.

One day, a woman appears in town, claiming to be an [[anthropologist]] from [[Melbourne University]]. Rogue made it clear she could stay as long as she wants, but to keep out of her way. The anthropologist approached Rogue with questions about some of the items she found in the ghost town. Rogue said she does not know anything about these and to leave her alone. The anthropologist follows Rogue and eventually confesses that she has a different identity. The anthropologist was then targeted by a low flying [[Shi'ar]] spaceship and revealed that she was actually [[Danger Room#Sentience|Danger]] in disguise. She informs Rogue she planned to get revenge on Professor Xavier by using her as a conduit.<ref name="XMen220Vol2"/> Danger created an amalgamation of several past events in the X-Men's history prominently involving Rogue in the town using her hard light capabilities. As Professor Xavier and Gambit searched for her, Rogue evaded old versions of the X-Men and the Marauders that were part of Danger's creation. She was finally cornered by the Marauders and refused to let Mystique's psyche take control of Rogue's body and save her as the fake Marauder [[Scalphunter (Marvel Comics)|Scalphunter]] shot at her. Mystique then forcibly took over Rogue's body to save her and fought off the Marauders, then returned control of Rogue's body to her.<ref name="XMen221Vol2"/>

Rogue then wandered to the fake [[Tokyo Tower]] and tried to find the institute, deducing that the projections around her were changing at 10-minute intervals, altering the environment around her. However, Rogue did not get far as she ended up in Antarctica, witnessing the moment she abandoned Gambit after his trial. She regretted her decisions there, telling Mystique that she really had not moved on. It was at that point that Cody Robbins appeared before Rogue, repeating his greeting from the night her powers manifested. Rogue just stared at him in shock.<ref name="XMen222Vol2"/>

Eventually, the Professor, Gambit, and a group of Shi'ar pirates managed to shut down Danger. The pirates, in turn, attacked the Professor, as their intent was to kidnap him and Danger for bounty. In the meantime, Rogue enters the scene and attacks the pirates, but is defeated. However, the Professor reactivates Danger and she defeats the pirates in turn. After this, it was revealed that Rogue's powers never truly developed past their initial "nascent" stage, which was the reason why her powers never functioned properly. The Professor, now aware of this fact, used his telepathy to tear down the mental walls that kept Rogue's powers from developing (the walls were created as a side effect every time she absorbed other people, starting with Cody and even more so with Ms. Marvel) and removed the persistent mental echo of Mystique. Finally, Rogue kissed Gambit, with no ill side effect, revealing that she was finally in control of her absorption power.<ref name="X-Men: Legacy #224">''X-Men: Legacy'' #224 (July 2009). Marvel Comics</ref>

===Utopia===
Rogue, Gambit, and Danger decide to go to San Francisco in order to regroup with the other X-Men. On their way there they are intercepted by [[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]], who teleports them into the city, which is in a state of chaos due to the anti-mutant and pro-mutant movements. Cyclops admonishes Rogue for her disappearance and sends all three out in order to locate several missing students and bring them home. During their mission, Rogue faces off against the new [[Karla Sofen|Ms. Marvel]]; finding that she cannot touch her opponent, Rogue resorts to a trick and flees the site.<ref>''X-Men Legacy'' #226</ref>

Later on she joins Gambit, who has been injured by [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]], along with Danger. Ares does not take her seriously and dismisses her both as an opponent and her attempts to calm things down. This results in Rogue grabbing Ares and absorbing his powers. Ares is dismissive of her attempt and claims that she cannot absorb him, a boast that proves wrong as she weakens him enough for Gambit to blast him, leaving him bloody and stunned. Having for the moment absorbed some of Ares' power, she easily dispatches a small group of H.A.M.M.E.R. agents with superhuman strength and proceeds to steal their tank, along with Gambit and Danger, in order to find the rest of the students.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #226 (September 2009). Marvel Comics</ref>

Rogue finds [[Trance (comics)|Trance]] as her powers are flaring out of control, creating powerful and uncontrollable bio-electric blasts. Rogue tries to help calm Trance and help her gain control when Ms. Marvel appears to fight against Rogue. After taking out Gambit and Danger, Rogue and Ms. Marvel fight; Rogue is losing until Trance regains control and jumps in to help Rogue. Trance learns that her astral form is able to punch Ms. Marvel when they are both intangible. After Gambit stuns Ms. Marvel, they teleport back to base, where Trance receives medical attention.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #227 (October 2009). Marvel Comics</ref>

===Nation-X===
As Utopia has become a safe haven for mutants, the entire population were on high alert following an attack on the X-Men by [[Emplate]], who feeds on mutant bone marrow for sustenance. The X-Men instruct everyone to stay close to each other and report anything out of the ordinary. [[Bling (comics)|Bling]] goes to check out an old amphitheatre on her own when Emplate captures her to use as a food source.{{issue|date=March 2015}}

Unable to enter Emplate's cross-dimensional base, Rogue absorbs Trance's astral projection ability to enter the dimension and save Bling. As she investigates his lighthouse home for clues to Bling's whereabouts, Rogue was attacked by psychoplasmic ghosts. After fighting them off, she rescues Bling from Emplate.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #228–230 (November 2009 – January 2010). Marvel Comics</ref>

Rogue also protects the students during an attack by a [[Predator X (comics)|Predator X]] herd by absorbing the powers of multiple students.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men 517">''Uncanny X-Men'' #517 (January 2010). Marvel Comics</ref>

===Necrosha===
In an attempt to finally achieve godhood, [[Selene (comics)|Selene]], along with her servant [[Eli Bard]], resurrected many of the X-Men's greatest deceased allies and villains under her control. Among the resurrected is Rogue's foster mother, Destiny, who attempts to contact Rogue but instead contacts [[Blindfold (comics)|Blindfold]].<ref>''X-Necrosha'' #1 (December 2009). Marvel Comics</ref> However, [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|Proteus]] had possessed Destiny when she came back. When she makes contact, he leaves her to possess the body of Blindfold, so he can trick her into convincing a team of X-Men to go to Muir Island, where he hopes to kill them.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #231 (February 2010). Marvel Comics</ref> Eventually, Rogue and a team of X-Men manage to defeat Proteus and Rogue tearfully says good-bye to her foster mother as Destiny once more dies.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #233 (April 2010). Marvel Comics</ref>

===Post-Siege===
Following the ''[[Siege (comics)|Siege of Asgard]]'', Rogue was present at the funeral of Robert Reynolds, [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|the Sentry]]. She stated that Reynolds was immune to the ill effects of her power and that, in a time in her past when she could touch no one else, she had at least one intimate encounter with him.<ref>''Sentry: Fallen Sun'' (July 2010). Marvel Comics.</ref> However, between two episodes of psychic blocks that caused Reynolds to completely forget his life as the Sentry, when he regained those memories for a few days, he contacted Charles Xavier telepathically and did not recognize Rogue when he "saw" her through that telepathic bond.{{issue|date=November 2013}}

===Second Coming===
During the event in which Cable and [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope]] return to the present timeline, Rogue is able to sense Hope's presence, like Destiny prophesied, although neither she nor Emma Frost can explain it. After a short confrontation with some of [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]]'s men, the X-Men and Cable decide for a diversionary tactic. Cable, along with some of the X-Men, stays behind (since it was him they were tracking), while Rogue, Nightcrawler, and Hope leave so that their enemies do not capture Hope. To that end, Rogue absorbs the power sets of Colossus, Wolverine, [[X-23]], the Archangel, and Psylocke.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #235 (June 2010). Marvel Comics.</ref>

For a while their tactic works, leaving Cable, along with some of the X-Men, to fend off Bastion's troops. In the meantime, Kurt, along with Rogue and Hope, teleports across the United States towards Utopia. This, however, exerts him to such a degree that he has to rest for a moment; they are soon confronted by Bastion himself. Seeing no alternative, Rogue attacks him, hoping to buy enough time for Kurt and Hope to flee, but Bastion is able to hit Kurt with an energy blast that knocks him out. Channeling Colossus's strength, further enhancing it with Betsy's telekinesis and using the individual claw sets of Logan and X-23 along with their healing factors, Rogue is able to inflict massive damage to Bastion. However, Bastion is able to repair himself and overpower Rogue with an energy discharge which briefly incapacitates her. Unable to do anything, she watches with horror as Bastion fatally impales Kurt with his arm.<ref name="X-Force 26">''X-Force'' (vol. 3) #26 (June 2010). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Rogue is appointed Hope's protector while on Utopia and allows her to participate in the final battle, where Hope eventually destroys Bastion. Her actions and choices put Hope in danger and ultimately results in Cyclops suspending Rogue from active duty. She, however, remain as Hope's protector and accompanies her to Alaska in search of her real family.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men 526">''Uncanny X-Men'' #526 (September 2010). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Collision===
Rogue, along with Magneto, Alani Ryan, and [[Anole (comics)|Anole]], accompany [[Indra (comics)|Indra]] to India: Indra because his wealthy parents informed him of his brother being ill; Magneto because he wanted to investigate strange anomalies in electromagnetic fields over Mumbai. They are attacked by giant Servidores who are chasing Luz,<ref>''X-Men Legacy'' #238</ref> a young woman who claims to be a mutant, but later turns out to be from Quitado, an alien city populated by lab-created superhumans.<ref>''X-Men Legacy'' #239</ref> Her "family", the [[Children of the Vault]], tracks her to Indra's house where she, Rogue, and Magneto are defeated and taken prisoner. Rogue is sentenced for execution, as the city's occupants have a particular anger towards her because she had fought against them and killed many of them when they tried to wipe out all inhabitants of Earth, whom they consider as pests. In the meantime, Luz's trick results in the alien city crash landing in Mumbai, which gives Rogue time to knock out her would-have-been executioner.<ref>''X-Men Legacy'' #240</ref>

===Post "Age of X"===
After the events of the "[[Age of X]]" storyline, Rogue decides not to wipe her memories. Gambit admits the extent of his feelings for her, but is also frustrated by her indecisiveness. He tells her that it is better they are apart until she decides to be with him for good and that he would be waiting for her when she is ready.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #248</ref> She becomes torn between her feelings for Gambit and Magneto. After Rogue confronts Magneto about his past, she spends a night with him, promising nothing else.<ref name="X-Men: Legacy 248">''X-Men: Legacy'' #248 (July 2011). Marvel Comics</ref> Afterwards, Rogue joins Professor X, Frenzy, Legion, Magneto, and Gambit on a mission to capture several of Legion's personalities that escaped after Age of X. The final battle with Legion's personality Styx results in Rogue temporarily absorbing many of Legion's powers, which led her to finding the location of Havok, Polaris, and Marvel Girl; the mutants that were left in space after the X-Men's mission to stop Vulcan.<ref name="X-Men: Legacy 253">''X-Men: Legacy'' #253 (October 2011).

After the events of "[[X-Men: Schism|Schism]]", Rogue chooses to be on Wolverine's team, noting to Cyclops that he has reached a point where his previous willingness to question his decisions has been replaced by an inability to accept when he might be wrong. She returns to Westchester, New York with Wolverine's team to start the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning.<ref>''X-Men: ReGenesis'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref>

===Avengers vs. X-Men===
Although Rogue was initially neutral in the [[Avengers vs. X-Men|war between the Avengers and the X-Men]], when the Jean Grey School was surrounded by the [[She-Hulk]], the [[Moon Knight]], and the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] to stop other X-Men from joining Cyclops' team, Rogue was forced into action when some students attacked the She-Hulk,<ref>{{cite comic |writer=Gage, Christos |penciller=Sandoval, Rafa |inker=Tarragona, Jordi |colorist=Rosenberg, Rachelle |story= |title=X-Men: Legacy |volume=1 |issue=#266 |date=May 2012 |publisher=Marvel Comics |id=}}</ref> declaring her allegiance to Cyclops after [[Iron Man]] sent a remote-controlled armor to attack the school.<ref>{{cite comic |writer=Gage, Christos |penciller=Sandoval, Rafa |inker=Tarragona, Jordi |colorist=Rosenberg, Rachelle |story= |title=X-Men: Legacy |volume=1 |issue=#267 |date=May 2012 |publisher=Marvel Comics |id=}}</ref> However, Rogue swiftly changed sides again when she witnessed [[Magik (Illyana Rasputina)|Magik]] — now empowered by one-fifth of the Phoenix Force — imprison Ms. Marvel in a portion of Limbo that she had brought to Earth.<ref>{{cite comic |writer=Gage, Christos |penciller=Baldeon, David |inker=Tarragona, Jordi |colorist=Reber, Brian |story= |title=X-Men: Legacy |volume=1 |issue=#268 |date=June 2012 |publisher=Marvel Comics |id=}}</ref> Magik briefly banished Rogue to another world for her defiance,<ref>{{cite comic |writer=Gage, Christos |penciller=Baldeon, David |inker=Tarragona, Jordi |colorist=Reber, Brian |story= |title=X-Men: Legacy |volume=1 |issue=#270 |date=July 2012 |publisher=Marvel Comics |id=}}</ref> but Rogue was able to return home after helping to resolve a conflict between two alien races, having learned that the leaders of both sides were prolonging the war to keep their populations down to a manageable level.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #271-273</ref> Having returned to Earth, Rogue served as the X-Men's representative when appealing to the Avengers for asylum from the increasingly dictatorial Cyclops.<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #11.

===Uncanny Avengers===
Rogue attends Xavier's funeral alongside Wolverine. Later, after seeing the [[Scarlet Witch]] placing flowers on Xavier's grave, Rogue confronts her and orders her to leave, blaming her for his death; the two begin a verbal conflict that results in Rogue punching her in the face, though the Scarlet Witch refuses to fight back. Rogue intends to absorb her powers, but it fails. They are then attacked by [[S-Men|five mysterious assailants]]. During this conflict, the Scarlet Witch is impaled while defending Rogue, and the two are both seemingly defeated.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Remender|first=Rick|author2=Cassaday, John |title=Uncanny Avengers|issue=#1}}</ref>

It is later revealed that the instigator behind the attack on Rogue and the Scarlet Witch was the [[Red Skull]], who has since fused his and Xavier's brains to give him access to his tremendous mental powers.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Austin |first=Michael |date=2019-07-08 |title=X-Men: 10 Most Important Rogue Stories Of All Time |url=https://www.cbr.com/x-men-important-rogue-stories/ |access-date=2022-10-10 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> Despite the Skull's attempts to control them, he is eventually defeated by the 'Avengers Unity' team — including [[Captain America]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], Wolverine and Havok — but manages to escape.{{issue|date=December 2013}} In the aftermath, Rogue accepts membership of the team, seeing it as the best way to continue Xavier's dream, but notes that she will still not forgive the Scarlet Witch for her actions.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #4.

The team makes their debut as the Avengers Unity Squad (which also contains [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]], the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], and [[Wonder Man]] as the team's latest recruits) during a press conference that debuts them. The press conference is then crashed by a resurrected [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]], who attacks the Avengers Unity Squad while claiming that he is now unable to die.

===''X-Men'' (vol. 4)===
In 2013, Marvel revealed a new comic book simply named ''X-Men''. Written by [[Brian Wood (comics)|Brian Wood]], ''X-Men'' features an all-female cast including [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]], Rogue, [[Kitty Pryde]], [[Rachel Summers|Rachel Grey]], and [[Betsy Braddock|Psylocke]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Esposito|first=Joey|title=Marvel Debuts All-Female X-Men|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2013/01/14/marvel-debuts-all-female-x-men|website=IGN|date=14 January 2013 }}</ref> Rogue was removed from this series' cast after the ''[[Battle of the Atom]]'' crossover, to avoid contradicting her death in ''[[Uncanny Avengers]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===AXIS and return to the Uncanny Avengers===
After her resurrection, Rogue took part in AXIS with the X-Men, her powers allowing her to sense the aspect of Professor X that remained within the Red Skull.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #25</ref> During this time, the AUD was disbanded when various heroes underwent a moral inversion due to a spell cast by [[Doctor Doom]] and the Scarlet Witch to stop the telepathic Red Skull. In the aftermath, the Unity Division was reformed, with Rogue as leader of the team.<ref>''Avengers/X-Men: AXIS'' #9</ref><ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' (vol. 2) #1</ref>

===All-New, All-Different Marvel===
Following the Incursions, Rogue remains as the field leader of the Avengers Unity Squad, although she accepts Steve Rogers' official oversight and recommendations for membership, such as [[Deadpool]]. She is also depicted as suffering side-effects from the mass terrigenesis, requiring regular injections to stop herself from becoming ill or dying.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' (vol. 3) #1</ref> When various Avengers are brainwashed into civilian lives in the community of Pleasant Hill – a S.H.I.E.L.D. project to 'reprogram' supervillains into regular civilians using fragments of a [[Cosmic Cube]] that has since gained sentience – Rogue's new identity of Claire sees through the deception thanks to telepathic training provided by Professor X, allowing her mind to plant various clues that lead her to the rest of the team.<ref name="UncanAven3#8">''Uncanny Avengers'' (vol. 3) #8</ref> The same training helps her to resist telepathic attacks by the Red Skull who is keen to use her powers.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' (vol. 3) #18</ref> Later on, the Red Skull attempts to mount a new attack on the team and Rogue succumbs, but Deadpool is able to resist the telepathic attack long enough to get Magneto's old helmet on Rogue so that she can resist the Skull's telepathy.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' (vol. 3) #21</ref> Rogue subsequently takes the Skull to a new facility where [[Beast (Marvel Comics)|Beast]] is able to extract the uniquely Xavier elements from the Skull's brain, depriving him of Xavier's telepathy.

Absorbing Deadpool results in the return of [[Wonder Man]] (whom she had previously absorbed).<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' (vol. 3) #22</ref> She seems to have at least partially gained control of her powers, as seen when she touches Johnny Storm and is held by Wonder Man.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' (vol. 3) #28</ref><ref>''Avengers'' #686</ref> She fights against the HYDRA forces in Washington D.C. during the dictatorship of HYDRA Captain America.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #8</ref> She resumes her relationship with Johnny Storm<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' (vol. 3) #30</ref> and avenges his apparent death by killing [[Corvus Glaive]].<ref>''Avengers'' #680</ref>

===Return to X-Men===
Rogue returns to the Xavier Institute for Mutant Outreach and Education in New York after the incarceration of [[Kitty Pryde]] and forms a secondary team with the [[Iceman (Marvel Comics)|Iceman]], [[Armor (comics)|Armor]], [[Ink (comics)|Ink]], [[Magma (comics)|Magma]], and [[Magik (Illyana Rasputin)|Magik]].<ref>''X-Men: Gold'' #24</ref> Later, [[Kitty Pryde]] sends her on an undercover mission with her ex-boyfriend [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] to the island of Paraiso. Their mission, as an estranged couple requiring relationship therapy, was to investigate the disappearance of mutants.<ref>''Rogue & Gambit'' #1 (2018)</ref> This results not only in them confronting their emotions and relationship challenges, but also finding that their memories and powers (as well as those of the missing mutants) are drained into their clones by a mutant called Lavish. Although they are severely weak, they fight against Lavish and the clones, restoring their memories and powers.<ref>''Rogue & Gambit'' #1-5 (2018)</ref> The couple decide to reunite and Rogue thanks Kitty for having sent them on the mission.<ref>''X-Men: The Wedding Special'' (2018)</ref> A conversation with [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] spurs Gambit into proposing to her at Kitty and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]' cancelled wedding and the couple decide to take advantage of all their friends being present.

While in space, their honeymoon is interrupted when they receive a message from Kitty Pryde about a secret package that they must find; however, the unknown package involves the Shi'ar Empire and several others are after it as well.<ref>''Mr. and Mrs. X'' #1 (July 2018)</ref><ref>''Mr. and Mrs. X'' #2 (August 2018)</ref> They soon discover that the package is actually Xandra, who is the bio-engineered daughter of Xavier and Lilandra who can take any form at will.<ref>''Mr. and Mrs. X'' #3 (September 2018)</ref> The newlyweds are soon caught by the Shi'ar but are able to free themselves; with the help of Cerise and the Starjammers, they escape. Having read Rogue's mind, Xandra offers to fix her abilities so she can touch anyone; however, Rogue refuses; when Gambit questions her, she explains that the last time it happened, she never learned to control it herself. The ground is interrupted by the Imperial Guard and by Deathbird and a fight ensues.<ref>''Mr. and Mrs. X'' #4 (October 2018)</ref> Realizing they are losing the fight, Xandra uses her abilities to make everyone think she and Rogue were killed; after the Imperial Guard and Deathbird leave, they return, only to have Rogue's ability become uncontrollable, as she can now absorb memories without touching anyone. Xandra explains that her powers have evolved, Rogue will have to learn to control it on her own; Gambit and Rogue return to Earth.<ref name="Mrs. X 2018">''Mr. and Mrs. X'' #5 (November 2018)</ref>

During the holiday season, Gambit and Rogue are pulled into the Mojoverse.<ref>''Mr. and Mrs. X'' #6 (December 2018)</ref> They are, at first, unaware of what is going on due to their minds being wiped and living in a Noir setting until Rogue's ability becomes unstable, killing Remy in the process,<ref>''Mr. and Mrs. X'' #7 (January 2019)</ref> forcing [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]] to constantly reset their lives to Fantasy, Western, Horror, Romance, Sci-Fi and Comedy. During a reality talk show, Gambit walks off and into a bar, where he meets a mysterious brunette who turns out to be [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]]. She restores his memory and makes Gambit an offer that if he steals something for her, she will help Rogue with her powers and help them escape. Spiral meets Rogue in her mind and explains to her that, until she became self-aware of what her abilities should be doing, she was subconsciously blocking control over her powers.<ref name="ReferenceA">''Mr. and Mrs. X'' #8 (February 2019)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
{{Primary sources|section|date=March 2015}}
{{In-universe|section|date=March 2015}}
Due to the nature of her unique mutant powers, Rogue has had several different abilities over the decades.

===Mutant powers===
Rogue possesses the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] ability to absorb the psyche and abilities of another human being (or members of some sapient alien races) through skin contact.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Smith |first=Barrett Edwards |date=2022-08-25 |title=X-Men: 5 Things About Rogue the MCU Needs to Get Right |url=https://gamerant.com/x-men-rogue-mcu-needs-to-get-right/ |access-date=2022-10-10 |website=Game Rant |language=en-US}}</ref> Rogue can absorb the memories, knowledge, talents, personality and physical abilities (whether superhuman or not) of the person she touches, as well as occasionally duplicating in herself physical characteristics of her victim.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Marvel Makes Major Change to Rogue's Powers |url=https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/marvel-x-men-rogue-powers-change-mr-and-mrs-x/ |access-date=2022-10-10 |website=Marvel |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Linyard |first=Taylor |date=2020-10-21 |title=X-Men: 10 Times Rogue Stole Another Hero's Powers |url=https://whatculture.com/comics/x-men-10-times-rogue-stole-another-heros-powers |access-date=2022-10-10 |website=WhatCulture.com |language=en}}</ref><ref name=":4">{{Cite web |last=Ford |first=Chantel Von |date=2022-09-30 |title=10 X-Men Characters Fans Want In the MCU |url=https://www.cbr.com/x-men-characters-fans-want-in-mcu/ |access-date=2022-10-10 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Lealos |first=Shawn S. |date=2019-06-27 |title=X-Men: 10 Mutants Who Are Close To Being Omega Level |url=https://screenrant.com/x-men-mutants-close-omega/ |access-date=2022-10-10 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref> The victim loses those abilities and memories for exactly the amount of time that Rogue possesses them. This absorption usually leaves the victim weakened and sometimes renders them unconscious. Their powers may also be temporarily weakened or removed. Rogue's power is constantly active, rendering her incapable of touching others without the absorption process taking place. However, evidence suggests that Rogue's inability to control her powers is psychological in nature. During the times when the Ms. Marvel personality would overtake her psyche, she was able to touch people freely.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #239 (December 1988). Marvel Comics.</ref> This fact has since been corroborated by the discovery that Rogue's absorption power never developed beyond the stage of its original manifestation.<ref name="X-Men: Legacy #224"/> Xavier later rectified this by telepathically removing the psychological barriers stunting it.<ref name="X-Men: Legacy #224"/>

The transfer of abilities is usually temporary, lasting for a period of time relative to how long contact is maintained, but if Rogue holds on to her victim for too long, the transfer may become permanent, leaving the victim nearly dead, as was the case with Ms. Marvel.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Garcia |first=Mayra |date=2022-02-12 |title=10 Coolest Characters Whose Powers Rogue Absorbed |url=https://www.cbr.com/coolest-characters-whose-powers-rogue-absorbed/ |access-date=2022-10-10 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> Ms. Marvel fought the transfer process, which Rogue attested to sometime after the incident occurred. Most often this process happens instantly when Rogue touches someone, but certain extraordinarily powerful beings have proven resistant to Rogue's power, and she may only share part of their memories and power, as was the case when Rogue once attempted to absorb power from the alien [[Magus (Technarchy)|Magus]]. However, in the process of doing so she gained an immunity to the Technarch transmode virus.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men 192">''Uncanny X-Men'' #192 (April 1985). Marvel Comics</ref><ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #242 (March 1989). Marvel Comics.</ref>

After coming into contact with the supervillain Pandemic, Rogue's powers were upgraded for a brief time into an instant death touch.<ref name="X-Men #199">''X-Men'' #199</ref> Using her upgraded powers, Rogue absorbed the Hecatomb and the psyches within it, putting her into a coma.<ref name="X-Men #199"/>

As Rogue is absorbing the total psyche of a person, there is a risk of a personality overwhelming her and taking control of her body. It has also been shown that even though the memories she has absorbed eventually fade when a psyche returns to its body, remnants, or "echoes", of the personalities of victims whose memories she has absorbed remain buried in her subconscious indefinitely, and while there is little to no risk of those personalities overwhelming her like the Ms. Marvel personality could, they can occasionally make their presences known.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Fully developed mutant abilities===
Following the conclusion of ''Messiah Complex'', Rogue's slate was wiped clean. The touch of mutant baby [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope]] mysteriously erased all of the previous memories and abilities Rogue had absorbed, including those of the Hecatomb. It also cured her of the Strain 88 virus. Rogue's touch now simply steals the memories and abilities of individuals with whom she comes in direct skin-to-skin contact. The longer the contact, the longer Rogue retains the absorbed information, powers, and also the abilities of the individuals she absorbs. She can now control her powers, making her touch lethal — or non-lethal — at will.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ashford |first=Sage |date=2021-11-20 |title=Marvel: The 10 Strongest Female X-Men |url=https://www.cbr.com/marvel-strongest-female-x-men/ |access-date=2022-09-09 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-04-08 |title=If Rogue Touched Thanos, Would She Absorb Gauntlet Powers? |url=https://www.themarysue.com/rogue-xmen-thanos-infinity-stones/ |access-date=2022-09-09 |website=The Mary Sue |language=en}}</ref>

Following the events of ''X-Men: Legacy'', Rogue appears to be able to activate her powers at will, as opposed to them being constantly active, as demonstrated when she kisses [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] without incident. Her inability to control her powers stemmed from mental blocks within her mind which formed each time she used her abilities, crippling the development of her powers from their nascent stage. When [[Professor X]]avier removes the blocks, her powers are allowed to develop normally.<ref name="X-Men: Legacy #224"/> With this new control, Rogue demonstrates the ability to absorb and collectively utilize all the powers of the New X-Men in order to defeat a rogue Predator X, with no apparent harm to either them or herself.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #517">''Uncanny X-Men'' #517</ref> Her power also affects aliens, such as when she was transferred to a planet in another dimension by Magik, and one of the aliens involuntarily touches her and she gains the ability to communicate in their language, along with their knowledge.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #271 (October 2012). Marvel Comics.</ref>

She later uses the version of her powers that renders victims unconscious against the Avengers during her fight with them, making the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] and the She-Hulk immediately unconscious and absorbing their powers without any negative feedback on her physical self (besides the She-Hulk's green skin).<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Coolest Powers Rogue Has Absorbed |url=https://www.sideshow.com/blog/the-coolest-powers-rogue-has-absorbed |access-date=2022-10-10 |website=Sideshow Collectibles |language=en}}</ref>

The new twist in Rogue's powers consists of prompting her victims of her skin-to-skin contact for a consent on the process. Rogue's victim can either resist the absorption and suffer, like originally with Rogue's powers, or instead submit to the absorption, and so the process instead becomes entirely fluent without consequences. Rogue has used this twist extensively in the Legacy series; just two examples of it are when aiding the victims of a subway collapse absorbing all rescuers' abilities in ''X-Men Legacy'' #274,<ref name="XMen274Vol2">''X-Men Legacy'' #274 (September 2012)</ref> and also when quenching a riot in a prison of mutants absorbing the existence of some mutant-volunteers in ''X-Men Legacy'' #275.<ref name="XMen275Vol2">''X-Men Legacy'' #275 (October 2012)</ref>

During ''Uncanny Avengers'', Rogue used her powers to absorb the energies of numerous superheroes to oppose the Celestial Executioner, stating that she had "been practicing"; she was even able to absorb the ionic energy-based powers of Wonder Man (whom she had been previously unable to absorb).<ref name="Uncanny Avengers 21"/> However, apparently due to the scale of the energies she absorbed in the process, Rogue's powers have reverted to their original state, unable to touch anyone without absorbing them automatically, and she retains Wonder Man's psyche and powers.<ref name="Uncanny Avengers 23"/>

Anna's powers underwent another change during a battle with the Shi'ar Imperial Guard and a decanting faction of radicals led by Deathbird. The genetically conceived offspring of Charles Xavier and Lilandra Neramani; Xandra had reached into Rogue's conscious mind and used her considerable telepathic abilities in order to kick start a change in her powers. Initially seemingly no different from before, Rogue's absorption abilities had been vastly augmented from what they were before, still having no control over her abilities, she now as the capacity to drain life energy and supernatural skills from other living beings a good distance away. Eliminating the need to physically touch anyone for her siphoning powers to take effect.<ref name="Mrs. X 2018"/> After such a harrowing endeavor Spiral showed her how to fix her broken abilities, taking her and Remy to the Mojoworld where Rogue dove into her own subconsciousness and came to terms with herself. Realizing that she had been purposefully limiting her own abilities out of personal fear, now coming to terms with her own shortcomings, Rogue regained control of her life force absorption power and could now willingly initiate the ranged mass absorption effect that Xandra unlocked within her.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

After the reboot of X-Men with the release of House of X and Powers of X, Rogue's power absorption is once again proved to be lethal. She could easily kill Apocalypse with mere skin-to-skin touch, resulting in almost instant death with Apocalypse's body withered as she is done absorbing his life-force. The result of her power absorption was that she got Apocalypse's blue skin, although the effect disappeared not long after.<ref>''Excalibur'' #5 (2019)</ref>

===Ms. Marvel powers===
As a young woman, Rogue permanently absorbed the superhuman powers and the psyche of [[Carol Danvers]], the original [[Ms. Marvel]].<ref name="debut"/><ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-04-08 |title=If Rogue Touched Thanos, Would She Absorb Gauntlet Powers? |url=https://www.themarysue.com/rogue-xmen-thanos-infinity-stones/ |access-date=2022-10-10 |website=The Mary Sue |language=en}}</ref> This provided her with superhuman strength, stamina, durability, reflexes, speed and a seventh sense.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Connolly |first=Spencer |date=2022-06-13 |title=Rogue Only Joined the X-Men Because of One Avenger |url=https://screenrant.com/rogue-xmen-team-member-captain-marvel-comics/ |access-date=2022-10-10 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Smith |first=Barrett Edwards |date=2022-08-25 |title=X-Men: 5 Things About Rogue the MCU Needs to Get Right |url=https://gamerant.com/x-men-rogue-mcu-needs-to-get-right/ |access-date=2022-10-10 |website=Game Rant |language=en-US}}</ref> She was able to repel bullets and fly at sub-sonic speeds, much like Ms. Marvel could. In addition, she possessed an amalgamated mutant human/Kree physiology that rendered her resistant to most toxins and poisons, with the added effect of making her virtually invulnerable.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #172-173 (August – September 1983). Marvel Comics</ref>

Rogue also gained a precognitive "seventh sense" that enables her to unconsciously predict an enemy's move during battle. She used this ability to predict where [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] would teleport and from which direction [[Magus (Technarchy)|Magus]] of the Technarchy would attack.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men 192"/> This ability was not always reliable, however, and would randomly and sporadically activate.{{issue|date=March 2015}}

When she possessed Carol Danvers' psyche, her "dual" psyche made her highly resistant to telepathic probes, even those of [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], which was said to have been a byproduct of two minds existing in one body and/or Carol Danvers' human/Kree physiology.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men' 1983"/> The Ms. Marvel psyche was eventually separated from Rogue's in a subsequent issue,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #247 (August, 1989)</ref><ref>''Extreme X-Men Volume 1'' (2002)</ref> and it was destroyed by Magneto.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #269 (October, 1990)</ref>

===Powerless===
For a time Rogue lost all of her powers, including her original mutant ones, after she was critically injured in a fight with the mysterious warrior [[Vargas (comics)|Vargas]].<ref name="X-Treme X-Men' 2004"/> During this period, she displayed exceptional fighting skills and agility, though it was said these were not superhuman in nature.

She also still possessed a "fluid genome" that enabled Sage to use her as a conduit through which to channel the mutant powers of the [[X-Treme X-Men]] team in a fight against Bogan.<ref>''X-Treme X-Men'' #21</ref>

===Sunfire powers===
In the short-lived volume 3 of her self-titled series (2004–2005), Rogue absorbed a large portion of the mutant Sunfire's solar-absorption based powers. In addition to her own natural mutant abilities, Rogue could then project intense heat and flame, envelop her body in a fiery aura, fly by focusing her power downwards in a tight stream to propel her like a rocket, focus her power inward to increase her strength (though not at her Ms. Marvel levels), exercise immunity to heat and radiation, and see the infrared spectrum.<ref>''Rogue'' (vol. 3) #11 (May 2005). Marvel Comics.</ref> Rogue was eventually purged of these abilities when she came into contact with Hope Summers.{{issue|date=September 2013}}

===Wonder Man powers===
Rogue currently possesses [[Wonder Man]]'s essence, including his powers and psyche. Her organic tissues have been permeated with ionic energy, granting her an array of superhuman abilities. She possesses superhuman strength sufficient enough to lift well over 100 tons, as well as some degree of superhuman speed, agility and reflexes. In addition, Rogue is virtually invulnerable to damage and is capable of flying at high speeds. Rogue's eyes glow in the dark and her vision extends somewhat into the infrared spectrum, allowing her to see in the dark. Her new ionic physiology also grants her a form of immortality, protecting her from age and disease.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Coolest Powers Rogue Has Absorbed |url=https://www.sideshow.com/blog/the-coolest-powers-rogue-has-absorbed |access-date=2022-09-09 |website=Sideshow Collectibles |language=en}}</ref>

===Natural skills===
Rogue has shown a fair knowledge of unarmed combat when in a position where she has to fight in situations where she cannot simply use her powers to knock out her foe. She has also received a degree of training from Professor X to protect herself against even subtle telepathic attacks, this training allowing her to escape Kobik's reprogramming of various Avengers and villains to reassemble her teammates against this new threat when even experienced telepaths like Cable were trapped in the illusion.<ref name="UncanAven3#8"/>

==Real name==
In the ''Going Rogue'' arc of her 2004 ongoing series,<ref name="GoingRogue"/> Rogue's real name is finally established as Anna Marie. Rogue reaches her childhood home of Caldecott County, where her surviving maternal aunt and the [[shamanism|shamanistic]] incarnation of her mother repeatedly refer to her as "Anna Marie"; Gambit also refers to her as "Anna" instead of "Rogue". Rogue learns her true given name at birth was "Anna Marie" from the absorbed memories of her aunt, who helped raise Rogue with Rogue's father after Rogue's mother vanished from their home. Rogue acknowledges the name uttering: "(Anna Marie) Th-that's my name...," right after a shamanistic [[doppelgänger]] of Rogue mentions it, and later she says: "I-It's me. Anna," once after finding Gambit in the dream world.<ref name="GoingRogue"/>

Throughout the ''X-Men Legacy'' series, Rogue is repeatedly called "Anna" by Mystique, in childhood memories of Caldecott County (''X-Men'' #200, August 2007),<ref name="XMen200Vol2"/> after healing in Muir Island (''X-Men'' #207, March 2008),<ref name="XMen207Vol2">'''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #207 (March 2008)</ref> and in moments of solitude at the Australian desert (''X-Men'' #215, 220–222, 224).<ref name="XMen220Vol2">''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #220 (March 2009).

In ''X-Men: Legacy'' #238, Rogue is identified as "Anna Marie, [[Pseudonym|aka]] Rogue," overflying [[Mumbai]] aboard an airliner together with Magneto, and then Rogue also introduces herself as "Anna Marie" to [[Indra (comics)|Indra]]'s parents,<ref name="X-Men: Legacy #238">''X-Men: Legacy'' #238 (September 2010).

Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the [[20th Century Fox]] films ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'', ''[[X2 (film)|X2: X-Men United]]'', ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'', and ''[[X-Men: Days Of Future Past]]'', Rogue's real first name is Marie. According to the official novelization of ''X-Men'', her surname in the film series is "D'Ancanto".

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
Martyn Warren of ''[[Screen Rant]]'' referred to Rogue as "one of the greatest X-Men of all," writing, "Rogue made her first appearance in ''Avengers Annual'' #10 in 1981 and since her debut, she has become one of the most recognizable super-powered mutant members of the X-Men. Her power to absorb the lifeforce of humans and the powers of mutants with physical contact does make her a potentially dangerous ally. But with such a caring heart and an upbeat personality, she always takes a challenge head-on, no matter how difficult it is. With multiple appearances in comics, television shows, and films, she has gained a huge fan base who treasure the many quotes she has delivered over the past 40 years."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Warren |first=Martyn |date=2022-01-12 |title=10 Quotes That Prove Rogue Is The Best X-Men Member |url=https://screenrant.com/rogue-quotes-best-x-men-member/ |access-date=2022-08-29 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref> Michael Austin of ''[[CBR.com]]'' called Rogue "one of X-Men's most popular women," saying, "One of the most popular superhero teams of all time, the X-Men's roster is made up of many different iconic characters. Marvel has also used those characters to craft some of the best stories in comic book history. One of the most important of these characters is Rogue. Although initially a villain, Rogue quickly rose to become one of the most popular X-Men. She has come a long way since her villainous beginnings and has been a part in some of the best X-Men teams and stories ever."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Austin |first=Michael |date=2019-07-08 |title=X-Men: 10 Most Important Rogue Stories Of All Time |url=https://www.cbr.com/x-men-important-rogue-stories/ |access-date=2022-08-29 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> Darren Franich of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' described Rogue as one of the characters "who left a significant footprint on X-history," asserting, "She's been a young villain-ingenue and a flowing-hair babe with a Gambit fixation, but there's always something fundamentally sad and fascinating about Rogue. Her superpower is tragic at the level of great science fiction: If she touches anyone, she absorbs their powers, their memories, and their whole life. (Touch them too long and they die.) Rogue is how you teach kids about melancholy."<ref name="Let's rank every X-Man ever">{{Cite web |last1=June 09 |first1=Darren Franich Updated |last2=EDT |first2=2022 at 12:31 PM |title=Let's rank every X-Man ever |url=https://ew.com/article/2014/05/21/x-men-best-worst/ |access-date=2022-08-29 |website=EW.com |language=en}}</ref> Jacob Threadgill of ''[[The Clarion-Ledger]]'' stated, "Hailing from fictional Caldecott County, Mississippi, the character Rogue has gone from misunderstood villain to one of the most beloved female characters in comic book history as a member of the X-Men. In popular culture, Rogue’s backstory of isolation as a confused teen who has the ability to absorb fellow mutants' powers, memory and personality has struck a chord with fans worldwide."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Threadgill |first=Jacob |title=X-Men's Rogue: From Mississippi and proud of it |url=https://www.clarionledger.com/story/magnolia/entertainment/2016/06/23/x-mens-rogue-mississippi-and-proud/86179080/ |access-date=2022-10-10 |website=The Clarion-Ledger |language=en-US}}</ref>

George Marston of ''[[Newsarama]]'' referred to Rogue as one of the "best X-Men members of all time," asserting, "Rogue started out as a villain, but for the Avengers rather than the X-Men. Since reforming to heroism, Rogue has become one of the most long running and powerful members of the X-Men."<ref>{{Cite web |author1=George Marston |date=2022-07-18 |title=Best X-Men members of all time |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/best-x-men-members-of-all-time/ |access-date=2022-10-10 |website=gamesradar |language=en}}</ref> Matthew Aguilar of ''[[ComicBook.com]]'' asserted, "Over the years the X-Man known as Rogue has seen many changes to her powers, costume, and even personality. Those are interesting in their own right, but today the focus is squarely on the many looks she's adopted over the years, each of which has its own cadre of fans. The character left quite the impression on the Avengers in her first appearance (1981's ''Avengers Annual'' #10), and ever since she's been a stalwart of the X-Men universe. Granted she started out on the wrong side of things, but hey, it doesn't matter where you start, only where you finish. Fortune cookie psychology aside, Rogue appeals to fans because of her unyielding charisma, her southern charm, and an intriguing powerset that comes with its own struggles. She can fly, lift a tank, and punch through a wall, but being cut off from physical contact with others has always been a fly in the ointment, and that struggle is an essential part of the character."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ranking The Top Rogue Costumes |url=https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/ranking-the-top-rogue-costumes/ |access-date=2022-09-09 |website=Marvel |language=en}}</ref> Matthew Perpetua of ''[[BuzzFeed]]'' stated, "She's easily one of the best characters on a purely thematic level. She's a walking, talking metaphor for sexual anxiety, particularly during the AIDS epidemic of the '80s – she can't touch ANYONE without absorbing part of them and potentially killing them. The character has suffered a bit in recent years thanks to writers insisting on giving her control over her powers and reversing a lot of what makes her special, but Rick Remender has done a good job of reconnecting Rogue with her impulsive, surly roots over in ''Uncanny Avengers''."<ref name="Perpetua">{{Cite web |last=Perpetua |first=Matthew |title=95 X-Men Members Ranked From Worst To Best |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/perpetua/94-x-men-members-ranked-from-worst-to-best |access-date=2022-08-29 |website=BuzzFeed |language=en}}</ref>  Sara Century of ''[[Syfy]]'' said, "Gambit and Rogue are a couple that becomes infinitely more intriguing due to their ability to find stability with one another. The easier and more lighthearted the dynamic, the sexier it becomes. In more recent days, Rogue and Gambit have gone from being a hopelessly melodramatic and toxic pairing to being the X-Men’s most endearing couple. They worked through their issues together in therapy and reunited in a surprisingly healthy way. When Kitty Pryde left Colossus at the altar, Gambit took the opportunity to propose to Rogue, and they turned attention from an exhausted relationship to a promising new future together. Without question, Gambit and Rogue are at their very best now, and it’s refreshing to read a couple who are just flat-out good for one another in a mythos mired so often in frustration and personal tragedy."<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-01-19 |title=Exploring intimacy issues with Gambit and Rogue |url=https://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/exploring-intimacy-issues-with-gambit-and-rogue |access-date=2022-09-09 |website=SYFY Official Site |language=en-US}}</ref>

CBR Staff of ''[[CBR.com]]'' called ''Rogue & Gambit'' #1 a "promising first issue," saying, "I know Rogue and Gambit are one of the canonical Big Romances of superhero comics, but I couldn’t say for sure that I’ve ever actually read a comic with the two of them together as a couple. Not that this presents any real barrier to reading ''Rogue & Gambit'' #1. The issue does a great job of positioning them and their relationship in simple, understandable terms. [...] Given it’s a story about a couple reconnecting, or failing to, a little awkwardness between the two leads is actually quite appropriate. Whether the art is able to turn up the heat -- and indeed whether the developing relationship of Rogue and Gambit will require it to -- remains to be seen, but this first issue certainly has me crossing my fingers."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Staff |first=C.

However, it tries to have its cake and eat it too. It's not action-heavy enough to feel like a good superhero tale, but it's not calm enough to shoot for slice-of-life. While comics like ''Hawkeye, Astonishing Ant-Man'', and ''Spider Woman'' have managed to make that balance work in the past, this one doesn't. If you really do like these two X-Men as a couple, then you should definitely check it out. It will likely give you exactly what you want. However, if you're looking to be sold on them as a couple, then, like myself, you probably won't get much out of it."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Davison |first=Joshua |date=2018-01-04 |title=Rogue and Gambit #1 Review: Gambit Needs to Chill a Bit |url=https://bleedingcool.com/comics/rogue-and-gambit-1-review/ |access-date=2022-08-29 |website=Bleeding Cool News And Rumors |language=en}}</ref>

Jamie Lovett of ''[[ComicBook.com]]'' asserted, "In a very real way, Thompson, Bazaldua, and D'Armata have with ''Mr. and Mrs. X'' #1 delivered the comic book that many fans have been waiting their entire comics-reading lives to read.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' reality, Rogue is brought to [[Alternative versions of Magneto#Age of Apocalypse|Magneto]] and his X-Men for education in her powers by Mystique.<ref>''X-Men Chronicles'' #01 (1995)</ref> Soon after this, Rogue would battle against Apocalypse's son Nemesis (who later became Holocaust) alongside the Scarlet Witch, and would witness the death of the latter. During the next few years, Rogue would express an attraction to both Gambit and the leader of the X-Men, Magneto. She would ultimately become romantically involved with Magneto after he worked out a way for them to touch by surrounding his body in a tight electromagnetic 'sheath' that prevented her from ''actually'' making contact with his skin, while still feeling as though she was. The two would later conceive a son named [[Magnus Lehnsherr#Age of Apocalypse|Charles]], after Charles Xavier, who was slain by [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]] whose target had actually been Magneto himself.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} The Age of Apocalypse universe was later revealed to have been preserved due to the actions of [[Jean Grey]]. Rogue and Magneto, along with that reality's X-Men continue their lives.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}. This reality's version of Rogue had her uncontrollable absorption abilities and permanently possessed around half of Polaris' magnetic abilities. Unlike her husband Magneto and Polaris herself, Rogue appeared to prefer to use these abilities to fly and augment her physical strength and durability to superhuman levels.

===Age of X===
Rogue appears in the [[Age of X]] continuity going by the name Legacy (also known as the Reaper). She is not allowed to be in the forefront of battles, but has the sole purpose of using her powers to absorb the memories and powers of dying mutants,<ref>''X-Men Legacy'' #245</ref> as well as those of Captain America after he sacrificed himself to save Fortress X from the [[Alternative versions of Hulk#Age of X|Hulk]].<ref>''Age of X: Universe'' #2</ref> She becomes curious when [[Kitty Pryde]] is caught getting back into the grounds and finds a camera - which, suspiciously, has hundreds of blank photos. This results in her questioning everything and figures that she can get answers only from Kitty, who is imprisoned. She goes against orders and infiltrates the prison, coming across [[Blindfold (comics)|Blindfold]] and, later, [[Professor X]]avier. After absorbing the Professor's powers, she realizes that everything is not what it seems to be.<ref>''New Mutants'' #22</ref> However, she cannot control his powers and unleashes a psychic attack on all mutants in the Fortress. Considered as a traitor, she is hunted by [[Moonstar (comics)|Moonstar]] and her team. She flees to [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]], who dresses her wounds. She confesses that she is puzzled by how she seems to know Charles Xavier but cannot figure out how; at the same time, his memories paint a different picture of everything. Moonstar tracks her and she is shot down when fleeing. [[Gambit (Marvel Comics)|Gambit]] rescues her, but Magneto seemingly buries them under a pile of rubble for their "traitorous" actions.<ref>''X-Men Legacy'' #246</ref> This was a ruse, as Magneto himself was suspicious and was the individual who dispatched Kitty to take the photos.<ref name="New Mutants #23">''New Mutants'' #23</ref> Following information from Magneto, Rogue and Gambit break into a secret chamber and find that the culprit behind the alternative reality is Moira, an alternate persona of [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]].<ref name="New Mutants #23"/>

===Amalgam Comics===
In the [[Amalgam Comics]] limited run, Rogue is combined with the [[DC Comics]] character [[Gypsy (comics)|Gypsy]] to form the new character [[Runaway (Amalgam Comics)|Runaway]].<ref>''JLX'' #1 (April 1996)</ref>

===''Exiles''===
In the ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|New Exiles]]'' series, Rogue is from [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Earth-1009]] and comes from a life of "wealth, privilege and sophistication."<ref>Portfolio Review (promotion to ''New Exiles'', published in ''Astonishing X-Men'' #23 (January 2008))</ref> Apparently a master thief, she has a different personality from her [[Earth-616]] version. She can absorb others' abilities and memories through her hands, but unlike the original Rogue, the rest of her body can be touched without ill effects. Moreover, she can keep the borrowed powers and use them at will.<ref>''New Exiles'' #16 (February 2009)</ref> In addition, she possesses [[super strength]], durability, the ability to fly, the ability to disintegrate matter with a touch, and the ability to heal others' wounds.{{issue|date=February 2013}} Her bodysuit hides mysterious [[tattoo]]s.<ref>''New Exiles'' #10 (October 2008)</ref>

===''House of M''===
The ''[[House of M]]'' Rogue is an agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and part of the Red Guard, working with [[Alternative versions of Wolverine#House of M|Wolverine]], [[Mystique (comics)#House of M|Mystique]], the [[Toad (Marvel Comics)|Toad]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)#House of M|Nightcrawler]], and [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)#House of M|Jessica Drew]]. She plays an important role in the resistance to Magneto. After being contacted by the resistance movement, Rogue briefly touches [[Layla Miller]] and appears overwhelmed, as the acquired power emanated from her and awakened others in the vicinity to the reality of the House.{{Issue|date=November 2009}} In the final battle, Rogue, finally able to unleash her powers to their full extent, tackles both [[Namor]] and Princess [[Alternative versions of Storm#House of M|Ororo]] and absorbs their abilities, causing her to overflow with power. She even absorbed the powers of [[Genis-Vell]]. Due to the nature of Genis' genetics and powers, half of Rogue's body transforms into a seemingly window to a cosmic landscape of black void dotted with stars. During the final battle, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] finds the cosmically powered Rogue waiting up top. Pietro slams into Rogue and is sent flying back.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

===Marvel 1602===
A version of Rogue appears in the Marvel 1602 spin-off "Angela: Witchunter".

===''Marvel Noir''===
Rogue appears in ''[[X-Men Noir]]'' as Anne-Marie Rankin, one of [[Alternative versions of Professor X#X-Men Noir|Professor Xavier]]'s students. She has a talent for imitating the personality traits and mannerisms of any person, allowing her to fit into any situation. Professor Xavier considered her a missing link or patient zero in his theories about sociopathy as the next stage of human behavioral evolution.<ref>''X-Men Noir'' #1-4 (February–May 2009)</ref>

===''Marvel Zombies''===
During the ''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]'' crossover where the Ultimate Universe's Fantastic Four visit the [[Marvel Zombies]] Universe, Rogue is seen as a zombified hero in one of the panels before the infection spread out.<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #22</ref>

===Mutant X===
In this darker reality, Rogue operates with a smaller X-Team consisting of Magneto, Nightcrawler, Polaris, Quicksilver, [[Cerebo]], and a metallic-looking Mystique. Rogue herself maintains the steel and ridged skin of [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], having unintentionally absorbed his power when her glove disintegrated while she was trying to carry him to safety, and wears a version of [[Ms. Marvel]]'s lightning bolt uniform.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

===''Prelude to Deadpool Corps''===
In issue #2, [[Deadpool]] visits a world where Rogue and [[Jean Grey]] are orphaned kids at an orphanage run by [[Emma Frost]]. At a dance where Professor X and Emma's orphans can have fun, Rogue can be seen calling Kidpool (a kid version of Deadpool who attends the Professor X Orphanage for Troubled Kids) a dork.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

===Professor W’s X-Men===
Rogue has defected from the X-Men in this series to join [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]]' new [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]. This drastic change in alliance can be partially attributed to the fact Rogue has fully absorbed the powers and life force of the [[Super-Skrull]], gaining his Skrull alien traits, the powers of all the members of the [[Fantastic Four]], as well as Kl'rt's personality and memories. As a result of this absorption, Rogue's own personality has become warped, even regarded by her own teammates as acting villainous.<ref>''Exiles'' #42 (April 2004)</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===<!-- This section is linked from [[Iceman (comics)]] -->
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, Rogue is first introduced in the story arc ''Return to Weapon X''<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #7-12 (August 2001 – January 2002)</ref> as a prisoner of [[Weapon X#Ultimate Weapon X|Weapon X]] and she worked with the [[Juggernaut (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Juggernaut]] and [[Nightcrawler (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Nightcrawler]]. In this version, her name appears to be Marian Carlyle.<ref>Ultimate Comics X-Men #1</ref> Her powers are exploited to steal sensitive information on the location and layout of [[X-Mansion#Ultimate Marvel|the Xavier Institute for Gifted Children]]. Using this information, agents of Weapon X storm the school and capture the X-Men. Rogue is released along with the X-Men, the Juggernaut, and Nightcrawler, when a combination of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants#Ultimate Brotherhood|Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.#Ultimate S.H.I.E.L.D.|S.H.I.E.L.D]] rescues them and destroys Weapon X's facility. Though offered a place on the X-Men, she joins the Brotherhood. She later joins the X-Men in the ''Return of the King'' arc.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #27-33 (March–July 2003)</ref>

In the ''Cry Wolf'' story arc,<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #50-53 (October 2003 – January 2004)</ref> the X-Men are attacked by [[Alternative versions of Gambit#Ultimate Marvel|Gambit]] who kidnaps Rogue and takes her to his employers, [[Fenris (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Andreas and Andrea von Strucker]]. They hope to use her powers for "[[Industrial espionage|corporate espionage]]". In exchange for her help, they promise her they will help her control her powers through a power-dampening material they had developed. She turns them down, feeling that her powers are her penance. Rebuked, they attack Rogue and Gambit. She touches both of them and uses their powers to fend off their guards. The X-Men arrive to take her back, but she turns them down and leaves with Gambit.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #53 (January 2004)</ref>

Rogue does not appear again until ''Ultimate X-Men Annual'' #1, in which she and Gambit fight the Juggernaut. Gambit sacrifices himself to save Rogue and she kisses him as he dies at his request. With this kiss, she takes his powers that seemingly override her own, ridding her of her 'death touch' through several of the books (this also affects Rogue's appearance, as she acquires black eyes with red irises). In the subsequent story arc ''Date Night'',<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #66-69 (March–June 2006)</ref> Rogue decides to rekindle her relationship with the [[Iceman (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Iceman]] after she loses her virginity to him (something possible due to her being able to touch him now).<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #66 (March 2006)</ref>

During ''Ultimate X-Men Annual'' #2, Rogue speaks to [[Alternative versions of Professor X#Ultimate Marvel|Professor Xavier]] about her concerns regarding Gambit's powers still remaining. Xavier theorizes this is only a temporary change and her powers will return within time. Towards the end of the ''Annual'', Rogue touches a delusional Nightcrawler and her old powers re-emerge, causing her to start teleporting randomly, and she loses Gambit's power, sending her back into the shell of hiding her skin, much to her and the Iceman's dismay.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men Annual'' #2</ref>

During ''Ultimate X-Men'' #77, she loses her arm during a fight with [[Cable (comics)#Ultimate Cable|Cable]]. However, after absorbing some of [[Ultimate Wolverine|Wolverine]]'s healing power, her arm appears to grow back.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #77</ref>

In ''Ultimate X-Men'' #80, Cyclops disbands the X-Men following Xavier's death. Rogue stays with the Iceman at the Xavier Institute as a student. Xavier later returns and reveals himself to be alive. Rogue once again becomes an X-Man. At the end of ''Ultimate X-Men'', a [[Banshee (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Banshee]]-enhanced Rogue is seen to be a member of [[Colossus (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Colossus]]' team. Her appearance heavily altered, it seems her abilities have been enhanced such that she can call on absorbed abilities, as she has Colossus' armored flesh and the [[Warren Worthington III#Ultimate Marvel|Angel]]'s feathered wings extending from her arms. While telling Cyclops the benefits of Banshee she kisses him; when asked why, she replies "'Cause I can."<ref name="ultx95">''Ultimate X-Men'' #95</ref>

In ''Ultimate X-Men'' #95, she reveals that when her father got drunk he would [[Sexual abuse|molest]] her. Once when he tried to touch her, she took his life. She also appears to have found out who [[Kestrel (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate John Wraith|Vindicator]] was, but before she could elaborate, Vindicator took her out.<ref name="ultx95"/>

Addicted to Banshee, Colossus' X-Men began to acquire more Banshee from the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]]. When they were discovered by the others, a battle raged. She absorbed the Iceman's power and kissed him to show what Banshee could allow her, but the kiss was broken off by [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]]. Hostilities ceased when [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]] turns up — alive, but crippled.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #97</ref>

After the Ultimatum Wave hits [[Manhattan]], Jean refuses to allow Rogue to join her, as she cannot be trusted. Rogue then attacks [[Department H]], absorbing [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]]'s power and attacked [[Jubilee (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Jubilee]]. It is then revealed that Vindicator is, in fact, John Wraith, whom she blames for ruining her life. She threatens him for help in killing [[Alternative versions of Magneto#Ultimate Marvel|Magneto]]. They travel to [[Montreal]], where Rogue poses as a stripper to get close to Sabretooth and the Juggernaut.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #98 (January 2009)</ref> The Purifiers soon attack the X-Mansion and the Juggernaut dies fighting alongside Rogue. Rogue absorbs his powers just before he dies and now permanently possesses them. She then helps the X-Men in their effort to defeat Magneto and his Brotherhood. They do so, but suffer many casualties. Rogue is one of the few X-Men to survive to battle alongside [[Alternative versions of Jean Grey#Ultimate Marvel|Jean Grey]], the Iceman, [[Alternative versions of Kitty Pryde#Ultimate Marvel|Shadowcat]], [[Alternative versions of Storm#Ultimate Marvel|Storm]], and Colossus. She is last seen helping Jean Grey and the Iceman tear down the Xavier Institute and everything on the estate. They bury the remains of the deceased X-Men in its place.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men: Requiem'' (September 2009)</ref>

===''What If?''===
In "What If the X-Men Stayed in Asgard", Rogue is one of the [[X-Men]] and [[New Mutants]] to remain in [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] when she finds that her powers does not affect the [[Asgardians (Marvel Universe)|Asgardians]]. She finally ends up falling in love with and marrying [[Fandral]] of the [[Warriors Three]], whose place is subsequently taken by Nightcrawler.<ref>''What If?'' (vol. 2) #12</ref>

In "What If Rogue possessed the power of Thor?", Rogue accidentally permanently absorbed [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] when she and Mystique attempted to break the Brotherhood out of prison, resulting in her killing most of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the Brotherhood when she was unable to cope with Thor's power. Although [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] attempted to manipulate her into waging war on Asgard after she was able to lift [[Mjolnir (comics)|Thor's hammer]], the sight of [[Odin (comics)|Odin]]'s genuine sense of loss allowed Thor's remnants to manifest in her subconscious, affirming that he was an ideal as well as a person, allowing Rogue to inherit his power and position as she became the new Thor.<ref>''What If'' (vol. 2) #66</ref>

In "What If Mystique had raised Nightcrawler?", Rogue's attempt to free Nightcrawler from the attic where Mystique had kept him to 'protect' him resulted in him being mortally injured by the Brotherhood when they mistook him for an X-Man; Rogue's attempt to use his power to escape resulted in her permanently absorbing Nightcrawler's powers and appearance due to the prolonged contact she maintained.<ref>''What If'' (vol. 2) #98</ref>

In ''What If?'' (vol. 2) #114, the heroes taken to the Beyonder's Battleworld never returned to Earth. In this reality, Rogue is called Carol, implying that the absorbed Ms. Marvel persona is the dominant consciousness. Because Carol is in control, Rogue's absorption powers are under control and she is married to [[Captain America]]. They also have a daughter together named Sarah, who inherited some of her mother's abilities and is known as the Crusader. This version of Rogue appears to have her original mutant powers, as well as Ms. Marvel's powers. It was also shown that she wears Ms. Marvel's costume into battle.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

In the ''What If?'' story "Bullet Points", in which a single bullet changed the history of [[Bruce Banner]], [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]], [[Iron Man|Anthony Stark]], and [[Captain America|Steven Rogers]], Rogue is seen alongside the X-Men of this reality, and appears in her iconic costume. She presumably has the same history as her mainstream counterpart and possesses both her own mutant abilities and the powers of Ms. Marvel. She later assists her teammates and many other heroes and villains against Galactus and watches as the Silver Surfer dies to prevent Earth from being devoured.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

In the "What If Xavier's Secret Second Team had Survived Krakoa?" storyline, Rogue is seen as a member of [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]]'s X-Men. She seems to possess both her own mutant abilities as well as the powers of Ms. Marvel, as she is seen flying and wearing gloves. Her history is presumably the same as her mainstream counterpart, though she wears a blue uniform and yellow gloves rather than her iconic costume.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===''X-Men: The End''===
In an alternative future featured in the series ''[[X-Men: The End]]'', Rogue and [[Alternative versions of Gambit#X-Men: The End|Gambit]] are married and have two children named Olivier and Rebecca "Becca" LeBeau. Rogue has also gained complete control over her abilities in this timeline. This Rogue defeats [[Shaitan]] and rescues her children from the Neverland Camp, but was ultimately killed by [[Mister Sinister]] when he was disguised as Gambit.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

===''X-Men Forever''===
In this reality, Rogue has absorbed Nightcrawler's abilities when he gave her mouth-to-mouth, granting her Nightcrawler's skin and tail as well as exceptional athletic abilities, although this has also left Nightcrawler with Rogue's powers and looking like a normal human. Claremont has kept the plot thread from ''Fall of the Mutants'' concerning the X-Men's encounter with Roma intact, and so Rogue is still rendered undetectable to cameras, appearing only as a blur on screen or film. While exploring her new powers, Rogue runs into Spider-Man and spends the night fighting crime alongside him; she suggests that they kiss to see if her original abilities have been affected by her transformation, but they are interrupted by a [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] attack before they can actually make contact.<ref>''X-Men Forever'' (vol. 2) #3 (September 2010)</ref>

===''Uncanny Avengers''===
In the [[Age of Ultron]] storyline, Rogue and [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] are a married couple, leading the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]]. [[Captain America]] approaches them in the tunnels with the intent of escorting [[Caliban (Marvel Comics)|Caliban]] for a trial. However, the meeting is interrupted by the [[Apocalypse Twins]], who are on a mission to kill Captain America. In the end, they kill Havok (when he defends Captain America) and Rogue (when she retaliates for Havok's death).<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #8 AU</ref>

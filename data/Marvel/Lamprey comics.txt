The '''Squadron Supreme''' is a <!--Do not add "fictional" as it is tautological; superheroes (and characters in general) are by definition implied to be fictionalized to some extent.-->[[superhero]] team appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], of which there are several notable alternate versions. The original team was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[John Buscema]], derived from the previously created supervillain team [[Squadron Sinister]].

The core members of the Squadron Supreme are [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]], [[Nighthawk (Squadron Supreme)|Nighthawk]], [[Doctor Spectrum#Joseph Ledger (Earth-712)|Doctor Spectrum]], [[Power Princess]], and the [[Whizzer (Stanley Stewart)|Whizzer]], pastiches of prominent members of rival publisher [[DC Comics]]' superhero team the [[Justice League]].<ref name="Eury">{{cite book |last1=Eury |first1=Michael |title=The Justice League Companion: A Historical and Speculative Overview of the Silver Age Justice League of America |date=2005 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |isbn=9781893905481 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QxJPl_R0FtwC |access-date=November 8, 2018 |language=en}}</ref>{{rp|72}} Many other characters were later added to the roster, not all of which were based on DC heroes.

== Publication history ==
The Squadron Supreme has its roots in the [[Squadron Sinister]], which first appeared in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #69 as a pastiche of the Justice League.<ref name="Eury"/>{{rp|40}} [[Roy Thomas]] later introduced a heroic version of the Squadron Sinister named the Squadron Supreme, which first appeared in ''The Avengers'' #85–86 (Feb.–March 1971), and which was co-created with [[John Buscema]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=[[DK (publisher)|DK]] |isbn=9781465455505 |page=148 |edition=Updated and expanded}}</ref> The team then had guest appearances on several more occasions, and in 1985 was featured in a self-titled twelve-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] by [[Mark Gruenwald]].

In 2003, a reimagined Squadron Supreme appeared in an ongoing series entitled ''Supreme Power'', published under the mature-audience [[Max (comics)|MAX]] imprint. This version was created by writer [[J. Michael Straczynski]] and artist [[Gary Frank (comics)|Gary Frank]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2021}} Yet another Squadron Supreme was introduced in 2015, written by [[James Robinson (writer)|James Robinson]] and drawn by [[Leonard Kirk]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2021}} Unlike the previous teams, which had appeared in alternate realities, this team was based in Marvel's main "Earth-616" reality, although the team members were from a variety of alternate universes that had been destroyed in the aftermath of the 2015 ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' event.

Another version of the Squadron Supreme, set in the Marvel Universe, was introduced by [[Jason Aaron]] in ''The Avengers'' vol. 8.{{Citation needed|date=May 2021}} The Squadron, created by [[Mephisto (Marvel Comics)|Mephisto]] and led by Phil Coulson, acts as the US government's sanctioned superhero team in place of the Avengers. This version of the team is the focus of the ''[[Heroes Reborn (2021 comic)|Heroes Reborn]]'' storyline, where reality is overwritten so that the Avengers were never formed and the Squadron Supreme are Earth's premier superhero team instead.{{Citation needed|date=May 2021}}

== Fictional team biography ==
{{Overly detailed|section|date=April 2020}}

=== Earth-712 version ===
The Squadron Supreme are first encountered by four members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] – the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], the [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Goliath]] – who have arrived in the Earth-712 universe by mistake.<ref>''The Avengers'' #84 (Jan. 1971)</ref> The Avengers are initially confused, since several members of the Squadron Supreme have identical names and powers to the [[Squadron Sinister]], a group of previously encountered villains.<ref>''The Avengers'' #69–70 (Oct.–Nov. 1969)</ref> After a brief battle, the Avengers assist the Squadron Supreme against the global threat posed by the mutant [[Brain-Child]], before returning to their own universe.<ref>''The Avengers'' #85–86 (Feb.–March 1971)</ref> The Squadron Supreme have another series of skirmishes with the Avengers engineered by the group the '''Serpent Cartel''', but eventually they join forces and prevent the use of the [[Serpent Crown]].<ref>''The Avengers'' #141–144 (Nov. 1975–Feb. 1976) and 147–149 (May–July 1976)</ref>

The team features briefly in the title ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'', when the evil version of [[Hyperion (Zhib-Ran)|Hyperion]] attacks the Earth-712 version and then the Earth-616 Thor.<ref>''Thor'' #280 (Feb. 1979)</ref> The Squadron appear in the title ''The [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'' as mind-controlled pawns of the entities the [[Overmind (comics)|Over-Mind]] and Null the Living Darkness, but are freed and aid the Defenders in defeating the villains.<ref>''The Defenders'' #112–114 (Oct.–Dec. 1982)</ref> Earth-712, however, is left in a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] state.{{issue|date=June 2019}}

The Squadron Supreme were next featured in a self-titled 12-issue [[miniseries]] (Sept. 1985–Aug. 1986) by writer [[Mark Gruenwald]],<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #1–12 (Sept. 1985–Aug. 1986)</ref> which picks up from where Earth-712 was last seen in ''The Defenders'' #114. The Squadron, led by Hyperion, believe they have the knowledge and power to recreate the world and create a [[utopia]]. Nighthawk protests, believing that the Squadron should serve and not rule. The issue is put to a vote, with the so-called "Utopia Program" favored by the majority of the Squadron; Nighthawk, unable to agree with the decision in clear conscience, resigns from the team. The Squadron assume overall control of the government of the [[United States]] and remake the nation into a virtual utopia. The team implement a series of sweeping changes, including revealing their secret identities; instituting a program of [[behavior modification]] in prisons where inmates are forced to submit to a process that mentally inhibits their criminal instincts; enforcing a strict gun control policy; and developing medical technology to cryogenically preserve the dead.{{issue|date=June 2019}}

Despite the economic and technological advances, there are setbacks: the [[Golden Archer]] abuses the behavior modification technology by forcing fellow member [[Lady Lark]] to love him,{{issue|date=September 2020}} resulting in his eventual removal from the team;{{issue|date=September 2020}}The [[Amphibian (comics)|Amphibian]] becomes increasingly disgusted with the Squadron's methods and abandons the surface world altogether;{{issue|date=September 2020}} [[Nuke (Squadron Supreme)|Nuke]] inadvertently kills his parents via unnoticed and uncontrollable release of radiation and dies while battling Doctor Spectrum during a rampage;{{issue|date=September 2020}} and [[Tom Thumb (comics)|Tom Thumb]] discovers he has [[cancer]] but chooses not to inform his teammates, eventually succumbing to the disease.{{issue|date=June 2019}}

At one point, the team is attacked by the Institute of Evil.{{issue|date=September 2020}} The Squadron ultimately defeats the Institute and uses the behavior modification technology to reform them, adding the former supervillains as members.{{issue|date=September 2020}} Three of them die or are incapacitated.{{issue|date=September 2020}} In the meantime, Nighthawk forms a new team he calls the America Redeemers, recruiting former villains and several previously unknown superhumans.{{issue|date=September 2020}} The later infiltrate the Squadron and kidnap the surviving Institute members to reverse the behavior modification on them.{{issue|date=September 2020}} Despite mixed feelings on the parts of several of the Institute members, they too join the Redeemers.{{issue|date=September 2020}} Former Squadron member the Golden Archer (now known as the Black Archer) also joins.{{issue|date=September 2020}} Eventually, the Redeemers confront the Squadron Supreme. A brutal battle ensues in which several members of both teams are killed, including Nighthawk. A horrified Hyperion realizes that Nighthawk was right: the Squadron, despite having good intentions, had inadvertently created a totalitarian state with themselves as its dictators. The Squadron surrenders, disbands and returns control of the United States to the government.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In a [[graphic novel]] sequel by Gruenwald, Ryan and [[inker]] [[Al Williamson]], ''Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe'', remnants of the team reunite to battle the [[Nth Man]]. Although they succeed, several members of the Squadron are killed, with the remainder (Hyperion, [[Doctor Spectrum#Joseph Ledger (Earth-712)|Doctor Spectrum]], the [[Whizzer (Stanley Stewart)|Whizzer]], [[Power Princess]], [[Lady Lark]] (now known as Skylark), [[Arcanna]], [[Haywire (comics)|Haywire]], and the [[Shape (comics)|Shape]]) [[Marooning|marooned]] in the mainstream Marvel universe.<ref>''Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe'' (1989).

=== Earth-31916 version ===
==== ''Supreme Power'' ====
The series ''Supreme Power'' features the [[reboot (fiction)|rebooted]] version of the [[superhero]] team Squadron Supreme and is set on '''Earth-31916'''.<ref>''Supreme Power'' #1–18 (Jan. 2003–Oct. 2005)</ref> Alien [[Hyperion (Supreme Power)|Hyperion]] arrives on Earth as an infant, and is taken into custody by the [[US government]] and raised in a controlled environment. Army [[Corporal]] Joseph Ledger is given a strange crystal removed from Hyperion's spaceship by the government that bonds to him, causing him to fall into a [[coma]] for years.

Discovering Hyperion has superhuman abilities, the government uses him as a secret weapon, and is eventually outed by the [[News media|media]]. The government then announces and introduces Hyperion as a state-sponsored hero, which encourages other beings to appear, such as the [[The Atlanta Blur|Blur]], who can move at superspeed. Ledger awakens and, harnessing the energy powers of the crystal, becomes [[Doctor Spectrum#Joseph Ledger (Earth-31916)|Doctor Spectrum]]. Hyperion and Spectrum are initially hostile to one another and they battle, with Hyperion accessing lost memories when coming in contact with Spectrum's crystal. The [[Amphibian (comics)|Amphibian]] is seen on dry land for the first time, and [[Power Princess|Princess Zarda]] heals Hyperion after his battle. [[Nighthawk (Supreme Power)|Nighthawk]] solicits the aid of Hyperion and the Blur to deal with a superpowered [[serial killer]], who Hyperion now knows is actually the product of experimentation with his [[DNA]]. Although successful, Hyperion is outraged by the government exploitation and leaves, warning that he has no wish to be contacted by humankind again. The government gathers the remaining superhumans into a team to capture Hyperion.

The story continues in the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''Supreme Power: Hyperion''<ref>''Supreme Power: Hyperion'' #1–5 (Nov. 2005–March 2006)</ref> with new Squadron members [[Master Menace|Emil Burbank]], [[Arcanna]], the [[Shape (comics)|Shape]] and [[Nuke (Squadron Supreme)|Nuke]] tracking Hyperion to what they believe is an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]]. In this world, Hyperion and a version of the Squadron rule the world, with only Nighthawk and a small group of superhumans opposing their rule. Although the heroes locate the true Hyperion and convince him to return to their world, Burbank discovers that it was, in fact, not an alternate reality but their world two years from the present time.

==== Second ''Squadron Supreme'' title ====
The second volume of the series ''Squadron Supreme''<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' vol. 2 #1–7 (May–Nov. 2006)</ref> brings together all the superhumans (except a reluctant Nighthawk), who are split into two teams – one for international/public missions and another for covert operations. The [[President of the United States]] calls the group the Squadron Supreme. The Squadron meets with mixed success: an attempt to kill an [[Africa]]n [[dictator]] is botched, and the target is murdered by local superhumans who state the group is not welcome in Africa, and a mission to [[Iran]] has member [[Inertia (comics)|Inertia]] encouraging a victim to fight back and kill. [[China]] recruits [[Redstone (comics)|Redstone]], the superpowered serial killer created from Hyperion's DNA, in a bid to protect itself. The final issue is a battle to the death against Redstone (with the Blur recruiting Nighthawk to assist) who threatens to [[detonate]] a [[nuclear weapon]]. The outcome is not revealed, as the series concluded with issue #7.

==== ''Ultimate Power'' ====
An unrelated nine-issue series, ''[[Ultimate Power]]'', written by J. Michael Straczynski; [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[Jeph Loeb]] with art by [[Greg Land]],<ref>''Ultimate Power'' #1–3 (Dec. 2006–Feb. 2007); 4–5 (June–July 2007); 6–7 (Sept.–Oct. 2007); 8 (Dec. 2007) and 9 (Feb. 2008)</ref> features the Squadron in a [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] into the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]]. Courtesy of a deception engineered by [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] and the Ultimate villain [[Doctor Doom]], the Squadron travel to the Ultimate Universe, thinking that the Ultimate [[Reed Richards]] is responsible for releasing an organism that has destroyed much of the United States. A series of misunderstandings ensues, and after a series of battles between the Squadron, the [[Ultimate Fantastic Four]], the [[Ultimates]] and the [[Earth-712]] Squadron Supreme (whose world was also affected by the organism), the third culprit is revealed as Burbank, who was asked by the government to develop a weapon to kill Hyperion. Nick Fury is detained in custody in the Earth-31916 universe, while Squadron member Power Princess remains in the Ultimate Universe to ensure that Doom (who escaped custody by using a [[Doombot]]) is captured.

==== ''Squadron Supreme: Hyperion vs. Nighthawk'' ====
An unrelated four-issue limited series, ''Squadron Supreme: Hyperion vs. Nighthawk'', written by [[Marc Guggenheim]] and with art by [[Paul Gulacy]], relates how Hyperion and Nighthawk, after an initial skirmish, join forces to try and alleviate the [[Darfur conflict]] in war-torn [[Sudan]]. Hyperion discovers Nighthawk has a [[prototype]] weapon built from stolen plans of Emil Burbank's journal that cannot actually injure him, but can convince him that he is being injured.<ref>''Squadron Supreme: Hyperion vs. Nighthawk'' #1–4 (March–June 2007)</ref>

==== Third ''Squadron Supreme'' title ====
A third volume of the title ''Squadron Supreme'', written by [[Howard Chaykin]] and with art by [[Greg Land]] (and other artists), is published,<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' vol. 3 #1–12 (Sept. 2008–July 2009)</ref> with the 12-issue series being set five years after the battle with Redstone. Most of the Squadron have disappeared, with Ultimate Nick Fury, Burbank and Arcanna now a team of intelligence officers working for the government and investigating a group of returning astronauts that exhibit strange abilities. The astronauts [[infect]] many people they come into contact with, also giving them superhuman abilities. Fury eventually leads a new version of the Squadron that features characters who are [[pastiche]]s of long-time Marvel characters. The group eventually come into conflict with many of the original members of the Squadron who have been gathered by Hyperion. The heroes unite to stop a group of superhuman [[terrorist]]s from the [[Middle East]], but then, via a government device, apparently all lose their abilities. Arcanna secretly reveals to Fury that she, and likely many others, still possesses superhuman abilities. Fury later returns to the Ultimate Universe.

==== Later appearances ====
Later, the members of the Squadron Supreme are apparently killed by [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] and the [[Cabal (comics)|Cabal]] after the villains raid the Squadron's universe.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 3 #24</ref> Versions resembling these characters later appear on the [[Battleworld]] created by Doctor Doom during the ''[[Secret Wars]]'' event, only to be killed again at the hands of the [[Squadron Sinister]]. Nighthawk is left as the group's only survivor.<ref>''Squadron Sinister'' #1</ref>

=== Earth-616 version ===
This team, set in Marvel's mainstream reality, features characters from numerous alternate universes, such as the Nighthawk from ''Supreme Power'', a Hyperion from a reality that had been destroyed upon colliding with another universe, Doctor Spectrum from the world of the Great Society (which was destroyed by [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] to prevent it from colliding with the mainstream universe), the [[DP 7|Blur]] from the [[New Universe]], and [[Power Princess#Other versions|Warrior Woman]] from a [[Squadron Sinister#Secret Wars (2015)|''Secret Wars'' tie-in]] (posing as the Earth-712 Squadron Supreme's Power Princess).<ref>{{cite web |last1=White |first1=Brett |title=Marvel Announces "Squadron Supreme" From Robinson, Kirk |url=https://www.cbr.com/marvel-announces-squadron-supreme-from-robinson-kirk/ |website=[[Comic Book Resources]] |access-date=March 16, 2019 |date=June 24, 2015}}</ref><ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 6) #0. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Squadron Supreme's first action was to get revenge on Namor for what happened to the worlds of some of its members. They attacked Atlantis where Hyperion beheaded Namor and Zarda killed Attuma. The fight ended with Hyperion lifting Atlantis above the ocean and throwing it onto the ground hard enough to kill the remaining Atlanteans present.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' vol. 4 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> The actions caused by the Squadron Supreme led the [[Uncanny Avengers|Avengers Unity Division]] to apprehend them before anyone else ends up killed by their hand.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' vol. 4 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Squadron Supreme were saved by [[Thundra]] and later teleported to [[Weirdworld]],<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' vol. 4 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> where they encounter [[Doctor Druid]], who plans to mind-control Weirdworld's inhabitants.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' vol. 4 #4</ref> The Squadron Supreme shatter the crystal that Druid was using to enhance his mind control powers and return home. Power Princess remains on Weirdworld and reveals herself as Warrior Woman. Thundra sides with the Squadron Supreme, although she is unsure if she should help the Squadron Supreme protect the world or help protect the world from the Squadron Supreme.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' vol. 4 #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Through Modred the Mystic's magical modifications to Reed Richard's time machine, Hyperion and Doctor Spectrum are accidentally transformed into ephemeral "ghosts" caught in the past; specifically during the Squadron's attack on Atlantis and just before Hyperion kills Namor. They decide to change the past by dragging this past Namor back to the present, thereby resurrecting him. Although this action is easy for Hyperion, who has had second thoughts about the cutthroat methods the Squadron Supreme has been using, it is more difficult for Doctor Spectrum, as Namor destroyed her Earth. At the end of the story arc, Hyperion leads the action to disband the Squadron, and the team goes their separate ways.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' vol. 4 #13–15. Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== Squadron Supreme of America ===
When the Avengers become a global peacekeeping force, [[Thunderbolt Ross]] meets with [[Phil Coulson]] to discuss the matter. Phil reveals that he has established the Squadron Supreme of America as the newest United States superhero team. The team consists of Hyperion, Power Princess, Nighthawk, the Blur, and Doctor Spectrum as their leader.<ref>''The Avengers'' #700. Marvel Comics.</ref> With Doctor Spectrum as their leader, the Squadron Supreme of America were first used to fight Namor and his Defenders of the Deep when they attacked a Roxxon oil rig that is off the coast of Alaska.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 8 #10. Marvel Comics.</ref> Then the Squadron Supreme visited another oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico, where Doctor Spectrum used his powers to melt areas of the oil rig to secure it from an attack by Namor. The Squadron Supreme then made short work of Namor and the Defenders of the Deep.<ref>''Free Comic Book Day 2019  Avengers.'' Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the ''[[The War of the Realms|War of the Realms]]'' storyline, the Squadron Supreme of America were summoned to Washington D.C. by Phil Coulson, who brought them up to speed on [[Malekith the Accursed|Malekith]]'s invasion. They are shown fighting [[Trolls (Marvel Comics)|Rock Trolls]] and [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Frost Giants]]. Their origin is fully shown where its members are revealed to be [[simulacrum]]s created by [[Mephisto (Marvel Comics)|Mephisto]] and programmed by the Power Elite so that Phil Coulson can have them be a United States-sponsored superhero team. After the Squadron Supreme caused the Frost Giants to retreat, Phil Coulson sends them to Ohio which has become a battleground.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 8 #18. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Squadron Supreme are summoned to confront Black Panther when he infiltrates the Pentagon and confronts Phil Coulson. Hyperion states that the Squadron Supreme are the United States' sanctioned superhero team in light of the Avengers becoming an anti-American team. As Nighthawk states to Blur that the Black Panther will not run as he is under arrest, the Black Panther states to them that he does not know how they got their powers and that they are not the Squadron Supreme, as he even asked if they trust Phil Coulson. Before they can grab him, the Black Panther contacts [[Broo (comics)|Broo]] to teleport him away. As he disappears, the Black Panther states that Phil Coulson will not answer their questions and that the Avengers are not their enemies unless they force them to be.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 8 #21. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the ''[[Heroes Reborn (2021 comic)|Heroes Reborn]]'' storyline, reality has been somehow changed so that the Squadron Supreme of America are the main superhero team and that the Avengers never existed. The Squadron Supreme are seen fighting the [[Masters of Evil|Masters of Doom]] consisting of [[Doctor Juggernaut]], [[Black Skull (comics)|Black Skull]], [[Silver Witch]] and [[All-Gog]] after their escape from the [[Negative Zone]]. The Squadron Supreme manages to repel the Masters of Doom with the fight being witnessed by President Phil Coulson.<ref>''Heroes Reborn'' vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Skrullian Skymaster was shown to be a member of this reality's Squadron Supreme before he was killed by [[Rogue (Marvel Comics)|Rogue]] to avenge [[Mystique (character)|Mystique]]'s death.<ref>''Heroes Reborn: Magneto & the Mutant Force'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Nighthawk and Blur had a Secret Squadron team that consisted of Tom Thumb (who is an amalgam of both versions), Amphibian, Blue Eagle, Golden Archer, and Arcanna Jones. This group fought the Siege Society in London where Amphibian was beheaded by Baron Helmut Zemo, Golden Archer was killed by Hawkeye and Fire-Ant, Tom Thumb was subdued by Hawkeye, Arcanna Jones was killed by Silver Witch, and Golden Eagle was slain offscreen by Black Widow and Hawkeye who escape with Fire Ant using his special wings. Following the fight, Nighthawk, Blur, and Tom Thumb mourn their comrades at their funeral.<ref>''Heroes Reborn: Siege Society'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Squadron Supreme of America discuss their encounters with various heroes and concerns about their world being wrong. Putting aside their differences and without telling President Coulson, they gather clues and rule out suspects before eventually arriving in Wakanda, where they confront the Avengers.<ref>''Heroes Reborn'' Vol. 2 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Avengers battle and eventually defeat the Squadron Supreme of America. After Captain America, Star Brand, and Echo use the Pandemonium Cube to restore the original reality, the Squadron Supreme of America find their memories transferred to their counterparts in the Avengers' reality and struggle to find their place in an unfamiliar world.<ref>''Heroes Return'' #1.

==Fictional character biography==
Dmitri Smerdyakov was born in [[Soviet Union|Soviet Russia]]. In his youth, he became a servant and half-brother to [[Kraven the Hunter|Sergei Kravinoff]], and later a minor associate of [[Gentleman (character)|Gustav Fiers]]. Although Dmitri and Sergei were friends, Sergei was often abusive to Smerdyakov, leading to a combination of admiration and resentment towards Kravinoff. Eventually, Smerdyakov emigrated to the [[United States|United States of America]]. As he had made a talent for himself during his youth by impressing his brother by impersonating friends and neighbors, he assumed an even more impressive disguise: the identity of Chameleon. During his first known criminal outing, he impersonated Spider-Man, though he was soon exposed and arrested. Shortly afterward, Sergei (now known as "Kraven the Hunter") came to America, and the Chameleon set his old associate's sights on [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Both men became long-time enemies of Spider-Man, part of his primary [[List of Spider-Man enemies|rogues' gallery]].

The Chameleon inspired Kraven to begin hunting Spider-Man, inviting Kraven to dispose of the hero.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #15. Marvel Comics.</ref> With Kraven, the Chameleon battled [[Iron Man]],<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #58. Marvel Comics.</ref> and then confronted the [[Hulk]].<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #66</ref> At one point, the Chameleon disguised himself as [[Hank Pym]], and robbed Pym's laboratory for documents to combat Virus Nine. While delivering the documents and a shrunken Hulk to [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]], he was encountered and defeated by Ant-Man.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #154. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Chameleon disguised himself as the [[Torpedo (Marvel Comics)#Brock Jones|Torpedo]] and battled [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #134. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When his half-brother committed suicide,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #294. Marvel Comics.</ref> the Chameleon became obsessed with making Spider-Man suffer for his failure to prevent this. He ingested a serum which made his face permanently featureless and malleable. He attempted to kidnap America's leading expert on superconductors, but was thwarted by Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #307. Marvel Comics.</ref> He then kidnapped [[J. Jonah Jameson]]. He approached the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] for support to be New York's new crime lord, and formed an alliance with [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]].<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #50-55. Marvel Comics.</ref> Disguised as a scientist, the Chameleon temporarily removed Spider-Man's powers. He allied himself with the [[Femme Fatales (comics)|Femme Fatales]], the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]], and the [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)#Luis Alvarez|Tarantula]] to eliminate Spider-Man and the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], but escaped when his plan failed.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #340-343. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Chameleon's most ambitious play against Spider-Man happened when he formed an alliance with [[Harry Osborn]] as the Green Goblin. Before Harry's death, the Chameleon was told Spider-Man's secret identity could be found through Peter Parker, to construct androids of Peter's parents; the Chameleon later admitted that he went through with the plot to confirm once and for all that Peter was Spider-Man. The plan led to a psychotic breakdown for both Spider-Man and the Chameleon, Spider-Man briefly renouncing the civilian identity while the Chameleon is sent to Ravencroft Asylum.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #389. Marvel Comics.</ref> But when Doctor [[Ashley Kafka]] sneaks him into a basement to try to continue treating him in the belief that he was close to a breakthrough when the court were preparing to put him on trial, the Chameleon escaped and attempted to convince Spider-Man of actually a hallucinating writer who had suffered a mental breakdown after his daughter's death in a car accident but Peter managed to break through this deception due to his own strength of will.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #242. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Chameleon's confirmation of Spider-Man's secret identity led him to try to attack Spider-Man through family and friends but this effort met with rather dismal results when [[Mary Jane Watson]] subdued him with a baseball bat.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #244. Marvel Comics.</ref> Somewhere in between this and subsequent appearances, he appeared to have been destroyed by his nephew [[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kravinoff]]; Alyosha later threw a Chameleon mask at Spider-Man's feet, referring to it as 'That weakling Dmitri' but apparently recovered, waking in a hospital.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #245. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After tricking Spider-Man to the bridge where [[Gwen Stacy]]'s death occurred, on the pretext of having kidnapped Mary Jane, he declared his own loneliness and love for Peter. When Peter laughed, he threw himself off the bridge.<ref>''Webspinners: Tales of Spider-Man'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> He reappeared some time later in a [[mental institution]], completely incapacitated, believing himself to be Sergei Kravinoff rather than his true self.<ref>''Spider-Man: Get Kraven'' #2-6. Marvel Comics.</ref> He later reappeared in his Chameleon identity as part of the [[Sinister Twelve]] villain team organized by [[Norman Osborn]] as the Green Goblin.<ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After Spider-Man was unmasked, the Chameleon gathered a gang of villains called the Exterminators,<ref name="marvunapp.com" /> including [[Will O' The Wisp (comics)|Will O' The Wisp]], [[Scarecrow (Marvel Comics)|Scarecrow]], [[Swarm (comics)|Swarm]] and [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], and also blackmailed the [[Molten Man]] into his employ all in an effort to defeat Spider-Man and attack the web-slinger's family.<ref>''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #29. Marvel Comics.</ref>

However, the Chameleon was dealt a most humiliating defeat by [[Aunt May|May Parker]]'s hands, when he attempted to trick May into believing he was Peter, then murder May. But May was not fooled by any means, and defeated the villain with a plate of oatmeal-raisin cookies laced with [[Ambien]]. The [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] was also employed as part of the team up and later defeated Spider-Man only to be unable to collect payment from the Chameleon as he was already captured.<ref>''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #31-#33. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After the "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]", the Chameleon showed up among the villains at [[Stilt-Man]]'s funeral at the Bar with No Name where the [[Punisher]] poisoned the drinks and blew up the bar.<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Chameleon next appeared in the newest incarnation of ''Super Villain Team-Up'' called [[MODOK]]'s Eleven. In this limited series, it is revealed that he contacted [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] the moment he was telepathically summoned by MODOK. He then allowed A.I.M. to send in their newest creation, the [[Super-Adaptoid|Ultra-Adaptoid]], under the guise of the Chameleon.<ref>''Super Villain Team-Up: MODOK's Eleven'' #1-2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Additionally, it was revealed in ''Super Villain Team-Up: MODOK's Eleven'' that his apparent insanity and demise years earlier were in fact well-crafted ruses designed so that he could fade into the background once more.<ref>''Super Villain Team-Up: MODOK's Eleven'' #3-5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The "[[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]]" storyline ended with the removal of Peter and Mary Jane's timeline from all memories and no one knows Spider-Man's identity, including the Chameleon.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #545. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Chameleon returns to New York more sadistic and sociopathic than ever before. To complete his hired goal of bombing City Hall, he kidnaps Peter who works for Mayor J. Jonah Jameson. While posing as Parker, he tries to better his life, revealing that he always tries to rectify the problems in the lives of his "faces".<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #602. Marvel Comics.</ref> Using Peter's security clearance to get access to various materials, the Chameleon was poised to bomb City Hall before Peter escaped and thwarted his plans as Spider-Man. During the resulting confusion, the Chameleon escaped.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #603. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Sometime later at an alley building during "[[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt]]" storyline, the distraught Chameleon is met by Sasha Kravinoff and [[Kraven the Hunter (Ana Kravinoff)|Ana Kravinoff]] who want his help in avenging Sergei's death.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #604. Marvel Comics.</ref> Various follow up issues during ''[[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt|The Gauntlet]]'' storyline show the Chameleon helping the Kravinoff family into creating an alliance of Spider-Man's enemies as well as [[Diablo (Marvel Comics)|Diablo]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #607. Marvel Comics.</ref> First, he and Sasha managed to spring Electro from prison.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #614. Marvel Comics.</ref> Then Chameleon approached [[Mysterio]] stating that he has friends that are "dying" to meet him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #620. Marvel Comics.</ref> When it came to the ''Grim Hunt'' part, he posed as [[Ezekiel (comics)|Ezekiel]] in order to get close to Spider-Man to defeat and bring to the Kravinoffs in order to sacrifice as part of a ritual that will revive Sergei.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #635. Marvel Comics.</ref> After Sergei is resurrected, the Chameleon states that the problem might stem from inward anger of being resurrected. He and the Kravinoffs discover Spider-Man's corpse, which turns out to be [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]] in Spider-Man's costume instead.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #636. Marvel Comics.</ref> The real Spider-Man goes to take revenge on the Kravenoff family. Spider-Man soon arrives and pulled the Chameleon and Alyosha into the huge nest of spiders. Sasha realizes that the Kravinoff family wasn't hunting the spiders, but it was the spiders hunting them.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #637. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "Origin of the Species" storyline, the Chameleon is invited by [[Doctor Octopus]] to join his supervillain team where he gets involved in securing some specific items for Doctor Octopus. He poses as Harry Osborn to trick Spider-Man by telling him that [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Menace]]'s infant has died. When Spider-Man has been away, the Chameleon got the infant.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #644. Marvel Comics.</ref> Doctor Octopus later talks with the Chameleon saying that the baby is the first of a new species. Using a lead gained when he took down [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], Spider-Man arrives at the Kravinoff Mansion where he captures the Chameleon who reveals that the baby is still alive and is in the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]]'s clutches.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #645. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Chameleon later becomes a member of Doctor Octopus's latest incarnation of the Sinister Six. He poses as Captain [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] in order to infiltrate an Air Force base.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #648. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Chameleon disguises himself as a tribal chief when he and Mysterio pull off a zombie pirate attack on some natives.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #659. Marvel Comics.</ref> Using robots of the other Sinister Six members, Chameleon and Mysterio pulled off this scheme as a diversion so that Doctor Octopus and the other Sinister Six members can infiltrate the Baxter Building to look for specific technology plans while the [[Future Foundation]] were investigating the more obvious threat.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #660. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Chameleon later poses as [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]] in order to infiltrate Intelligencia so that he can help the Sinister Six steal their Zero Cannon.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #676. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Ends of the Earth (Marvel Comics)|Ends of the Earth]]" storyline, the Chameleon was present with the Sinister Six when Doctor Octopus tells them about a master plan.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #682. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Chameleon was present at [[Palazzo Senatorio]] at a summit where the world's greatest minds and the world leaders is carried out to discuss about Doctor Octopus's supposed offer to save the world with the Chameleon disguised as [[Al Gore]]. As Al Gore, the Chameleon states that Doctor Octopus would save them. Without a counter-argument, Spider-Man punches Al Gore and reveals to everyone present that Al Gore is actually the Chameleon in disguise. Spider-Man's new costume could detect which person is actually the Chameleon based on heartbeats. A transmission from Doctor Octopus states activating the Octavian Lens which are blocking the harmful UV rays from the sun in order to reinforce this offer. After letting the Chameleon go, Spider-Man secretly places a Spider-Tracer on the Chameleon so that the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] could follow him. They follow the Chameleon to the Mediterranean Coasts where the Sinister Six is waiting for the Chameleon. Using many of the stolen objects, the Sinister Six successfully subdue the Avengers leaving only Spider-Man standing.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #683. Marvel Comics.</ref> After Spider-Man and the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] escape with [[Silver Sable]]'s help, the Chameleon suggest that since the Sinister Six's remaining members had each received their $2 billion and their criminal records expunged, they should just leave Doctor Octopus and his scheme. But they stay on board as that would make an enemy out of Doctor Octopus. The Chameleon later gets involved with Mysterio in tricking Spider-Man's allies into thinking they were destroying Symkaria, in order to give Doctor Octopus more time to complete the 200 satellites. However, the Chameleon is captured and the Black Widow threatens to reveal the secret behind his real face.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #686. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Following the "[[Dying Wish]]" storyline, the Chameleon later fights [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] (Otto Octavius's mind in Spider-Man's body) and the [[Secret Avengers]] on the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[Helicarrier]].<ref>''Avenging Spider-Man'' #20. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Chameleon ends up knocked unconscious and the Superior Spider-Man transports him to his hidden underwater lab where he ends up imprisoned.<ref>''Avenging Spider-Man'' #21. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Chameleon, Electro, [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], [[Mysterio#Mysterion|Mysterion]], and the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] are later seen as part of the "Superior Six" team. The Superior Spider-Man has been temporarily controlling their minds in order to redeem them for their crimes, doing this by forcing them do heroic deeds against their will which almost get some of them killed. Every time they are done being controlled, they are put back in their containment cells.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> They eventually break free of the Superior Spider-Man's control and attempt to exact revenge, while nearly destroying New York in order to do so.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> With Sun Girl's help, the Superior Spider-Man is barely able to stop the Superior Six.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Following the true Spider-Man's return, the Chameleon attempts to drive Spider-Man insane as revenge for the Superior Spider-Man's earlier treatment of him. However, [[Deadpool]] switches costumes with Spider-Man, with the Chameleon unaware of this. He fails at driving Deadpool insane (as Deadpool is already insane), and ends up being shot in the leg by him. Both heroes (in each other's costumes) punch the Chameleon at the same time, knocking him out and later delivered him to the authorities.<ref>''Deadpool Annual'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

At the conclusion of the "[[Hunted (comics)|Hunted]]" storyline, the Chameleon is revealed to be one of the attendees at Sergei's funeral as he is pleased that Sergei spared him from the Great Hunt. As he walks away, the Chameleon quotes to his dead stepbrother to sleep well and states "You needn't worry. The world is no longer your burden. Besides, there won't be much of it left soon... Not by the time I've finished."<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #23. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "Chameleon Conspiracy" storyline, Chameleon was imprisoned in a Symkarian black site prison called the Hiding Place when [[Teresa Parker]] infiltrated it so that she can interrogate him about his connection with Harry Osborn and the use of the Life Model Decoys of her parents. While stating that she IS a Parker, Teresa dragged Chameleon to another cell which is holding her parents' killer Finisher who is still alive after his apparent death at the hands of Spider-Man. Chameleon claimed that he has the answers she needs.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #67. Marvel Comics.</ref> Teresa did a non-fatal shot to Finisher as she still needs answers from him as Chameleon assured.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #68. Marvel Comics.</ref> Chameleon and Finisher admitted to Teresa that Chameleon faked Finisher's death to fool Spider-Man. Upon them relocating to another building, Finisher is shown to have a plethora of people resembling Chameleon which made Chameleon feel uncomfortable.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #69. Marvel Comics.</ref> As Spider-Man finds that some of the Jack O'Lanterns were unmasked to be Chameleon-resembling people, Finisher revealed to Teresa that Chameleon was adopted at a young age by Gustav Fiers. Then Chameleon revealed that they never left the Hiding Place and that Finisher was using holographic technology to speak with Teresa as Chameleon states that she can use the Clairvoyant to find the rest of the answers she needs. Upon meeting up with Spider-Man, he wanted her to use the Clairvoyant as Teresa has a flashback to Chameleon's claim that she is a Chameleon double agent. Not wanting confirmation on this, Teresa breaks the Clairvoyant and states that she IS a Parker while planning to track down Finisher. Back in his cell while reading a [[Leo Tolstoy]] book, Chameleon is approached by [[Kindred (Marvel Comics)|Kindred]] who wants some more serum while also stating that he can see his true face. Chameleon states that he is happy to do business with Osborn again.<ref>''Giant-Size Amazing Spider-Man: Chameleon Conspiracy'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Originally, the Chameleon had no superhuman powers and simply used makeup and elaborate costuming to impersonate his targets. In order to do this, he implemented a device in a belt buckle that emitted a gas that helped him mold his features. Later, the Chameleon obtained a microcomputer from [[Spencer Smythe]] for his belt buckle that could be programmed with the facial features of hundreds of people.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #186. Marvel Comics.</ref> The belt buckle also contains a video receiver that enables the computer to analyze the appearance of anyone the Chameleon encounters so that it can duplicate his/her features using electrical impulses. The computer utilizes [[hologram|holographic]] technology that allowed him to change his appearance at the push of a button. His electronic devices allowed him to appear as two different people to two separate observers simultaneously. The Chameleon's costume consists of "memory material" that can be altered by electrical impulses from his belt so as to resemble the clothing of the person he is impersonating.

Later, the Chameleon's powers are made innate: his skin pigmentation have been surgically and [[mutagen]]ically altered by a serum so that he can take on the appearance of any person at will.{{issue|date=May 2012}} He also wears fabric made of memory material that responds to nerve impulses and can appear to be whatever costume he wishes to be.

When his past friendship with Kraven the Hunter was revealed, it was also revealed that the Chameleon had taken the same serums that Kraven had taken over the years.{{issue|date=May 2012}} This would suggest that the two characters were of a similar age (over 70 years old). It would also suggest that the Chameleon's physical strength and endurance could be somewhat augmented, but as the Chameleon's strength is much lower than that of Kraven, his augmentations may not reach a [[superhuman]] level.

Aside from his physical advantages, the Chameleon is a master of disguise, and a brilliant [[method acting|method actor]] and impressionist. He is also a master of creating lifelike masks and make-up. He is a quick-change artist who can assume a new disguise in less than a minute, although he no longer needs to use such skills. He also speaks several languages fluently. Although the Chameleon is not a scientific genius, during his increased lifespan he has been exposed to a wide array of sophisticated experimental technology, much of which he can apply effectively in his nefarious schemes.

In his 2010 appearances in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'', writer [[Fred Van Lente]] placed a stronger emphasis on his skills of disguise rather than his superhuman powers. In this portrayal, Chameleon kidnaps people and brutally kills them by dumping them in an acid bath. From listening to them beg for their lives, he alters his pitch to sound exactly alike and takes a face print to make into a mask. This more chilling Chameleon also seeks to fix the lives of his "faces", attempting to rectify the problems of their lives while he poses as them as a part of some warped heroic view of himself.{{issue|date=May 2012}}

==Other versions==
===Chameleon 2099===
In [[Marvel 2099]], a [[designer drug]] that causes its users to involuntarily shapeshift in response to whatever emotion they are feeling at the time is nicknamed "Chameleon". After fighting an addict (who turned into a bull-like monster when angered and a mouse-like creature when frightened) at [[Woodstock]] 2099, [[Spider-Man 2099|the era's Spider-Man]] tracks down the distributor of the Chameleon, a [[hippy]] known as Major Jones. While battling Jones and his minions, Spider-Man accidentally knocks the dealer into his supply of the drug, causing him to mutate into an amorphous blob and consequently the new Chameleon.<ref>''2099 Unlimited'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Chameleon 2211===
A version of Chameleon appeared in ''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man''. He has the powers of physically changing into any shape or form after accessing their [[DNA]]. This usually involves sampling their blood after killing the subject, although less lethal methods are possible; he was able to change into [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] after an accidental ingestion of some of his sand.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Chameleon encounters an alternate Uncle Ben from another future who has been transferred into the 'main' timelined by [[Hobgoblin (comics)#Hobgoblin 2211|Hobgoblin]] of 2211, attempting to influence Ben to kill [[Edwin Jarvis]] for his current involvement with this timeline's [[May Parker]] by arguing that, since the multiverse means every action possible is being committed, you might as well do what feels good. When Ben rejects the suggestion, Chameleon kills and replaces him. This fools [[Spider-Man 2211]] whom he then kills when he arrives to try to return 'Ben' to his reality. After discovering the body, Sandman's father was framed for Ben's murder, and Sandman went to Spider-Man for help.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

The two encountered Chameleon at Peter's high school (Chameleon had murdered the principal and was posing as him), where Chameleon reveals that he wasn't human at all but a giant monster. Chameleon was finally defeated, however, after Spider-Man (of Earth 616) used Spider-Man 2211's helmet to literally "administer poetic justice", causing a last-minute body switch between Chameleon and Sandman's father into an electric chair.<ref>''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #19. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Counter-Earth===
Spider-Man faces the [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]] version of The Chameleon in ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited (comics)|Spider-Man Unlimited]]'' #5. This Chameleon, a reptilian [[New Men (Marvel Comics)|Bestial]], is a depraved serial killer who both Spider-Man and a bestial [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] team-up to defeat.<ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited'' #5.</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Dmitri Smerdyakov is alluded on a list of cat burglars in the ''Daily Bugle'' database.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #53. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Ultimate version of Chameleon are two unnamed twin siblings with the ability to shape-shift. One poses first as [[J. Jonah Jameson]],<ref name="ReferenceA">''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> and later [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Man]], while the other (referred to as "Camellia") keeps the real Jameson and Peter Parker restrained.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The Chameleon twins are defeated by [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]] and [[Iceman (comics)|Bobby Drake]], and imprisoned in the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]].<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Marvel Action Hour: Iron Man===
In ''[[Iron Man (TV series)|Iron Man]]'' during [[The Marvel Action Hour]], the Chameleon appeared in #4 of the cartoon based comic in service to [[Justin Hammer]]. He used his transformation abilities to obtain the Grim Reaper weapon from Stark Enterprises.

===Marvel Noir===
The [[Marvel Noir]] version of Dmitri Smerdyakov (a.k.a. The Chameleon) has the ability to alter his features to imitate any individual, although this ability stems from his clay-like malleable features rather than his mainstream counterpart's technological advantages. He is a former Coney Island freak working for mob boss [[Norman Osborn]] (a.k.a. "The Goblin") by impersonating J. Jonah Jameson in order to eliminate [[Ben Urich]] and set a trap for [[Spider-Man Noir|Spider-Man]]. He is killed by [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Felicia Hardy]] who witnesses him as Jameson killing Ben.<ref>''Spider-Man: Noir'' #1-4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Publication history==
John Jameson debuted in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #1 (March 1963), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].<ref name="Manning18">{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|editor-last = Gilbert|editor-first = Laura|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle: Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 18|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= [''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #1] introduced readers to ''The Daily Bugle'' publisher and anti-Spider-Man activist J. Jonah Jameson, as Spidey saved his astronaut son, John, from a space mission gone awry.}}</ref> This first story introduces the character as a prominent [[astronaut]].

During his lengthy stint on ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' during the 1970s, writer [[Gerry Conway]] had Jameson turned into a [[werewolf]], with the new alias "the Man-Wolf". Conway explained: {{quote|I'd wanted to do something with [John Jameson] for a long time. I felt like he was a character who'd gotten lost over the years. Also, at this point, it's 1973, John Jameson is an astronaut, and [[Apollo 11|we've been to the moon]], so I asked myself, "What would we do with that in Spider-Man's world?" And that was how it played out. It also added another layer of tension to Spider-Man's relationship with J. Jonah Jameson. As a writer, you always want to find a way to increase the pressure on the main character, to increase the involvement of other characters with that character. Consequently, anything that could make Jonah's hatred of Spider-Man more intense and at the same time more understandable was a useful device dramatically.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Williams|first= Scott E.|date= October 2010|title= Gerry Conway: Everything but the Gwen Stacy Sink|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= #44| page= 10|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>}} As the Man-Wolf, Jameson was the lead feature in ''[[Creatures on the Loose]]'' #30-37 (July 1974-September 1975).<ref>Manning "1970s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 75: "Man-Wolf was awarded his own regular spotlight in the ongoing title ''Creatures on the Loose''...Man-Wolf's adventures became the focus of this title until its conclusion with issue #37."</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Born in [[New York City]], John Jonah Jameson III is the son of ''The [[Daily Bugle]]'''s irascible, gruff publisher [[J. Jonah Jameson|John Jonah Jameson Junior]]. Jonah is immensely proud of his son, whom he sees as a true hero. Initially an astronaut, he was first seen being saved by [[Spider-Man]] when his craft malfunctioned on re-entry,<ref name="Manning18" /> something that did nothing to endear the wall-crawler to his father resenting Spider-Man's form of heroism.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #1 (March 1963). Marvel Comics.</ref>

On a later mission, Jameson was infected with spores that gave him superstrength, but strained his body and mind. He was forced to wear a strength-restraining Jupiter suit and battled Spider-Man at his father's urging before recovering and calling himself "Colonel Jupiter". His father convinced him to go after Spider-Man, who had been seen apparently robbing a bank. The web-slinger outsmarted him, and Jonah soon learned that Spider-Man was saving the bank from a bomb. However, Jameson did not care about the misunderstanding and was really out for revenge. Spider-Man managed to neutralize the spores with electricity, returning Jameson to normal.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #41-42 (October–November 1966). Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>Manning "1960s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 37: "Spider-Man tangled with a powered-up John Jameson, driven half-mad by contact with spores encountered on a space walk."</ref>

While he was on the Moon, Jameson found the mystical Godstone, an other-dimensional [[ruby]].<ref name=regrettable>{{cite book |last1=Morris |first1=Jon |title=The League of Regrettable Superheroes: Half Baked Heroes from Comic Book History |date=2015 |publisher=Quirk Books |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |isbn=978-1-59474-763-2 |pages=218–219}}</ref> The jewel grafted itself to his throat (after he made it into a pendant and started wearing it around his neck) and extended tendrils through his body.

Later, he was transported to the dimension known as the Other Realm, from which the ruby originated and which was the source of the radiation from the ruby that transformed Jameson into the Man-Wolf. It was revealed that the ruby was created by the dying Stargod to pass on his powers to someone else. While on Earth, Jameson could only partially transform, resulting in his bestial form,<ref>''[[Tower of Shadows#Creatures on the Loose|Creatures on the Loose]]'' #30-37 (July 1974-September 1975). Marvel Comics.</ref> while in the Other Realm he could fully transform, resulting in retention of his human intelligence and speech while in lupine form.

Jameson became the pilot of [[Captain America]]'s personal [[Quinjet]] for a period, using the call-sign of "Skywolf". During this time, he was temporarily transformed into the Man-Wolf by [[Dredmund the Druid|Dredmond Druid]], who wanted the power of the Stargod for himself. Jameson then left Captain America's employ due to his attraction to [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]] (Captain America's then-girlfriend).<ref>''Captain America'' #402-407. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Jameson remains friends with Spider-Man and often tries to convince his father to "let up on [Spider-Man]". He spent some time as Ravencroft's Head of Security and briefly dated its director, Dr. [[Ashley Kafka]]. The [[Carnage (character)|Carnage]] symbiote briefly overwhelmed Jameson, using him to commit further murders before Carnage eventually bonded with [[Ben Reilly]] (Spider-Man at that time). Both Jameson and Ashley were fired by a director who was angry about the [[Chameleon (Marvel Comics)|Chameleon]]'s escape and subsequent wounding by [[Kraven the Hunter]]. Via hypnotherapy, Kafka helped discover that [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]] had caused him to attack his hospitalized father. This therapy also briefly unleashed Jameson's Man-Wolf form before Ashley was able to help Jameson suppress his changes once more.<ref name="Spider-Carnage">''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #3, ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #410, ''Spider-Man'' #67, and ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #233. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline, Jameson helped Captain America while the latter was in hiding. He was assisting She-Hulk in locating and signing up unregistered superheroes. Jameson had also been registered as the Man-Wolf under the [[Registration acts (comics)|Superhuman Registration Act]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} During this time, the villain [[Stegron|Stegron the Dinosaur Man]] temporarily transformed him into the Man-Wolf again, as a side-effect of a mad scheme to devolve the entire population of New York City. He attacked [[Mary Jane Watson]] and [[Aunt May|May Parker]] in [[Avengers Tower]], but was subdued by [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]'s [[Guardsman (comics)|Guardsmen]] before he could harm them.<ref>''The Sensational Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #25. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Reed Richards]] subsequently cured him of this form.<ref>''The Sensational Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #27. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Jameson had been dating the [[She-Hulk]] (Jennifer Walters) and the two had been living together for some time, along with Augustus Pugliese (the She-Hulk's co-worker).<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2 #5 (2005). Marvel Comics.</ref> Eventually, they [[elope]]d in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]].<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2 #8 (2005).

After a brief rampage, Jameson stopped fighting his situation and became the Stargod again.<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2 #9 (2005). Marvel Comics.</ref> He now retains his intelligence while in the Man-Wolf's form, has the Stargod's powers and apparently can switch between his human and lupine forms at will. His current superhuman status can be defined in his own words as "''I am a god''" and is supported by a battle with a clone of the Mad Titan [[Thanos]] in which he held his own.<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2 #10 (2005). Marvel Comics.</ref> However, Jameson did not want to be the Stargod anymore because he felt that having the powers of a god made him arrogant and savage. The She-Hulk and the Stargod separated after the She-Hulk discovered that her feelings for Jameson were influenced prior to their marriage by [[Starfox (comics)|Starfox]]<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2 #11 (2005). Marvel Comics.</ref> and after she had also learned that Jameson had hoped to convince Jennifer to give up the She-Hulk identity permanently.<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2 #12 (2005).

Marvel Comics.</ref>

When it came to Jameson's next mission into space, [[Alistair Smythe|Alistair Alphonso Smythe]], the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] and the new villain the Fly-Girl attacked the launch site with an army of cyborg minions (each one wanting revenge on his father, J. Jonah Jameson) where the three sabotaged the launch and held Jameson for ransom.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #652</ref> Jameson was saved in the end.{{issue|date=April 2013}}

Soon after, Jameson was attacked on the Apogee 1 Space Station by co-workers who were being mind-controlled by [[Doctor Octopus]], wanting to take control of the station. With the help of Spider-Man and the [[Human Torch]], he was able to save the day and the station safely crashed into the ocean, its employees all alive and well.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #680-681. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Jameson would eventually go to work in the military testing out anti-symbiote weapons technology for the U.S. Armed Forces.<ref>''All-New All-Different Point One'' #1. (Dec. 2015) Marvel Comics.</ref> He would eventually be contacted by Special Agent Clair Dixon in the tasking of apprehending Cletus Kasady; a.k.a. the supervillain known as Carnage. needing his expertise with the governmental developed Sonic Defense System on top of his experience with the alien-hosting serial killer.<ref>''Carnage'' vol. 2 #1-16.

Jameson appeared as a member of the Agents of Wakanda in his Man-Wolf form. He was shown fighting [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]]s in outer space beyond lunar orbit.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 8 #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>  While Jameson was investigating Doverton, he was taken over by Carnage and his cult.<ref>''Cult of Carnage'' (2019).

Jameson eventually threw off Carnage's control and the symbiote was purged from his body.<ref>''Lethal Protectors'' vol. 2 #1-3 (2019). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Traumatized by his actions while mind-controlled, Jameson found it harder to change into the Man-Wolf. He became a security consultant at Ravencroft. During a prison riot that threatened to destroy the facility, Jameson overcame his traumas and regained his Man-Wolf form.<ref>''Ravencroft'' #1-5 (2019). Marvel Comics</ref> When Norman Osborn became Director of Ravencroft, he dismissed Jameson and other staff members who might interfere with Osborn's plans for the facility.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #46 (2018).

Investigating an anomaly on the Moon, the Agents of Wakanda were attacked by Entea, an intelligent plant that had taken root there. Jameson became the Stargod again and the conflict with Entea ended once the Agents of Wakanda realized she was starving due to a lack of sustenance on the Moon. The Stargod opened a portal to the Other Realm for Entea to feed there, only to discover that, in his absence, some unknown disaster has reduced it to a desolate wasteland devoid of life.  Still, Entea was able to use the nutrients in the soil to take root and bring life back to the Other Realm. The other Agents returned to Earth and the Stargod remained in the Other Realm to help Entea settle in and to investigate the disaster, intending to return to Earth once that was completed.<ref>''Black Panther and the Agents of Wakanda'' #3-4 (2019).

==Powers and abilities==
John Jameson is a skilled pilot and astronaut and is experienced in hand-to-hand combat and the use of a variety of weapons. During his space flight to the gas giant planet Jupiter, alien spores found on the planet had attracted to and clung onto John on his return trip home.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #41. (Oct. 1966) Marvel Comics.</ref> These spores changed his anatomical physiology, causing him to enlarge and become physically denser than normal; he also ran the risk of cardiovascular and neurological complications without use of a specially designed weighted suit which monitored his bio-readings. Also, using his powers increased psychological instability, causing him to become increasingly more violent and aggressive whenever his emotions ran away with him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #42. (Nov. 1966) Marvel Comics.</ref>

While Jameson was doing search and rescue missions in the Middle East, the American military discovered that another Godstone had grown within his body, the original having altered his physiology to the point that he now spawns replacement gems.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Gerry Conway|penciller = Mike Perkins|inker = Mike Perkins|colorist = Andy Troy|letterer = VC's Joe Sabino|editor = Nick Lowe|story = The One That Got Away, Part Three|title = Carnage|volume = 2|issue = #3|date = 30 December 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> When the new Godstone is ripped out and crushed by Carnage, another immediately grows back and heals Jameson.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Gerry Conway|penciller = Mike Perkins|inker = Mike Perkins|colorist = Andy Troy|letterer = VC's Joe Sabino|editor = Nick Lowe|story = The One That Got Away, Part Five|title = Carnage|volume = 2|issue = #5|date = 17 January 2016|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

===As Colonel Jupiter===
Due to alien spore infection, which was garnered during his space mission to Jupiter, Jameson had developed a supernormal physiology accommodating to the higher gravity and harsher atmospheric conditions of the planet. Doubling his original size and physical strength, particularly in his lower body which allows for jumping and leaping great distances at a time, even being able to move fast enough to intercept Spider-Man with relative ease. Colonel Jupiter also boasts increased skin, bone and muscle density; enough to resist superstrength blows from Spider-Man, as well as dish out enough force to rupture steel or shatter masonry barehanded, even by accident.

===As the Man-Wolf===
As the Man-Wolf, Jameson possessed superhuman strength, agility, speed and durability, an accelerated healing factor and heightened senses. He also has razor-sharp teeth and claws to use as weapons once transformed. The Man-Wolf's levels of strength and intelligence varied according to the phases of the moon. Jameson did not retain his human personality or intelligence while in his Man-Wolf form; though the bestial side ''is'' capable of speech, it does not talk too often.<ref name="Carnage vol. 2 #3"/> He was not a traditional supernatural werewolf and was thus invulnerable not only to silver, but to weapons in general.

===As the Stargod=== 
While in the Other Realm, the Stargod possessed both his human intelligence and speech while in the Man-Wolf's body. As well as giving him vast superhuman strength, a high degree of durability on top of cosmic and telepathic powers. Jameson, eventually learning to utilize the Stargod power by force of will, could consciously change between his human and werewolf forms enabling him to fly across interstellar distances, survive within the cold depths of space unprotected and without a space suit, even teleport between dimensions like Earth and the Other Realm under his own power. He wears scale mail armor and uses a broadsword, a dagger, and a longbow with arrows as weapons.

===Spider-Gwen===
On Earth-65, the home of Spider-Gwen, Jameson as the Man-Wolf is one of the major crime bosses of New York with henchmen working for him all over the city.

Jonah Jameson, has him released, claiming he "wasn't in the right mind" during his time as the Man-Wolf.<ref>''Ghost Spider'' #1</ref>

===''What If?''===
In "[[What If (comics)|What If]] the Radioactive Spider Had Bitten Someone Else?", John Jameson is one of three candidates - along with [[Betty Leeds|Betty Brant]] and [[Flash Thompson]] - who is bitten by the radioactive spider which gave [[Spider-Man]] his powers. Equipped with a rocket pack, and upon his father's relentless prompting for the sake of his paper's publicity, John begins to fight crime as "Spider-Jameson". However, when he attempts to save an astronaut from his crashing capsule (the same situation from which he was saved by Spider-Man in [[Earth-616|mainstream continuity]]), his rocket pack runs out of fuel, but Jameson heroically sacrifices his life by using his own body to cushion the capsule's impact. The death of his son makes Jonah Jameson re-think his relentless attitudes, and he subsequently dedicates ''The Daily Bugle'' to the ''promotion'' of superheroes, ''not'' their persecution.<ref>''What If?'' #7</ref>

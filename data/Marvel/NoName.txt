'''Planet Hulk''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] storyline that ran primarily through issues of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' starting in 2006. Written by [[Greg Pak]], it dealt with the Marvel heroes' decision to send the [[Hulk]] away, his acclimation to and conquest of the planet where he landed, and his efforts to return to Earth to take his revenge.

There was also a special ''Planet Hulk: Gladiator Guidebook'' publication by [[Anthony Flamini]] and the storyline's main writer Greg Pak, similar to the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' detailing the characters, races and cultures within the storyline.

Elements from the storyline have been adapted into other media, including an [[Marvel Animated Features#Planet Hulk|animated film of the same name]], as well as the live action film ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]''.

==Publication history==
The storyline's main writer [[Greg Pak]] describes the origin of the ideas: "The inspiration for sending Hulk to an alien planet where he'd battle monsters as a gladiator came from Marvel Editor-in-Chief [[Joe Quesada]]. I loved the idea from the minute I heard it, so I was blown away when they told me I had the gig and even more blown away when they basically cut me loose to create the whole world".<ref name=cbr8093>{{cite web |first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=8093 |title=Green World: Pak talks "Incredible Hulk" |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=September 15, 2006 |access-date=January 25, 2010 }}</ref> He also drew from real-world history: "I got inspiration for the story by reading about the real lives of gladiators in ancient Rome and from the stories of figures like [[Genghis Khan]] and more contemporary warlords, dictators, and political leaders. [[Sun Tzu]]'s ''[[The Art of War|Art of War]]'' and [[Joseph Campbell]]'s ''[[Power of Myth]]'' played a big role in helping me think through other aspects of the story".<ref name=cbr8093 />

The story's roots began in the ''New Avengers: Illuminati'' [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] and ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|Incredible Hulk]]'' #88–91. The main storyline was told in ''Incredible Hulk'' #92–105, and  ''Giant-Size Hulk'' vol 2 #1.

It led directly to the ''[[World War Hulk]]'' crossover, and inspired the ''Son of Hulk'' series.

The story was re-examined in ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]: Planet Hulk''.

In October 2017, a sequel, titled ''Return to the Planet Hulk'', starring [[Amadeus Cho]] as the Hulk, was released as a part of Marvel's ''[[Marvel Legacy]]'' initiative.

==Plot==

===Build up===
When a Gamma bomb causes the [[Hulk]] to lose control and attack Las Vegas,<ref>''Fantastic Four #533–535,</ref> the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] decide the Hulk is too dangerous to remain on Earth.<ref>''New Avengers: Illuminati'' one-shot</ref> With the help of the Hulk's friend and psychiatrist [[Doc Samson]],<ref name=hulkno106>''Incredible Hulk'' #106 (July 2007)</ref> they trick him into entering orbit to destroy a rogue satellite, and then use a shuttle to jettison him from the solar system. They intended for him to land on a peaceful planet, but the shuttle passes through a wormhole on its way.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #88–91 (Dec 2005 – Mar 2006)</ref>

===Planet Hulk===
As Hulk listens to a recording from the Illuminati explaining their actions, his shuttle crashes on the planet [[Sakaar]]. Weakened from the crash, Hulk is fixed with an obedience disk and taken into slavery. He is forced to fight gladiator battles for the planet's emperor, the Red King.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 3) #92</ref> Hulk forms a "Warbound" pact with his fellow gladiators [[Miek]], No-Name [[Brood (comics)|Brood]], [[Elloe Kaifi]], Lavin Skee, [[Hiroim]] and [[Korg (comics)|Korg]].

Hulk becomes a popular hero for his actions in the arena, and a group of insurgents try to recruit the Hulk to their cause.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 3) #93</ref> The Hulk declines, but Elloe chooses to go with the rebels.

During their next gladiator fight, Lavin Skee is killed.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 3) #94</ref> As the others come closer to winning their freedom, the Red King's lieutenant, [[Caiera]], arranges for them to fight the Silver <!--Do NOT change this to Beta Ray Bill, he was NOT in the comic book.-->Surfer, who is also controlled by an obedience disk. During the battle, the Hulk breaks the Silver<!--Do NOT change this to Beta Ray Bill, he was NOT in the comic book.--> Surfer's disk, freeing him. After the Hulk and Warbound refuse to kill a captured Elloe alongside two other rebels, the Silver<!--Do NOT change this to Beta Ray Bill, he was NOT in the comic book.--> Surfer then destroys all the obedience disks of everyone in the arena. As he leaves Sakaar, he offers to return Hulk to Earth. Hulk chooses to stay behind.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 3) #95</ref>

The Hulk and his Warbound, now re-joined by Elloe and on the run from the Red King, are hunted by Caiera. As they travel through villages, Hulk finds followers who believe he is the foretold savior, "Sakaarson". Hulk denies this title. Caiera finally confronts the Hulk, but their battle is interrupted by an invasion of "spikes" that cause monstrous mutations and death to anyone they touch. Caiera calls the Red King for assistance and learns that he ordered the spikes to be deployed there. Horrified at what her king has done, Caiera joins the Hulk.

Hulk leads a raid on the Red King's capital, culminating in a one-on-one battle between the two of them. The Red King is defeated, and Hulk is named the new king. He takes Caiera for his wife, and the two are able to broker peace among the various conflicts which had festered under the Red King. Caiera becomes pregnant with Hulk's child.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #104</ref>

Meanwhile, the shuttle that brought the Hulk to Sakaar is being turned into a monument. As part of its self-destruct sequence, the antimatter [[warp core]] engine detonates in a massive explosion. The whole city is destroyed, and Caiera dies. Enraged and blaming the Avengers who built the shuttle for the damage, the Hulk and his Warbound leave Sakaar and head for Earth.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #105</ref>

===Aftermath===
Arriving on Earth, Hulk and the warbound begin [[World War Hulk]].<ref>''World War Hulk'' #1–5</ref>

Sakaar rebuilds after the explosion with the help of the Hulk's two surviving sons, [[Skaar (character)|Skaar]] and [[Hiro-Kala]].<ref>''Son of Hulk'' #1–18</ref>

==Other versions==

===What If?===
A special issue of ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' featured three alternate versions of Planet Hulk:
* The first story shows the Hulk sacrificing himself to save Caiera by throwing her into the planet's orbit. Caiera survives and upon returning to Sakaar, she is met by the Warbound who learn of the Hulk's death while Miek is killed trying to find the Hulk. Caiera absorbs all of Sakaar's energy, becoming more powerful than ever, before heading to Earth with the Warbound. Doctor Strange and the Sentry intercept the ship, but Caiera uses the captured Black Bolt to vaporize them. Caiera then attacks the Fantastic Four, killing Reed Richards and eventually Iron Man. The Avengers attempt to fight her, but Caiera easily defeats them as well. Caiera then proceeds to kill the remaining heroes, but Hiroim stops her, pointing out that the "guilty have paid" and that if she wipes out everyone on the planet, no one will be left to honor the Hulk. Caiera agrees to stop fighting, but remarks that "they'll wish they were dead". Twenty-one years later, Caiera now rules earth and has enslaved humanity, while her son, Skaar, has erected a colossal statue of her late husband. 
* The second story involves the Hulk landing on the planet that the Illuminati had promised him, instead of Sakaar. The Hulk begins to coexist with the creatures and finds life on the planet to be more peaceful than on earth, whilst being involved in a personal struggle between himself and Bruce Banner. Years pass, and the Hulk's actions have caused the planet's evolution to take a turn and centuries later, intelligent, humanoid beings now inhabit the planet and most consider stories of the Hulk to be only a legend. One young boy, however, sees the Hulk, who is now smaller, more "native" to the world, and at peace.
* In "What If Bruce Banner Landed on Sakaar Instead of the Hulk", Hulk's shuttle lands on Sakaar, and thinking this is a peaceful planet, the Hulk regresses to Bruce Banner, only to be killed shortly after. A year later, Reed Richards lands on Sakaar to bring Banner back to Earth but is killed as well. Ten years later, a number of heroes have been killed on Sakaar, with Hawkeye being the most recent victim.

===Secret Wars (2015)===

* The 2017 film ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', which is also set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, adapts elements of the ''Planet Hulk'' story.

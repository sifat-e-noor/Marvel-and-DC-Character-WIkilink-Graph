==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=March 2013}}
Following his introduction, the Dane Whitman Black Knight became a recurring character in the superhero-team comic ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'', with his first solo story appearing shortly afterward in ''[[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]'' #17 (Nov. 1968).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=128}}</ref> From 1979 to 1980, the Black Knight also appeared in a black and white feature in the [[Marvel UK]] comic ''[[Hulk Weekly]]'', where the feature was to be the longest-lasting of the comic's UK-originated material, appearing in the majority of the title's 63 issues. It was written by [[Steve Parkhouse]] with art by [[Paul Neary]] and [[John Stokes (artist)|John Stokes]].<!--cite needed for following, and [[WP:DATED]] issue fixed: the complete story is set to be reprinted in the last two volumes of Panini's original ''Captain Britain'' collections.--> He also appeared in his own Marvel US title, the [[miniseries]] ''Black Knight'' #1–4 (June–Sept. 1990) by husband-and-wife writers [[Roy Thomas|Roy]] and [[Dann Thomas]] and successive [[penciller]]s [[Tony DeZuniga]] and [[Rich Buckler]]. This was followed by the [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Black Knight: Exodus'' #1 (Dec. 1996), by writer [[Ben Raab]] and penciller [[Jimmy Cheung]].

Co-creator Roy Thomas commented on the character's conception, "The Black Knight was a combination, visually, of the [[Black Knight (Marvel Comics)|Black Knight]] that [[Stan Lee]] and [[Joe Maneely]] made up in the mid-1950s, with the concept Stan Lee and [[Jack Kirby]] had done as a villain of that name, complete with winged horse, in [[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]].  There was also a bit of an homage in there to a [[DC Comics|DC]] hero I'd liked in the 1940s, [[Shining Knight (Sir Justin)|Shining Knight]].  I shouldn't have named his horse Aragorn, though.  I wasn't even that great an admirer of [[The Lord of the Rings]]. [[John Buscema]], was scheduled to be the artist of the story that introduced Dane Whitman dressed in the Black Knight costume into THE AVENGERS, but that wound up being a guest stint by [[George Tuska]] when Stan Lee took John off the book for one issue to do something else.  It was [[John Verpoorten]] and I that designed the costume."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://hero-envy.blogspot.com/2020/01/the-roy-thomas-marvel-comics-characters_1.html | title="Hero Envy" the Blog Adventures: THE ROY THOMAS MARVEL COMICS CHARACTERS, CONCEPTS AND CREATIONS PART 1 | date=January 2020 }}</ref>

He and other Marvel characters were brought to the short-lived [[Ultraverse]] imprint. The Black Knight appeared in the [[Ultraforce]] team book volumes 1 and 2 and related titles in 1995–96. Then the character became part of the teams: [[Heroes for Hire]] (1997), [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] (2003), [[MI-13 (comics)|MI-13]] (2008) and Euroforce.

In July 2015, it was announced that [[Frank Tieri (writer)|Frank Tieri]] and [[Luca Pizzari]] would be launching a new ''Black Knight'' series as part of Marvel's post-"[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" relaunch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/tieri-pizzari-bring-black-knight-to-all-new-all-different-marvel|title=Tieri & Pizzari Bring "Black Knight" to All-New All-Different Marvel|date=July 31, 2015|website=Comicbookresources.com|access-date=October 30, 2017}}</ref> This series features Whitman as the ruler of New Avalon, a kingdom he has claimed in the reality known as [[Weirdworld]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/25407-black-knight-returns-in-all-new-all-different-marvel-series.html|title=Black Knight Returns In All-New All-Different Marvel Series|website=Newsarama.com|access-date=October 30, 2017}}</ref> The ongoing series was cancelled with issue #5 in 2016, as Marvel was unhappy with its sales. The writer of the series, Frank Tieri, then considered it a standalone limited series and expressed his feelings over the series being cut short. ''Black Knight'' is notable as the first "All-New, All-Different Marvel" comic book series to be cancelled.<ref name=ca/>

==Fictional character biography==

===Early life===
Dane Whitman was born in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts]] to a rich family. In his youth, he studied physics. Whitman is best known as the modern-day Black Knight, continuing a legacy that began in medieval England. The first [[Black Knight (Sir Percy)|Black Knight]], Whitman's ancestor Sir Percy of Scandia, lived during the reign of King Arthur.<ref>''Black Knight'' #1-5 (1955). Marvel Comics.</ref> Percy's murder at the hand of his nemesis [[Mordred (comics)|Mordred]]<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes'' #17 (1968). Marvel Comics.</ref> began a string of successors, all of them Percy's descendants.

The Black Knight's legacy is revived by Whitman's uncle Nathan Garrett who becomes the [[supervillain]] the [[Black Knight (Nathan Garrett)|Black Knight II]].<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #52 (1964). Marvel Comics.</ref> After being mortally wounded during a battle with [[Iron Man]], he escapes to his estate, summons his nephew to confess his crimes and asks him to restore honor to their family legacy and atone for Garrett's misdeeds, giving Whitman the weapons that he used for crime.<ref>''The Avengers'' #47. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===The Avengers===
Whitman becomes the Black Knight, using the horse [[Aragorn (comics)|Aragorn]] for his mount. He uses the genetic techniques of his uncle to give the horse wings. During his first outing, he is mistaken for his uncle and attacked by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] though they eventually realize their mistake.<ref>''The Avengers'' #48. Marvel Comics.</ref> He later infiltrates the [[Masters of Evil]], proving his worth to the Avengers who offer him provisional membership.<ref>''The Avengers'' #54. Marvel Comics.</ref> Shortly afterwards he inherits Castle Garrett and travels to England. He encounters the spirit of Sir Percy of Scandia there and is given the [[Ebony Blade]].<ref>''Marvel Super Heroes'' #17. Marvel Comics.</ref> He then encounters [[Doctor Strange]] and helps fight the extra-dimensional threat [[Tiboro]].<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #178. Marvel Comics.</ref>

While still a provisional Avenger, he helps them in a battle against [[Kang the Conqueror]]. Kang was given the power of death over the Avengers by the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] as a prize for winning a recent game that Whitman has become unwittingly involved in. When he assists Goliath (Hawkeye) in defeating his chosen opponent, the Grandmaster calls that round of the game a draw since the Avengers did not defeat their opponents on their own. Since Whitman is not a full Avenger at the time, Kang has no power over him and so Whitman is able to defeat him with relative ease. Whitman then officially joins the Avengers in recognition of his aid.<ref>''The Avengers'' #71. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, the Ebony Blade is used by the Olympian war god [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]] to put out the Promethean Flame and turn most of the Olympians to crystal. The Black Knight travels to Olympus with other members and helps defeat Ares.<ref>''The Avengers'' #100. Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== The Defenders and Otherworld ===
Whitman is an early member of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. He was traveling with the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]] to the realm of the Asgardian sorceress Casiolena, to a parallel dimension. However, they were captured and imprisoned by the witch. When the Defenders also are trapped by Casiolena, the Black Knight and a newly invoked [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]] joins them in the battle against Casiolena. However Whitman becomes the first casualty of the Defenders, after he is treacherously converted to stone by a kiss from the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]]. [[Doctor Strange]] tries to revert the spell without success.<ref>''The Defenders'' #4 (Feb. 1973). Marvel Comics.</ref> Whitman's spirit is drawn to the 12th century by the sorcerer Amergin the [[Druid]], and he takes [[spiritual possession]] of his ancestor, the Crusader Sir Eobar Garrington, until Garrington dies due to the [[Evil Eye of Avalon|Evil Eye]]. Meanwhile, Whitman chooses to stay in the 12th century and is cared for by fellow Defender, the Valkyrie.<ref>''The Defenders'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> Whitman then battles the Fomor, alongside the time-traveling Avengers. He then employs the Evil Eye to seal the portal between Earth and [[Otherworld (Marvel Comics)|Avalon]]. Whitman returns to the 20th century and his original body is restored. He is accompanied by a gift from Amergin: a black, winged horse called Valinor, named after the [[Valinor|fictional location of that name]].<ref>''The Avengers'' #225. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Some time later, still in Garrington's body, the wizard [[Merlin (comics)|Merlyn]] takes Whitman as his champion. He is commanded to find the hero [[Captain Britain]], who is wandering in the coast of Cornwall. Merlyn needs the hero for the defense of Otherworld, his realm, that is being attacked by the Nethergods.<ref>''Hulk Comic'' #1 (March 1979). Marvel Comics.</ref> The Black Knight is attacked many times by creatures invoked by the sorcerer [[Mordred (comics)|Mordred]] but he finds Captain Britain, who is amnesiac.<ref>''Hulk Comic'' #3-5 (March 1979). Marvel Comics.</ref> On the road to Otherworld, both heroes are assisted by the old witch Sarah Mumford, the Walker [[Vortigern]], an old king of Britain, and the elf Moondog, the last two sent by Merlyn from Otherworld.<ref>''Hulk Comic'' #6-11 (April- May 1979). Marvel Comics.</ref> On the road, they are attacked by the Iron Ogre, a magic creature invoked by the Evil Walker Cormac. The Ogre bests the heroes and destroys the Ebony Blade. Only a precise arrow shot by the elf Moondog stops the creature.<ref>''Hulk Comic'' #12 (May 1979). Marvel Comics.</ref> Cormac sends Goblins to battle the heroes and briefly captures Moondog.<ref>''Hulk Comic'' #13-18 (May–July 1979). Marvel Comics.</ref> Meanwhile, when the Black Knight is devastated by the loss of his sword, he meets the [[Lady of the lake]], who gives him the magic sword [[Excalibur]]. With the sword, Whitman defeats Cormac.<ref>''Hulk Comic'' #19 (July 1979). Marvel Comics.</ref> In the meantime Captain Britain is killed by the White Rider, one of the servants of the Nethergod Mandrac, at the door of the passage of Otherworld<ref>''Hulk Comic'' #20-21 (July–Aug. 1979). Marvel Comics.</ref> Whitman and his companions finally cross the doors of Otherworld and fight Mandrac, Lord of the Slain, who was in possession of the body of Captain Britain. Merlyn appears to help the knight and traps Mandrac inside the earth - Merlyn rescues the spirit of Captain Britain from Netherword and defeats [[Mordred (comics)|Modred]], who was attacking him and the knight.<ref>''Hulk Comic'' #24-30 (August–September 1979). Marvel Comics.</ref> In the Otherworld dimension, the Black Knight and Captain Britain go to save Camelot from the attacks of the Nethergod Necromon. In the process, Merlyn reforges the Ebony Sword and King Arthur is resurrected. In the final assault, Whitman and King Arthur succeed in killing Necromon, but Camelot is destroyed.<ref>''Hulk Comic'' #42–63 (March 1979–May 1980). Marvel Comics.</ref> Black Knight and Captain Britain are briefly kidnapped by the Grandmaster to participate in the original Contest of Champions.<ref>''Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions'' #1–3 (June–Aug. 1982). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===The blood curse===
Once in modern times again, Whitman learns that the Ebony Blade is cursed: every time it draws blood, it drives its user closer to madness. Whitman frees Sir Percy's spirit from the Earthly plane, purging the blood curse from the sword.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 2 #68–69. Marvel Comics.</ref> Whitman resumes active duty with the Avengers,<ref>''The Avengers'' #254. Marvel Comics.</ref> helping his teammates Wasp and [[Monica Rambeau|Captain Marvel]] experiment with their powers, and battles against the fourth version of the Masters of Evil when they invade [[Avengers Mansion]].<ref>''The Avengers'' #273–277.  Marvel Comics.</ref>

When the [[Sub-Mariner]] uses the sword to kill his wife [[Marrina (comics)|Marrina]], who had become a monster, the blood curse is revived. The curse begins to transform Whitman's body into the same mystic metal as the blade.<ref>''The Avengers'' #293. Marvel Comics.</ref> He is forced to don an exoskeleton when the curse's creeping paralysis begins to affect his mobility. He also shows signs of mental instability.<ref>''The Avengers'' #294. Marvel Comics.</ref> Ultimately, the blood curse becomes so virulent that it will draw blood from anyone even touching the Black Knight.<ref>''The Avengers'' #295. Marvel Comics.</ref> After the Avengers were disbanded, Whitman joined [[Thor (comics)|Thor]] to defend Asgard from an invasion of the Egyptian God Seth. After the battle, the curse converted the Black Knight to a statue of stone again.<ref>''Thor'' #396-400.(Oct. 1988-Feb. 1989) Marvel Comics.</ref> The statue is brought by the Avengers to the knight's castle in England, under the care of Lady Victoria Bentley, an old friend of Whitman. After Lady Victoria tries a spell on the statue, Sir Percy takes possession of Whitman's body to stop the blood curse. He takes a young Irish man called Sean Dolan as his squire.<ref>''Black Knight'' vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Together they go to [[Doctor Strange]]'s house to ask for help in the battle against [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]] and [[Mordred (comics)|Mordred]], who intended to return to the physical world using Morgan's old castle in Ireland. The witch summoned the demon Balor, but the heroes are rescued by [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]] (summoned by Victoria Bentley).<ref>''Black Knight'' vol. 2 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> After banishing the villains, Sir Percy's spirit merges with the Ebony Sword, canceling the curse and returning Whitman to his normal state. The Black Knight begins a relation with Victoria Bentley and keeps Sean Dolan as his squire.<ref>''Black Knight'' vol. 2 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Sersi and the Gatherers Saga===
After rejoining the Avengers, Whitman is a major member of the team. In this time he develops a weapon that projects a sword-like sheath of energy as a replacement of his Ebony Blade.<ref>''The Avengers'' #343. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Black Knight is involved in the Avengers' attack of the [[Kree]] Empire during the [[Operation Galactic Storm]], forming part of the team that went to the capital world in Hala. At the end of the mission, tormented by the genocide inflicted by the Kree Supreme Intelligence on its own people, he and other Avengers follow [[Iron Man]] to kill the entity. The Black Knight is the one that struck the mortal blow on the Supreme Intelligence.<ref>''The Avengers'' #346-348. Marvel Comics.</ref>

[[Captain America]] leaves the Avengers because of these events, and the Black Knight eventually becomes the ''de facto'' field leader of the Avengers. During this time, he becomes romantically involved with his teammate [[Sersi]] (of the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]]), but is also attracted by [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]], one of the [[Inhumans]]' royal family. The Avengers are attacked numerous times by alternate versions of themselves, called the Gatherers, led by the mysterious Proctor.<ref>''The Avengers'' #343-344 (1993). Marvel Comics.</ref> The relationship between The Black knight and Sersi soon comes under strain, as Sersi proves increasingly unstable and more aggressive, so when the Avengers travel to the planet Polemachus and the tyrant Anskar killed an innocent girl, Sersi killed him immediately.<ref>''The Avengers'' #358-359 (1993). Marvel Comics.</ref> Her fellow Eternals, led by [[Ikaris]], pay a visit to the Avengers and tell them that Sersi was affected by the ''Mahd W'yry'', an incurable disease. In an attempt to stabilize her, and because she asked, Ikaris mentally bonds Sersi and Whitman with a process called the "''Gann Josin''", but this does little to slow the disease – not in the least due to Whitman's resentment at having the bond imposed upon him, and that he had come to the conclusion that it was Crystal he loved. With the bond, the Black Knight acquired more strength, red eyes, and an intimate mental connection with Sersi.<ref>''The Avengers'' #361 (1994). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Meanwhile, the Ebony Sword comes into the possession of Sean Dolan, "[[squire]]" of the Black Knight; he becomes angry by Whitman's abandonment of Lady Victoria and transforms himself into the [[Bloodwraith]] when he could not endure the sword's curse.<ref>''The Avengers'' Annual #22 (1993). Marvel Comics.</ref> In a three-man fight with the Black Knight and [[Deadpool]], Bloodwraith accidentally kills Lady Victoria.<ref>''The Avengers'' #366 (1993). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The mental health of Sersi becomes worse with time. When she is framed for the murder of two policemen, Sersi snaps completely, destroying the Avengers mansion and fleeing to the [[Brooklyn Bridge]]. She used the [[Gann Josin]] bond to call Whitman to aid her and they battle the Avengers together – until the sight of her attacking Crystal enables the Black Knight to break the ''Gann Josin'''s hold on him temporarily.<ref>''The Avengers'' #373 (1994). Marvel Comics.</ref> Then it is revealed that it was Proctor who caused the Mahd W'yry disease in Sersi. Whitman also discovers that Proctor is an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] counterpart of himself.<ref>''The Avengers'' #374 (1994). Marvel Comics.</ref> Having been rejected by his own Sersi and twisted by the ''Gann Josin'' and his Ebony Blade's curse, Proctor now travels the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]] with the aid of the Gatherers and a captured [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] named Ute on a mission to kill the Sersi of every reality. Ultimately, in the battle of the Avengers against the Gatherers, Sersi slays Proctor with his own Ebony Blade, but is still afflicted by the madness Proctor instilled in her. A mortally injured Ute uses the last of his power to create a gateway into another universe where Sersi could be free of the madness and restore her mind. Whitman decides to leave with her, partly because he does not want to come between Crystal and her husband [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and partly because he feels responsible for what happened to Sersi.<ref>''The Avengers'' #375 (1994). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Ultraforce and Exodus===
{{main|Ultraforce}}
The pair are transported to the [[Ultraverse]] (home of the [[Malibu Comics]] characters). They are separated and the Black Knight arrives at the Miami Beach of this universe. Here he meets the young heroes [[Prime (comics)|Prime]] and [[Ultraforce#Prototype|Prototype]], members of a local superhero team called [[Ultraforce (comics)|Ultraforce]]. Whitman impresses them and tells his story. He becomes a member of Ultraforce and begins the search for Sersi.<ref>''Ultraforce'' #8-9 (1995). Malibu Comics.</ref> After being tricked by the god [[Loki (Marvel Comics)]], Whitman meets Sersi again, but she was possessed by the seventh infinity gem, the Ego gem and attacked him. When he approached her, she recognized him and stopped. However, she was still being controlled by the Ego gem and captured him and Ultraforce for Loki. Black Knight and the rest of the team escaped.<ref>''Ultraforce/Avengers Prelude'' #1 (1995). Malibu Comics.</ref> In a dispute between [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] and the Grandmaster for the possession of the [[Infinity Gems]], the heroes of [[Ultraforce (comics)|Ultraforce]] were put against his counterparts of Earth-616: the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. The Black Knight was left as a wild card in the competition. Loki won but when the six original gems were reunited, the combined sentient power of the Gems was revealed as the entity Nemesis.<ref>''Avengers /Ultraforce'' #1 (1995). Marvel Comics.</ref> The entity began to create a mixed reality when she combined elements of Ultraverse and Marvel. Both teams joined forces against Nemesis and The Black Knight struck a blow to Nemesis with a Nazi Ebony Sword that scattered the Infinity gems.<ref>''Ultraforce/Avengers'' #1 (1995). Malibu Comics.</ref> Because of this, the [[Ultraverse]] was affected by a reality-warping event called [[Ultraverse#Black September|Black September]], after which Dane Whitman become the leader of [[Ultraforce (comics)|Ultraforce]].<ref>''Ultraforce'' vol. 2 #1 (1995). Malibu Comics.</ref> As leader, Dane Whitman brought Ultraforce in line, adopting new methods, bringing new members, managing the team and having a romantic tension with fellow member [[Ultraforce#Topaz|Topaz]]<ref>''Ultraforce'' vol. 2 #2-10 (1995). Malibu Comics.</ref>

After various adventures with Ultraforce, the Black Knight and other heroes of Ultraverse fought against an Alien robot, Maxis,.<ref>''Ultraforce'' vol. 2 #12 (1995). Malibu Comics.</ref> Immediately after defeating the robot, the armada of the Tulkan aliens attacked New York with his powerful elite. Whitman led the victory against the aliens. After the flight of the Tulkans, the robot Maxis becomes more benevolent, and created an interdimensional portal. Whitman returned to [[Earth-616]] with other exiles through this portal.<ref>''Ultraverse Unlimited'' #2 (1996). Malibu Comics.</ref>

He and Sersi briefly reunite to return to the Marvel Universe, but something goes wrong along the way. Instead of returning to the Marvel universe's present, they end up in the 12th century and Whitman once again finds his spirit in the body of Sir Eobar Garrington. His consciousness is buried under Garrington's, however, and Sersi is forced to pass Garrington's soul onto the next plane (with his permission) to restore Whitman's consciousness. Whitman finds himself embroiled in a conflict with the evil mutant [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] alongside his ancestor's best friend Bennet du Paris, the mutant who would later become [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]]. Apocalypse tries to get du Paris to kill his friend, but du Paris refuses.  Judging him weak, Apocalypse puts du Paris in a state of suspended animation. Out of respect for his ancestor's friendship with du Paris, Whitman organizes an order of knights to guard du Paris' body, which they do through the ages until he is found and revived by [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]. Sersi creates another portal, this time to the correct time period, and she and Whitman depart the 12th century.<ref>''Black Knight: Exodus'' #1 (1995). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Heroes for Hire===
Whitman and Sersi are somehow separated in transit, which rips their ''Gann Josin'' bond apart. Whitman finds himself back in New York in the proper time, but without Sersi. He is soon dealt another shattering blow when he learns that the Avengers and most of the other major heroes have apparently perished in their battle with [[Onslaught (Marvel Comics)|Onslaught]] while he was gone, including [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]]. Whitman then learns that the [[Lady of the Lake]] has selected him as the Pendragon for his age. She bestows upon him new mystical equipment from [[Avalon]]: a suit of armor, the enchanted flying horse Strider, the Shield of Night, which absorbs energy, and the Sword of Light, which returns that energy in the form of an energy projectile.<ref name="Hire' 1997">''Heroes for Hire'' #2-3 (1997). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The newly empowered Black Knight helps the [[Heroes for Hire]] defeat [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]], then accepts [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]'s offer to join the newly formed team (due primarily to his concern over former teammate and friend [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], who has been drinking heavily out of grief for the Avengers' deaths).<ref name="Hire' 1997"/> Whitman eventually learns what happened to Sersi when she reappears asking for help to defeat yet another of her old enemy [[Ghaur]]'s nefarious schemes with the help of the Eternals. After the team-up, Sersi and Whitman decided to be separated. Later, the Heroes for Hire find themselves in the midst of a major conflict in the [[High Evolutionary]]'s city of [[Wundagore]].<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' #4-17 (1997). Marvel Comics.</ref> During this time, Whitman fought again with [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] for the affection of the inhuman [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]], but she rejected both of them.<ref>'' Quicksilver'' #7 (1998). Marvel Comics.</ref> The Black Knight leaves Heroes for Hire to assist the [[New Men (Marvel Comics)|Knights of Wundagore]] along with Quicksilver and later returns to the Avengers when they expand their roster to include satellite teams around the world. Whitman is sent to the [[Slorenia]]n border, where the Bloodwraith has used the Ebony Blade to absorb the souls of the entire population after they have been killed by the android [[Ultron]]. After the "Kang War" arc, the Avengers disband these global teams.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 3 #1-4 (1998). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''New Excalibur''===
Whitman reappears in ''[[New Excalibur]]'' in the mid-2000s. He has opened up a museum in England chronicling the Black Knights that have existed throughout history. Whitman learns that Sir Percy was not the original Black Knight, but that eight men had held the Ebony Blade prior to him. The Ebony Blade, however, corrupted these men, and Sir Percy was deemed the only one who was noble enough to wield the Blade. Also at this time, Merlin told Whitman that he must not destroy the Blade as he had previously been told to do. It is not clear whether he has access to his Avalonian equipment at present. In ''New Excalibur'', Whitman is invited to join the team, but after the second adventure with them he refuses, as he believes that his [[Ebony Blade]] is not the real one and he needs to find the original.<ref>''New Excalibur'' #10–11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===MI-13===
{{main|Captain Britain and MI13}}
Whitman returns to join [[MI-13 (comics)|MI-13]] as part of the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' crossover event.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=12843 Super Spy Weekend: Black Knight], [[Comic Book Resources]], March 10, 2008</ref> He is armed by what he believes was the Ebony Blade, which strongly encourages him to kill, but is later revealed to be a fake<ref>''Captain Britain and MI-13'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> created by Dracula;<ref>''Captain Britain and MI:13'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> this fake possesses an intelligence and feeds on blood. Whitman also is revealed to have a literal stone heart, given to him by Sersi to keep him "above it all" and uninvolved.<ref name="Captain Britain and MI-13 #10">''Captain Britain and MI-13'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Whitman battles the [[Skrull]] forces in [[London]], showing a new informal and wisecracking personality (a deliberate defence against the "Ebony Blade's" suggestions), and quickly bonds with medic [[Faiza Hussain]], with whom he appears to have romantic tensions. Following the Skrull war, he makes her his [[squire]].<ref>''Captain Britain and MI-13'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After discovering that he did not have the real Ebony Blade, he goes to [[Wakanda]] and is given the real Blade back.

===''Original Sin''===
During the events of ''[[Original Sin (comics)|Original Sin]]'', a historian named [[Rebecca Stevens (comics)|Rebecca Stevens]] learns that Whitman had violently attacked and nearly killed a new version of Savage Steel due to the influence of the Ebony Blade. Rebecca pleads with him to turn over the sword to [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] or the Avengers, reasoning that its bloodlust is driving him mad, but Whitman refuses. Despite his assurance that he is fine, his home is seen covered in slash marks, with Whitman himself curled up on the floor in a mentally unhinged state. He is also seen threatening to slay Rebecca with the Blade, but she remains unaware of the danger.<ref>''Original Sins'' #2 (2014). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Around this same time, Whitman returns to action as the leader of Euroforce, a team of European superheroes.<ref>''Avengers World'' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref> Though he claims to not be bitter about being excluded from Captain America's new team of Avengers, it is implied that Whitman's deteriorating mental state had been the reason that he was passed over for membership.<ref>''Avengers World'' #10 (2014). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Journey to Weirdworld===
As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, the Black Knight arrives on [[Weirdworld]] after killing [[Exemplars (comics)#Carnivore|Carnivore]] while losing control to the Ebony Blade, which causes him to flee from the scene of Carnivore's death. Upon arriving on Weirdworld, he kills King Zaltin Tar to establish New Avalon and builds an army with the help of two warriors named Shield and Spear.<ref>''Black Knight'' vol. 4 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Black Knight has the army built in anticipation of the arrival of the [[Uncanny Avengers|Avengers Unity Division]], who are seeking to bring him to justice.<ref>''Black Knight'' vol. 4 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> After struggling to maintain his sanity, Whitman is forced to battle the Uncanny Avengers, led by the aged Steve Rogers, who wish to arrest him for killing a criminal when he was still part of the Avengers team.<ref>''Black Knight'' vol. 4 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> It is revealed that Whitman accidentally entered Weirdworld, along with a HYDRA submarine, from 1945. The members of Hydra on board the submarine became the group known as the Fangs of the Serpent to the inhabitants of Weirdworld.<ref name="Black Knight Vol. 4 #5">''Black Knight'' vol. 4 #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> As the Uncanny Avengers arrive to arrest Whitman, he unites the armies of the land to fight against them. Eventually, he is defeated and a truce is made: Rogers will take the Ebony Blade back to Earth and Whitman will be free to rule New Avalon. However, Rogers is possessed by the Blade and attacks his teammates.<ref>''Black Knight'' vol. 4 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> Meanwhile, the son of the king that Whitman overthrew to become the new lord gathers the Fangs of the Serpent to attack Whitman. After their defeat, Rogers and Doctor Voodoo agree that the only person who can bear the toll of the Ebony Blade is Whitman, and the Blade also shows this by not allowing any harm to come to Whitman. As the Avengers leave, leaving behind an expert on the Black Knight who came with them to look after Whitman, it is concluded that Whitman had been maintaining his sanity better than everyone had thought. Whitman concludes that for now ruling New Avalon is good, and the story ends on a light tone, Whitman not being persecuted as he has suffered enough under the Blade's spell.<ref name="Black Knight Vol. 4 #5"/>

===Return to heroic activity===
During "[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]", Black Knight returns to Europe to help Euroforce fight HYDRA groups following their conquest of the United States. The group is imprisoned by HYDRA until they were freed by the Champions of Europe.<ref>''U.S.Avengers'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In "[[The War of the Realms]]" event, the Black Knight, Union Jack, and Spitfire are defeated by Malekith the Accursed. Before he can slay them, he is attacked by Captain Marvel and the War Avengers.<ref>''War of the Realms'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, he helped [[Punisher]] and his kill crew when they were attacking the Dark elves and some trolls.<ref>'' Punisher: Kill Krew'' #4-5 (2019). Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Empyre]]" storyline, Black Knight tells Captain America that he has been focusing on becoming a hero again after fighting the Giants and Dark Elves. He joins other Avengers in the fight against the Cotati in the Savage Land.<ref>''Empyre: Avengers'' #1-3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later in "[[Savage Avengers]]", Dane is contacted by the more ruthless iteration of Earth's mightiest after singlehandedly tearing down a KKK operation. He was specifically nominated by [[Juggernaut (comics)|Cain Marko]] because they needed the help of his Ebony Blade to slay the dragon Sadurang, a leftover from Malekith's War of the Realms.<ref>''Savage Avengers'' #14-16. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Advent of Knull and revelations===
Sometime after the Avengers reasserted their presence in the world, the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]] would descend after the attempted takeover by [[Moon Knight]] and his patron deity Khonshu.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 8 #37. Marvel Comics.</ref> Dane would be amongst a host of other recipients selected by the enigmatic cosmic entity to participate in a tournament to decide its next host.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 8 #40-43. Marvel Comics.</ref>

With the onset of the "[[King in Black]]", The Black Knight has his hands full dealing with personal issues stemming from his loss of respect as a hero coupled with psychological issues begotten from bearing the accursed Ebony Blade. When the dark god Knull descended upon the Earth seeking to subsume it, he used his collective mind hive to invade the psyche space of the fallen hero in an attempt to claim his fabled blade from the stars. Revealing the swords true nature as an evil blade which amplifies the negative qualities in callow individuals already prone to hatred, violence and negative aspects not the other way around.<ref name="ReferenceA">''King in Black: The Black Knight'' #1</ref>

The revelation shakes Whitman to his core, as he is forced to realize the sword was never corrupting him and that Merlin lied about only the most pure-hearted beings' eligibility to use it. That all those times he went ballistic were of his own volition, the blade merely exacerbating these qualities to strengthen itself, as that was its true function.

With some convincing from the young heroine [[Aero (manhua)|Aero]] however, Dane is able to come to grips with such insights and learn to own his faults in order to help save all of Shanghai from an enclave of Symbiote Dragons taking the form of Swordmaster's own personal boogie man. Learning to use his inner darkness in such a way to unlock new powers within his signature weapon that he'd never learned to use before.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> After helping out the Avengers in resolving a mysticism based problem at Central Park, Dane is summarily cut down by a mysterious assailant using the Obsidian Dagger; the opposing weapon of the Ebony Blade.

A little while afterward the Black Knight's body is catered back to England where he is unexpectedly resurrected by a blood offering to the enchanted steel by Jackie Chopra; an Arthurian history buff he'd brought on as a liaison to better understand his familial history.<ref>''Black Knight: Curse of the Ebony Blade'' #1</ref>

Whitman has a panic attack while the two are having lunch due to the trauma of dying and resurrecting. After sending his ersatz therapist away for a bit, he decides to contact his predecessor Sir Percy to inquire about how what happened happened. It was revealed that there are many hidden powers which the Ebony Blade possesses that Dane's ancestor had not told him about. One such case being that those of Arthurs noble bloodline can draw upon the power of self-revival should they perish in battle.

But before the spirit could reveal how he died despite this aspect of the weapon, Dane's home is broken into by the monster hunter [[Elsa Bloodstone]]; another "Avengers Adjacent" who had been following a string of murders related to Dane and his ebony relic.<ref>''Black Knight: Curse of the Ebony Blade'' #2</ref> The conflict is quickly broken up by Jackie who returns after finding the mutilated remains of her history teacher. Jackie explains she has been having visions of the past ever since she touched Dane's Ebony Blade, and they all come to realize that the relics created from the same starstone that begot the fabled skein in the first place were not destroyed upon their initial creation.{{issue|date=January 2022}}

==Powers and abilities==
The Black Knight was originally a normal athletic human being with no superhuman powers. While sharing the ''gann josin'' with [[Sersi]], his strength, speed, and other physical abilities were mildly enhanced.{{issue|date=January 2022}} After the ''gann josin'' link was broken, Whitman returned to being a normal human being.{{issue|date=January 2022}} As part of his new role as the Pendragon, Whitman has gained minor mystical abilities, such as the ability to see through mystical illusions by looking "past the mundane".{{issue|date=January 2022}}

Whitman is an excellent swordsman whose skills have allowed him to best [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]] in combat.{{issue|date=January 2022}} He is also an excellent fighter in general, able to hold his own against such skilled fighters as [[Captain America]],{{issue|date=January 2022}} and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].{{issue|date=January 2022}} He is also an expert horseman. Whitman started out as a scientist, earning a master's degree in physics while being proficient in a wide array of advanced sciences and technologies, including genetic and mechanical engineering. He maintains a scientific approach and perspective more often than not, despite his ties to the world of magic. He has also demonstrated good leadership skills as leader of both the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Ultraforce (comics)|Ultraforce]]. He has strong strategic and tactical skills.

For a short while Dane became a recipient of the Phoenix Force while partaking in its mock trial contest to choose a new vessel for its power.{{issue|date=January 2022}} He lost those facilities when he was bested by the Winter Guard's Crimson Widow.{{issue|date=January 2022}}

==Weapons and equipment==
Whitman has gone through several different sets of equipment since his creation.

===Mystical armaments===
====Ebony Blade====
{{Main|Ebony Blade}}

Whitman eventually gained the Ebony Blade, a weapon that had been passed down through the ages from one of his ancestors to another. Although it was incredibly powerful, it carried a harmful curse that caused Whitman to eventually abandon it. As of ''[[New Excalibur]]'' #10, Whitman gained possession of a faux Ebony Blade.

====Excalibur====
{{Main|Excalibur}}

For a time, Dane Whitman also wielded [[Excalibur]] in his battles against the evil dark wizard Necromon in ''Hulk (UK)'' #42-63, but later relinquished it to a reborn King Arthur.

===Scientific paraphernalia===
Whitman first became the Black Knight to atone for the crimes that his uncle [[Black Knight (Nathan Garrett)|Nathan Garrett]] had committed using the name. He started out with his uncle's non-magical tools: a javelin that fired energy blasts, a suit of body armor, and a genetically-engineered winged white horse named [[Aragorn (comics)|Aragorn]].

====Power lance====
The power lance is an invention of his late uncle Garrett's.{{issue|date=June 2021}} Dane would make use of the former Black Knight's signature weapon designed through his expertise in mechanical automation as an alternative to using the Ebony Blade for a while. Taking the appearance of a typical jousting shaft, the power lance is a marvel of technological craftsmanship studded with numerous modern armaments and gadgetry.

====Neural sword====
After giving up the Ebony Blade, Whitman designed and constructed a neural sword. The neural sword appears to be made of a laser beam and cuts through non-living matter. Its "laser" blade is a neural disruptor when used against living beings; when Whitman cuts someone with the sword, it delivers a massive jolt to the being's central nervous system. This jolt is usually enough to incapacitate someone within just a few hits. Alternately, Whitman can reverse the neural sword's energy stream so that it encases its hilt and, by extension, Whitman's fist in a high-energy field. Using the sword in this fashion enables Whitman to punch with some unspecified degree of enhanced strength. The neural sword also creates a refraction field used to defend against energy-based attacks. The blade also included a lethal setting which Whitman reserved for rare circumstances.

====Photon shield====
For a brief period while in the service of MI:13, Dane too adopted a hard-light energy shield similar to those used in the past by Captain America and the U.S.Agent.

===Avalonian facilities===
In the 1997 ''[[Heroes for Hire]]'' series, the Lady of the Lake named Whitman the Pendragon for the current era and gave him an amulet. When Whitman says the word "Avalon" while wearing the amulet, he gains the following:

:'''Armor:''' The armor Whitman currently wears has been described as mystical. It is said to be supernaturally durable for its light weight, but specific information on the durability of the armor is scarce.

:'''Strider:''' Strider is a mystical creature like Valinor rather than a genetically engineered one like Aragorn, but he is unique in that he possesses mystical powers of his own. Most notably, Strider is capable of far greater air speeds than either of Whitman's previous mounts; for example, he is easily capable of breaking the sound barrier. Whitman can verbally summon Strider to appear at his side or return to Avalon as he pleases.  While mounted on Strider, Whitman is magically protected from any harsh environments, such as the depths of the ocean.

:'''Shield of Night:''' The Shield of Night is a mystical [[kite shield]]; it not only protects him from most attacks but also absorbs the energy of the forces directed against it. He can then release that stored energy in the form of power blasts from his blade, the Sword of Light. Whitman has used it to block and absorb the energy of everything from [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]]'s explosive blasts to fire to punches.

:'''Sword of Light:''' The Sword of Light is a mystical sword capable of projecting the energy absorbed by the Shield of Night in blasts of the same kind of energy. It is also supernaturally durable and can cut through almost any substance.

While Whitman still has access to Strider and the mystical armor, he has not been seen using the Shield of Night or Sword of Light for some time.

===Miscellaneous===
Whitman has also employed an atomic steed, typically used by the [[High Evolutionary]]'s [[New Men (Marvel Comics)|Knights of Wundagore]], in place of a winged horse at one time.

==Other versions==

===''Marvel Zombies''===
Dane Whitman appears as a zombified version of himself in ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'', in the one-shot issue ''[[Marvel Zombies: Dead Days]]'' #1. He battles [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] in a battle between the living and dead inhabitants of the [[Marvel Universe]] in New York City.<ref>''Marvel Zombies: Dead Days'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Ultimate Marvel''===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Dane Whitman appears in the pages of ''[[Ultimate Comics: Ultimates]]'' as a member of the [[West Coast Avengers|West Coast Ultimates]] that preceded the current group by almost a decade. This version was a corporal in the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]]. After saving the lives of his fellow soldiers from an explosive in [[Baghdad]], he received the [[Purple Heart]], the [[Silver Star Medal]], and the [[Medal of Honor]], but was left [[quadriplegic]]. As Black Knight, he is highly unstable and was kept from officially joining the team until he stabilized. This never came to pass, as the team botched the mission and the project was shut down immediately. Later, the project was revived by Ford, a corrupt California governor who sent the group to fight the [[Ultimates]].<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Ultimates'' #23. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Proctor===
Proctor is a villainous alternate version of the Black Knight who first appears in ''The Avengers'' #344 (Feb. 1992).<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=276}}</ref> He leads a team called the "Gatherers", whose goal is to kill all versions of [[Sersi]] in retaliation for the one in Proctor's reality rejecting him.

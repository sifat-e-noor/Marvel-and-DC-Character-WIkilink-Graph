'''Miles Gonzalo Morales'''<ref name=Multiversity/><ref name=MilesMoralesSM#1>[[Ahmed, Saladin]] (w), Garrón, Javier (a). ''Miles Morales: Spider-Man'' #1 (2018) Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|r|æ|l|ə|s}}) is a [[fictional character|fictional]] character, a [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], and is one of the characters known as '''Spider-Man'''. The character was created in 2011 by writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and Italian artist [[Sara Pichelli]], with input by Marvel's then-editor-in-chief [[Axel Alonso]].

Miles Morales first appeared in ''[[Ultimate Fallout]]'' #4 (August 2011), following the death of [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Peter Parker]]. The 13-year-old [[Afro–Puerto Ricans|biracial]] teenage son of an [[African Americans|African-American]] father and a [[Stateside Puerto Ricans|Puerto Rican]] mother, he is the second [[Spider-Man]] to appear in [[Ultimate Marvel]], an imprint with a separate continuity from the [[mainstream Marvel Universe]] called the [[Ultimate Universe]] ([[Earth-1610]]).<ref name=USAToday1>{{cite news|last=Truitt |first=Brian |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/comics/2011-08-01-black-spider-man_n.htm |title=Half-black, half-Dominican Spider-Man revealed |work=[[USA Today]] |date=August 2, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804223717/http://www.usatoday.com/life/comics/2011-08-01-black-spider-man_n.htm |archive-date=August 4, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He was featured in the ''[[Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man]]'' comic book series, and after Marvel ended the Ultimate imprint in 2015, Miles was made a character in the main [[Marvel Universe]] ([[Earth-616]]), beginning with stories under the [[All-New, All-Different Marvel]] branding that debuted that same year, with the older native 616-Morales ultimately being established as the character's [[archenemy]]: '''Ultimatum'''. The character was not the lead character in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' animated television series on but he was later added to the main cast, as '''Kid Arachnid''',<ref>Babos, John (August 6, 2011).

Reaction to the character varied, with some, including Spider-Man's co-creator, [[Stan Lee]], approving the creation of a positive role model for children of color. Others expressed displeasure at the replacement of Peter Parker, with ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Fox News]], and Culture Map Houston reporting that some fans viewed the decision as an attempt by Marvel Comics to exhibit [[political correctness]], and that the introduction of a minority Spider-Man was simply a [[publicity stunt]] to attract more readers,<ref name=LatinRapper>{{cite web|title=Axel Alonso: Reinventing Today's Heroes |publisher=LatinRapper.com |date=August 8, 2011 |url=http://www.latinrapper.com/axel-alonso-interview.html |access-date=August 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005173504/http://latinrapper.com/axel-alonso-interview.html |url-status=live |archive-date=October 5, 2011}}</ref><ref name=FoxNews>{{cite news|url=https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/remembering-the-first-and-forgotten-latino-spider-man |title=Remembering the First – and Forgotten – Latino Spider-Man |date=August 16, 2011 |last=Robinson |first=Bryan |publisher=[[Fox News]] Latino |access-date=August 19, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912162030/http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/lifestyle/2011/08/16/remembering-first-and-forgotten-latino-spider-man/ |archive-date=September 12, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=CultureMapHouston>{{cite web|author=Graupman, Michael|date=August 4, 2011|url=http://houston.culturemap.com/news/entertainment/08-04-11-marvel-comics-spiderman-swaps-skin-color/#slide=0|title=Publicity stunt or long overdue?

The character possesses powers similar to those of the original Spider-Man, which were derived from the bite of a spider genetically engineered by Spider-Man's nemesis [[Norman Osborn]] in an attempt to duplicate those abilities.

==Publication history==
[[File:10.15.11SaraPichelliByLuigiNovi1.jpg|thumb|Artist [[Sara Pichelli]], who designed Morales, holding a sketch of him at the 2011 [[New York Comic Con]]]]
The concept of a black [[Spider-Man]] was first discussed a few months before the [[2008 United States presidential election|November 2008 election]] of [[Barack Obama]] as [[President of the United States]]. [[Marvel Comics]]' then-editor-in-chief [[Axel Alonso]] describes the catalyst, "When we were planning 'Ultimatum,' we realized that we were standing at the brink of America electing its first [[African-American]] President and we acknowledged that maybe it was time to take a good look at one of our icons." This new Spider-Man would replace Parker as Spider-Man only in [[Ultimate Marvel]], an imprint whose storyline is set in a universe separate from the [[mainstream Marvel universe]], in which Marvel's characters were reimagined for a 21st-century audience. The replacement of Ultimate Peter Parker was considered as a possible part of the 2008–09 "[[Ultimatum (comics)|Ultimatum]]" story arc that restructured much of the Ultimate Marvel universe, but those early thoughts were abandoned because the story for that character had not yet been developed.<ref name=LatinRapper/> When Marvel's editorial staff decided that the Ultimate universe's [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Peter Parker]] would be killed in the 2011 storyline "[[Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man|Death of Spider-Man]]", the character Miles Morales was created.<ref name=USAToday2/> Although Morales is the first black Spider-Man, he marks the second time a Latino character has taken the Spider-Man identity. [[Spider-Man 2099|Miguel O'Hara]], who is of Mexican and Irish descent, was the title character in the 1990s series ''[[Spider-Man 2099]]''.<ref name=FoxNews/>

This was a reference to an unsuccessful online campaign that attempted to secure Glover an audition for the lead role in the 2012 film ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]''.

In creating the visual look for Miles, Pichelli followed her usual practice of approaching the design by giving thought to the character's personality, including the background that influenced it, and the distinctive traits that he would exhibit, such as the clothing he wears, his body language and expressions.<ref>Weiland, Jonah (October 23, 2013).

In contrasting Miles with Peter Parker, Bendis has depicted different conflicts and anxieties for the character. Right after acquiring his superhuman abilities from a spider bite at the home of his uncle, Aaron, whom Miles admires but he does not initially know is a career criminal, Miles' father, Jefferson, explains to Miles that before Miles was born, Jefferson and Aaron were thieves who spent time in prison, and that while Jefferson reformed when he got older, Aaron has not.<ref name=UltSpidey2>{{cite comic|title=Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man|issue=2|writer=Bendis, Brian Michael|artist=Pichelli, Sara|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=Nov. 2011}}</ref> According to Bendis, this gives Miles cause to wonder if the traits that lead to criminal behavior are [[Nature versus nurture|hardwired into his DNA]], leading him to question whether he is essentially a good person or not, and what his future holds for him.<ref name=CBR9.30.11>Richards, Dave (September 30, 2011).

In 2012, Morales appeared in the miniseries ''[[Spider-Men]]'', in which he encounters the Spider-Man of the mainstream Marvel universe.<ref name=USAToday2/> In June 2013, the character appeared in the climax of ''[[Age of Ultron]]'' #10, which was also written by Brian Michael Bendis. Though mostly set in the mainstream Marvel universe, or [[Earth-616]] as it is known in dialogue, the story depicts major changes to the [[space-time continuum]] as a result of the time travel on the part of characters, resulting in Miles witnessing the coming of the mainstream Marvel [[Galactus]], an entity that consumes planets, to Earth.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael (w), [[Pacheco, Carlos]] (p), Bonet, Roger (i).

Despite its initial press and critical reception, ''Ultimate Comics Spider-Man'' was not a huge hit in the [[direct market]]. By August 2013, sales on the title had slipped, and sales for the other two Ultimate titles, ''Ultimate Comics X-Men'' and ''Ultimate Comics The Ultimates'', had dropped to numbers at which mainstream Marvel titles are canceled.<ref name=ComicsAlliance/> That November, ''Ultimate Comics Spider-Man'' ended its run with issue #28, and the other two titles ended along with it, to make way for the miniseries ''Cataclysm: Ultimate Spider-Man'', one of the books in the crossover storyline "Cataclysm", in which the heroes of the Ultimate universe face the threat of the Earth-616 Galactus, and Miles is transported to the mainstream Marvel universe.<ref name=ComicsAlliance/><ref name=BleedingCool>[[Johnston, Rich]] (August 15, 2013).

Miles Morales first appeared in ''Ultimate Comics: Fallout'' #4, which was published in August 2011, in which he foils an assault by [[Kangaroo (comics)|Kangaroo]] a short time after [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Peter Parker]]'s death. He wears a Spider-Man costume similar to Parker's, but considers changing it when spectators tell him it is in "bad taste".<ref name=Fallout4>{{cite news|last=Schedeen |first=Jesse |title=Ultimate Comics: Fallout #4 Review |publisher=IGN|date=August 3, 2011 |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/118/1186020p1.html |access-date=August 20, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022200817/http://comics.ign.com/articles/118/1186020p1.html |archive-date=October 22, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=This Week In Geek: Different Shades of Spider-Man |work=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]] |date=August 16, 2011 |url=http://www.nowsaltlake.com/articles/view/1580 |access-date=August 20, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509220526/http://www.nowsaltlake.com/articles/view/1580 |archive-date=May 9, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man''===
The opening story arc of ''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'', which premiered in September 2011, is set prior to ''Ultimate Fallout'' #4, and establishes the character of Miles Morales, a grade-schooler<ref name=UltSpidey5/> who lives with his mother [[Rio Morales]],<ref name=UltSpidey8>{{cite comic|title=Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man|issue=8|writer=Bendis, Brian Michael|artist=Marquez, David|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=June 2012|page=25}}</ref><ref name=UltSpidey18>{{cite comic|title=Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man|issue=18|writer=Bendis, Brian Michael|penciller=Marquez, David|inker=Ponsor, Justin|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=Feb. 2013}} Note: Although Rio's given name was first stated by the editor on the letters page of issue #8, both it and Ganke's surname were first issued in the narrative in issue #18.</ref> a nurse,<ref name=MilesMoralesSM#1/> and his father [[Jefferson Davis (comics)|Jefferson Davis]],<ref name=UltSpidey8/> and details how he received his superhuman abilities.

Days later, Miles<ref name=UltSpidey1/> is bitten by the spider during a visit to Aaron's apartment. Morales develops superhuman abilities similar to those Peter has,<ref name=UltSpidey1/> but does not tell his parents, due to his father's distrust of superheroes,<ref name=UltSpidey2/> confiding only in his best friend [[Ganke Lee]].<ref name=UltSpidey2/><ref name=UltSpidey18/>

Miles, who wants a normal life, is unhappy about having these abilities and resistant to the idea of risking his life to engage in superheroics,<ref>{{cite comic|title=Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man|issue=3|writer=Bendis, Brian Michael|artist=Pichelli, Sara|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=Dec. 2011}}</ref> a reaction that Bendis wrote to further contrast Miles with Parker.<ref name=CBR9.30.11/> However, after witnessing Spider-Man's death at the [[Green Goblin (Ultimate Marvel character)|Green Goblin]]'s hands, the guilt-ridden Miles realizes he could have helped.

His first time out, he is confronted not only by those who feel his use of the Spider-Man costume is in bad taste,<ref name=Fallout4/><ref name=UltSpidey4/> but also by [[Spider-Woman (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Woman]] over his use of the Spider-Man identity.<ref name=UltSpidey4/> She unmasks and arrests Miles and takes him to [[S.H.I.E.L.D.#Ultimate S.H.I.E.L.D.|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] headquarters, where [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]] reveals that he knows about Miles and his family, including the criminal activity of Miles' uncle. After Miles helps S.H.I.E.L.D. subdue the escaped supervillain [[Electro (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Electro]], S.H.I.E.L.D. releases Miles and gives him a modified black-and-red version of the Spider-Man costume, which Ganke feels makes Miles "officially" the new Spider-Man.<ref name=UltSpidey5/> He also receives the blessing of the Earth-616 Peter Parker during the 2012 ''[[Spider-Men]]'' miniseries, in which Parker briefly visits the Ultimate Marvel universe and meets Miles.<ref name=SpiderMen5>{{cite comic|writer=Bendis, Brian Michael|artist=Pichelli, Sara|story=Untitled|title=Spider-Men|issue=5|date=Nov. 2012|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> After the media report the emergence of a new Spider-Man, Aaron deduces that it is Miles,<ref name=UltSpidey6-7>{{cite comic|title=Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man|issue=6–7|writer=Bendis, Brian Michael|artist=[[Samnee, Chris]]|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=March–April 2012}}</ref> and offers to train Miles and work with him. After Aaron uses Miles in his ongoing conflict with the Mexican crime lord [[Mac Gargan#Ultimate Marvel|Scorpion]], Miles realizes he is being exploited, and refuses to assist his uncle further, despite Aaron's threat to inform Jefferson of his secret. This leads to an altercation that results in the malfunction of Aaron's weapons, which explode,<ref>{{cite comic|title=Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man|issue=8–12|writer=Bendis, Brian Michael|artist=Marquez, David|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=June–Sept. 2012}}</ref> killing Aaron.<ref name=UltSpidey13/>

Bitten by a genetically engineered spider known as specimen 42, which is slightly different than the one that granted Peter Parker superhuman powers, Miles Morales possesses abilities similar to the original Spider-Man's, including enhanced strength, agility, and reflexes, the ability to adhere to walls and ceilings with his hands and feet,<ref name=UltSpidey2/><ref name=Marvel.com>{{cite web|url=https://www.marvel.com/characters/spider-man-miles-morales/in-comics|title=Miles Morales: Spider-Man|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|access-date=April 3, 2021|archive-date=September 28, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200928175300/https://www.marvel.com/characters/spider-man-miles-morales/in-comics}}</ref> and a "spider sense" that warns him of danger with a buzzing sensation in his head.<ref name=Fallout4/><ref name=UltSpidey4/> Though his strength and agility are similar to those of the original younger Spider-Man, his spider-sense is not as strong, as it only warns him of immediate danger.<ref name=CBR9.30.11/>

He has two abilities that the original Spider-Man does not have: the ability to camouflage himself, including his clothing, to match his surroundings, making him effectively invisible,<ref name=CBR9.30.11/><ref name=UltSpidey1/> and a "venom strike" that can temporarily paralyze almost anyone with just a touch.<ref name=UltSpidey2/> The venom strike does not employ actual [[venom]], but is a type of [[directed energy]] that can be conducted through Miles' gloves,<ref name=UltSpidey5/> and can be used against an opponent at a distance by conducting it through a material in which both Miles and his opponent are in contact, such as the webbing of the [[Earth-616]]'s Spider-Man.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=Bendis, Brian Michael|artist=Pichelli, Sara|story=Untitled|title=Spider-Men|issue=2|date=Aug.  2012|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> It can break chains being used to restrain Miles<ref name=SpiderManV2#5>{{cite comic|writer=Bendis, Brian Michael|artist=Pichelli, Sara|story=Untitled|title=Spider-Men|issue=5|volume=2|date=June 2016|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> and even repel non-ferrous objects, such as plastic [[Lego]] bricks.<ref name=UltSpidey2/> The venom strike is powerful enough to render unconscious a person as large as [[Hank Pym]]'s [[Giant-Man]].<ref>{{cite comic|title=Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man|issue=18|writer=Bendis, Brian Michael|artist=Marquez, David|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=March 2013}}</ref> It is powerful enough to drive away the [[symbiotic]] villain [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] during Miles' first encounter with the creature,<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael (w), Pichelli, Sara (a).

''Spider-Man'' vol. 2, #21 (Dec.  2017). Marvel Comics.</ref> but also destroy thick ropes and chains that have been used to restrain him. This application of the strike leaves him "dizzy and useless",<ref name=SpiderManV2#235/> and cannot be used multiple times in rapid succession without a "recharging" period for Miles, though he can still make use of the conventional strike against people during this period.<ref name=SpiderMen2#1/><ref name=SpiderManV2#5/> The conventional venom strike is mostly useless against the supervillain [[Armadillo (comics)|Armadillo]], but during Miles' encounter with that villain, his venom blast manifests itself in a form similar to Miles' webbing, and Miles uses it like a lasso to pull Armadillo towards him and knock him unconscious with a venom strike-powered punch.<ref name=SpiderManV2#235/>

Miles' body also possesses a significant resistance to injury. During an altercation with the Roxxon mercenary [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]], Miles is thrown through a brick wall without any apparent serious injury, though the experience is painful for him.<ref name=Marvel.com/><ref>{{cite comic|title=Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man|issue=27|writer=Bendis, Brian Michael|artist=Marquez, David|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=November 2013}}</ref>

Miles wears a costume given to him by S.H.I.E.L.D.,<ref name=UltSpidey5/> and initially uses Peter Parker's web shooters, which are given to him by May Parker.<ref name=UltSpidey14/> He is eventually given a new set of webshooters by S.H.I.E.L.D. as well.<ref name=UltSpidey23/>

Radio host and conservative pundit [[Lou Dobbs]] expressed outrage over the original Spider-Man being replaced by Morales, stating during a television commentary, "Peter Parker, who was a white orphan from Queens, was killed off in June during a fight with his nemesis, the Green Goblin…Marvel Comics saying it’s replacing the iconic character with Miles Morales, who is part Latino and part Black."

In a review for the first issue, David Pepose of [[Newsarama]] wrote, "The biggest victory that Bendis scores with Miles Morales is that he makes us care about him, and care about him quickly. Even though we're still scratching the surface of what makes him tick, we're seeing the world through his eyes, and it's similar to Peter Parker's but a whole lot tougher.

Bendis never quite paints a complete picture of Miles—his thoughts, motivations, personality quirks, and so forth. Miles is largely a reactionary figure throughout the book as he confronts struggles like registering for a charter school or dealing with family squabbles." Schedeen also opined that "Miles occupies a more urban, racially diverse, and tense landscape. All the story doesn't pander or lean too heavily on elements like racial and economic tension to move forward. Miles is simply a character who speaks to a slightly different teen experience, and one not nearly as well represented in superhero comics as Peter's".<ref>{{cite web|last=Schedeen|first=Jesse|title=Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man #1 Review|publisher=IGN|date=September 14, 2011|url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/119/1194252p1.html|access-date=June 8, 2012|archive-date=January 7, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107121236/http://comics.ign.com/articles/119/1194252p1.html|url-status=live}}</ref> James Hunt of [[CBR.com]] rated the issue #1 four and a half out of five stars, lauding Bendis for emphasizing Morales' character and his supporting cast instead of rushing him into costume.<ref>Hunt, James (September 14, 2011).

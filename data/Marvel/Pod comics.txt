He was permanently slain later on Earth-238 by [[Fury (Marvel Comics)|The Fury]]. Jackdaw was literally torn in half by one of the Fury's energy bolts and expired shortly thereafter in Captain Britain's arms. Jackdaw expressed a belief that Merlyn would resurrect him. [[Saturnyne]] had abandoned them (and her assistant Dimples, who loved her deeply) to escape.<ref>[[The Mighty World of Marvel|Marvel Super-Heroes]] (July 1982)[http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-super-heroes-a-crooked-world/37-157574/ #387]</ref> Merlyn did not resurrect Jackdaw as it would have damaged his chances of rescuing Captain Britain, who was killed as well by the Fury after Dimples and Jackdaw, and resurrected by Merlyn back on Earth-616.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicvine.com/jackdaw/29-32268/|title=Jackdaw (Character) - Comic Vine|website=Comic Vine}}</ref>

The Skull intended to take over first [[New York City]], then the world. Along with the Skull's other slaves, he was forced to fight a team of super-mutants led by [[Captain America]]; in the end, the Skull was killed and his slaves were freed.

Jade Dragon would move on to work alongside [[Iron Maiden (Marvel Comics)|Iron Maiden]], [[Black Bolt]], and the [[Iron Avengers]].

As part of his transformation by the mist, Jade Dragon gained functional wings with the ability to fly and the ability to blow jade-green flames from his mouth.

===Jiang Li in film===
[[Ying Li (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ying Li]] appears in ''[[Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings]]'', portrayed by [[Fala Chen]].  In the film, Li is a guardian of [[Ta Lo]], a mystical realm inhabited by Chinese mythological creatures, including its guardian [[Chinese dragon|dragon]], the [[Great Protector]], who blesses Li with the power to manipulate wind.  In 1996, the immortal warlord [[Wenwu|Xu Wenwu]] attempts to invade Ta Lo but is defeated by Li.  The two fall in love but when Wenwu is rejected by Ta Lo's inhabitants for his dark past, Li leaves with him.  The two marry and have two children: son [[Shang-Chi (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Shang-Chi]] and daughter [[Xialing]].  Wenwu abandons his [[Ten Rings (organization)|organization]] and [[Ten Rings (object)|weapons]] while Li forgoes the blessing of the Great Protector to be with each other and their children.  While Wenwu is away, Li is murdered by the Iron Gang, old enemies of the Ten Rings.  Li's death prompts Wenwu to violently murder the gang in retaliation and reverts back to his dark ways by reclaiming his Rings and organization.  Years later, the [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Dweller-in-Darkness|Dweller-in-Darkness]] uses Li's voice to make Wenwu believe that his wife is still alive and trapped within a gate in Ta Lo, so that Wenwu can use his Rings to destroy its seal.  Wenwu attempts to convince his estranged children to help him free their mother and destroy her village in retaliation for imprisoning her, but the two side with Li's people.

After the battle, Shang-Chi and Xialing light paper lanterns in memory of Li and Wenwu, who was killed by the Dweller.

===Jiang Li in comics===
Jiang Li made her comic book debut in ''Shang-Chi'' Vol 2 #4 (Sep. 2021), created by [[Gene Luen Yang]] and Dike Ruan.  Jiang Li was born into one of [[Ta-Lo]]'s few communities of mortals known as the Qilin Riders who were appointed by the [[Xian (Taoism)|Xian]] as guardians of the gateway connecting Ta-Lo to Qilin Island in the [[East China Sea]].  While on patrol, Jiang Li rescued a shipwrecked [[Zheng Zu]] from pirates. Jiang Li nursed Zu back to health and the two fell in love. However, Jiang Li's father, Chieftain Xin, was outraged over her harboring an outsider and ordered her to return to Ta-Lo with Zu's head. Instead, Jiang Li and Zu fled to Zu's House of the Deadly Hand in [[Hunan]], where Jiang Li discovered Zu's true identity as the leader of the [[Five Weapons Society]], a criminal organization. Jiang Li attempted to leave him, but Zu pleaded with her to stay, promising to change his dark ways. True to his word, Zu rediscovered his own humanity from Jiang Li and the two married and had two children: Shang-Chi and Shi-Hua.<ref name="ReferenceA">''Shang-Chi'' vol. 2 #7 Marvel Comics</ref>  However following an attack by [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] against the House of the Deadly Hand, Zu became cold and distant towards his family, as he felt that his love for them made him weak.  Out of loneliness, Jiang Li sent a letter to her father and a few weeks later was drawn to a confrontation between Xin and Zu in the latter's personal tower, where it was revealed that Zu had constructed a makeshift portal to Ta Lo to steal the realm's sacred weapons to bolster the Society.  While Zu fought his wife and father-in-law, Shang-Chi happened upon the scene, just as the portal's connection to Ta Lo became disconnected and Jiang Li was accidentally pushed through to her presumed death.<ref name="ReferenceB">''Shang-Chi'' vol. 2 #8 Marvel Comics</ref>

Instead, Jiang Li was sent to the [[Negative Zone]], where she used her psionic abilities to mentally link with the native [[mantid]] creatures, who protected and sheltered her.  Jiang Li resided in the Negative Zone for many years, occasionally using her psionic abilities to reach out to her children.  After Shang-Chi took over the Five Weapons Society following Zu's death and began reforming it as a heroic organization, he began receiving Jiang Li's messages through his dreams and travelled to the Negative Zone with his half-siblings to rescue her.  While she recuperated at the New House of the Deadly Hand in [[Chinatown, Manhattan]], she is secretly visited by her father.  Despite claiming to being overjoyed to see her again, Xin is consumed by his rage towards Zu and his bloodline since his earlier confrontation with them and believes Shang-Chi to be as evil as his father, vowing to put an end to his grandson.<ref>''Shang-Chi'' vol. 2 #4 Marvel Comics</ref>

Due to being mentally linked to insects for many years, Jiang Li takes a while to recover her mental health but spends time with her son and his half-siblings.<ref>''Shang-Chi'' vol. 2 #5 Marvel Comics</ref><ref>''Shang-Chi'' vol. 2 #6 Marvel Comics</ref>  After she fully recovers, Jiang Li begins telling Shang-Chi their family history but the two are attacked by several enemies of the Society.  Jiang Li uses her psionic abelites to realize that they are being led by Xin.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>  Although Shang-Chi and the Society are able to defeat the would-be assassins, Jiang Li is taken hostage by them, forcing Shang-Chi to let them escape.  Although Xin is outraged over their failure to kill Shang-Chi and for kidnapping his daughter, he allows his allies to escape with Jiang Li through a portal to Qilin Island and through the gateway to Ta Lo.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>  After failing to acquire Shang-Chi's corpse to complete his magic, Xin forcibly extracts Jiang Li's psionic energy to locate Shi-Hua for his ritual.<ref>''Shang-Chi'' vol. 2 #9 Marvel Comics</ref>  Xin returns with Shi-Hua's severed right hand, which he uses to create ''[[taotie]]'' masks for himself and the Qilin Riders.  Jiang Li escapes by psionically bonding with a nearby qilin and travels back to Earth to help the Society defend the House of the Deadly Hand from the mask empowered Riders.<ref>''Shang-Chi'' vol. 2 #11 Marvel Comics</ref>  Jiang Li briefly faces off against her father, who is empowered by his own mask and several of the heavenly [[Mandarin's rings#Ten Rings (Ta-Lo)|Ten Rings]] but helped by the arrival of Shang-Chi and his siblings.  When Shang-Chi succumbs to his inner darkness to take the Ten Rings from Xin and defeats him and the Riders, he attempts to sever Xin's hand in retaliation for what he did to Shi-Hua but Jiang Li and his siblings talk him down, bringing him back to his senses.  Jiang Li and Shang-Chi return to Ta Lo for Xin to face justice and to return the Ten Rings to the Jade Emperor, who appoints Jiang Li as the new Chieftain of the Qilin Riders, which requires her to remain in Ta Lo.<ref>''Shang-Chi'' vol. 2 #12 Marvel Comics</ref>

===Powers and Abilities===
As a Qilin Rider, Jiang Li is blessed by the [[Xian (Taoism)|Xian]] with the power of innate [[archery]] and to [[Telepathy|psionically link]] with [[qilin]].  Jiang Li can also extend her psionic abilities to other individuals, including humans and aliens.  She is also proficient in martial arts.

'''Raymond''' "'''Piranha'''" '''Jones''' is a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[Marvel Comics]], primarily as a foe of [[Luke Cage]].

The character first appeared in ''[[Luke Cage, Power Man]]'' #30 (April 1976), created by writer [[Don McGregor]] and artists [[Rich Buckler]], [[Arvell Jones|Arv Jones]] and [[Keith Pollard]]. Ray Jones grew up in poverty and lost all of his teeth by the age of 15, and had them replaced with long, sharpened steel spikes. These, and his habit of using them on his enemies, gained him the nickname "Piranha". He became a criminal at an early age, and eventually allied with [[Cockroach Hamilton|Dontrell "Cockroach" Hamilton]].

===Piranha Jones in other media===
* Piranha appears in the ''[[Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'' episode "To Steal an Ant Man". This version has had not just his teeth, but his entire mandible replaced with a mechanical metal jaw. He is one of the henchmen of gangster [[Crossfire (comics)|William Cross]]. Jones bites Luke Cage's arm, only to break his teeth on Cage's impervious flesh.
* Raymond "Piranha" Jones appears in the second season of ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]'', portrayed by [[Chaz Lamar Shepherd]]. The son of one of Mama Mabel Stokes's prostitutes, he is a [[Wall Street]] [[broker]] who tries to help [[Mariah Dillard]] sell her gun-dealing business by helping her invest in Atreus Plastics through insider trading. Because of this, the origins of his nickname are changed, which he explains comes from considering himself the sort of "little fish you don't see coming" in the cutthroat world of stock trading. When Luke gets sued for beating up Cockroach, he is encouraged by [[Foggy Nelson]] to attend a party hosted by Piranha, who is a big fan of Luke and keeps a lot of his memorabilia in his office. The party is attacked by members of [[Bushmaster (Marvel Comics)|Bushmaster]]'s gang, and Luke flees with Piranha,<ref>{{cite episode|title=All Souled Out|series=Marvel's Luke Cage|credits=Lemmons, Kasi (director); Ian Stokes (writer)|network=[[Netflix]]|airdate=June 22, 2018|season=2|number=5}}</ref> hiding him out in an abandoned theater. During this time, Luke gets Piranha to open up and reveal his role in the insider trading, and he also reveals a bit about his childhood, giving Luke the realization that he should consider making amends with his father, whom he has been at odds with since the start of the season.

==Joseph==
'''Joseph''' was briefly a member of the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Scott Lobdell]] and artist [[Roger Cruz]], he first appeared in ''The [[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #327 (Dec. 1995).

Joseph is a [[Human cloning|clone]] of the X-Men's nemesis [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], possessing his [[magnetism|magnetic]] powers, though he was originally intended to be an [[amnesia]]c Magneto. He had a brief courtship with [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] before dying in battle with the actual Magneto. Joseph is later revived by [[Astra (Marvel Comics)|Astra]].

===Fictional character biography===
[[Image:Joseph (Magneto's Clone).jpg|thumb|130px|left|Illustration of Joseph by Gus Vazquez]]
Joseph was discovered near a South American orphanage run by a nun known as Sister Maria. After several run-ins with "The Colonel", Joseph opted to leave the orphanage to protect the children. It was shortly after this that he encountered [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and saved her from the first wave of [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]]'s "[[Operation: Zero Tolerance|Operation Zero Tolerance]]".<ref>''X-Men Unlimited'' #11</ref> Rogue believed Joseph to be an amnesiac and mysteriously youthful Magneto. During this time, the [[X-Men]] first encountered the being known as [[Onslaught (Marvel Comics)|Onslaught]]. Believing Magneto to be responsible, the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] sought Joseph out and figured out that he was not responsible nor was he like Magneto.<ref>''The Avengers'' #401</ref> Out of guilt for what he believed were his past sins, Joseph joined the X-Men in their war against Onslaught.{{issue|date=September 2021}}

In an attempt to find out more about his past, Joseph encountered the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]] and their leader [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]]. They too believed that Joseph was Magneto and begged him to lead them. Exodus turned on Joseph when he noticed that Joseph was not the Magneto he knew. Joseph took on the identity of Magneto in order to convince the Acolytes that he truly was Magneto and ordered them to abandon their current activities. Exodus disagreed, but obeyed because he believed he saw a glimmer of the old Magneto within Joseph. Joseph returned to the X-Men, satisfied that he no longer was Magneto.<ref>''Magneto'' #1-4 (1996)</ref>

Shortly afterward, Joseph dedicated himself to reconstructing the [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#Z|Z'nox]] chamber to give Rogue some control over her powers. It was successful, to an extent, in that while standing under it, Rogue was unable to absorb the powers or psyche of another person. Immediately after this, Joseph and some of the X-Men were sent to the [[Shi'ar|Shi'ar Galaxy]] in order to fight [[Phalanx (comics)|The Phalanx]]. When they returned to Earth, they were captured. In captivity, Joseph met the mutant [[Maggott]], who had been saved by Magneto years before, and expressed his gratitude to the confused Joseph. Maggott discovered though that their captor [[Erik the Red (comics)|Erik the Red]] was the real Magneto in disguise. Feeling that he owed Magneto for saving him, he did not tell the X-Men that Joseph was not Magneto.{{issue|date=September 2021}}

Several weeks later, the Israeli agent [[Sabra (comics)|Sabra]] appeared at the X-Mansion and wanted to kill "Magneto". Maggott revealed to her that Joseph wasn't Magneto, confirming Sabra's suspicions. Joseph left with Sabra to find out more about his past and Magneto's current whereabouts. He was kidnapped by [[Astra (Marvel Comics)|Astra]], who told Joseph his true origin where she was his creator by cloning him from Magneto's DNA. Astra sent Joseph against Magneto, who had publicly revealed himself. These events came to be known as the ''Magneto War''. During this ''Magneto War'', Joseph appeared to have sacrificed himself in order to repair the damage done by Magneto to Earth's electromagnetic field.<ref>''X-Men'' #87</ref>

However, Astra revived Joseph, and implanted a record of Magneto's old memories, causing him to think as the true master of magnetism once did. Joseph announces his comeback by murdering 40 anti-mutant campaigners while wearing Magneto's costume, leaving the real Magneto to take the blame. Joseph has also assembled his version of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] consisting of himself, Astra, and mutated versions of [[Blob (comics)|Blob]], [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]], [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], [[Scarlet Witch]], and [[Toad (Marvel Comics)|Toad]]. It is soon revealed that the mutated versions of Blob, Mastermind, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch, and Toad are clones created by Astra. All the clones were killed by Magneto. Joseph is defeated by Magneto and remanded to [[Asteroid M|Utopia]]'s X-Brig.<ref>''Magneto: Not a Hero'' #1–4</ref>

====Death====
After the destruction of Utopia in the war between the [[AvX|Avengers and X-Men]], [[Danger Room|Danger]] released all prisoners on the X-Brig, including Joseph. After the loss of Magneto, Joseph disguised himself as the Master of Magnetism and formed a new Brotherhood in the wake of the death of the X-Men. He brought them to an Air Force base in East Transia to stoke fear in humankind because of the spike in anti-mutant violence. But they were confronted by a new group of X-Men led by a resurrected Cyclops. After the battle, Joseph's ruse was revealed making Juggernaut mad because he thought the group was made to protect mutants. He attacked Joseph and held him down while Scott and him talked about ideologies. But before anyone could see what was going on, Joseph was killed by [[Kwannon (Marvel Comics)|Kwannon]] who considered Joseph a threat to mutantkind.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 5 #16</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
As a clone of Magneto, Joseph possesses the superhuman power to generate extremely powerful [[magnetic field]]s. He can employ these magnetic fields to manipulate ferrous metals and to produce a number of other effects. He has also been shown to generate [[electricity]] and electromagnetic radiation. Joseph is capable of personal levitation/flight at high speeds, and often produces a protective magnetic aura around his own body. The real Magneto has on rare occasions been able to produce a wormhole using magnetism, and to safely teleport himself and others by means of the wormhole, but Joseph has not demonstrated a similar ability. It was revealed that the circumstances of his creation mean that he lacks the mental barriers that the original Magneto has established over the years to prevent himself from over-using his powers, with the result that Joseph can manipulate more energy than Magneto is capable of controlling on his own (Magneto requiring technological assistance to boost his powers to the same level as Joseph's full potential), at the cost of causing significant damage to Joseph if he pushes himself too far.

==Josiah X==
'''Josiah X''' is a [[fictional character]], the son of [[Isaiah Bradley]], the black Captain America, and the uncle of [[Elijah Bradley]], the Patriot.<ref name="Young Avengers Vol. 1 #8">''Young Avengers'' #8.</ref> The character was created by [[Christopher Priest (comic book writer)|Christopher Priest]] and [[Joe Bennett (penciller)|Joe Bennett]], and debuted in ''[[The Crew (comics)|The Crew]]'' #1.

Josiah is a [[Muslim]] minister. He replaced his last name Bradley with the letter "X". He has had many names including "Justice", the one he used as a hero. The "X" apparently symbolizes his allegiance to the [[Tribe of Shabazz|Lost Tribe of Shabazz]]. Josiah runs a Muslim Mission in the "Mog" (Little Mogadishu) in [[Brooklyn, New York]].{{issue|date=April 2013}}

As depicted in the series ''[[Truth: Red, White & Black]]'', the World War II [[Weapon Plus|Super Soldier program]] of 1942, operated by "Reinstein", used [[African American]] test subjects in a beta phase. The clandestine experimentation that empowered Josiah's father [[Isaiah Bradley]] held similarities with the [[Tuskegee Syphilis Study|Tuskegee Experiments]]. After a failed suicide mission to destroy the Super-Soldier efforts of the Nazis, Isaiah was court-martialed and imprisoned. While he was in prison, the government attempted to use his altered DNA to create another Super-Soldier. After 39 attempts they had a single success, which was Josiah. His surrogate mother smuggled him out from the government's watchful eye.

Josiah grew up alone in a Catholic orphanage outside of Boston. His powers revealed themselves when he lashed out at one of the orphanage nuns while in his early teens. Believing he had accidentally killed Sister Irenia, he fled. Under the assumed name of Josiah Smith he entered the U.S. Army.{{issue|date=April 2013}}

[[Image:Josiahrescue.png|thumb|130px|left|Illustration of Josiah Bradley by [[Joe Bennett (penciller)|Joe Bennett]]]]
Josiah served several tours in the [[Vietnam War]], becoming a seasoned and experienced veteran. His unit, made up of primarily black soldiers, were nearly killed on a mission by an inconsiderate and racist officer's order to bomb the area while they were still on patrol. His assault on the heartless officer was rewarded with a court martial. Josiah was sent back to the States to serve out his sentence in [[Fort Leavenworth]], a stateside [[military prison]].{{issue|date=April 2013}}

Blood tests at a secret research facility in [[Berkeley, California]] proved he was the missing Super-Soldier baby. His [[surrogate mother]] was brought in to confirm a genetic match, and she again helped him to escape. She also told him the truth about his past and the real first names of his genetic parents.{{issue|date=April 2013}}

It was a long four years later before he could act on this knowledge. He came across a list of African-American individuals abused by the Super-Soldier project, and used it to find his parents' full names and their location.{{issue|date=April 2013}}

After meeting his real parents, Josiah left the US and traveled abroad as a private military contractor and adventurer; he eventually ended up on the continent of [[Africa]]. It was in Africa that Josiah discovered the [[Islam|Islamic faith]] and decided to use it to find a purpose for his life.{{issue|date=April 2013}}

Josiah became involved with [[War Machine|James Rhodes']] clandestine "[[The Crew (comics)|Crew]]" after they were tricked into believing he was a criminal. After the usual superhero fight, Josiah joined them in order to seek out those who had not only framed him, but had also turned his neighborhood into a war zone.{{issue|date=April 2013}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://phonogram.us/comics/crew/start.htm |title=digital-priest.com: The Crew |publisher=Phonogram.us |access-date=2011-01-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525134513/http://phonogram.us/comics/crew/start.htm |archive-date=2011-05-25 }}</ref>

When [[Iron Lad]] forms the [[Young Avengers]], he attempts to recruit Josiah, but instead recruits his nephew [[Patriot (comics)|Elijah Bradley]] when Josiah is unavailable.<ref name="Young Avengers Vol. 1 #8"/>

Due to his unique genetic makeup, Josiah has aged very slowly. Although he is well over fifty years old, he appears to be twenty-five. His genetic code was manipulated with great precision to compensate for the side effects of unrefined Super Soldier serum. Josiah is extremely strong (able to bench press over 1100 pounds) and his body possesses phenomenal endurance. Because of his many years on the run from the U.S. government, Josiah has experience and training as both a soldier and mercenary. He also has decades of experience with a variety of martial arts styles, languages and weapons.

Josiah carries the scarred battle shield belonging to his father and predecessor [[Isaiah Bradley|Isaiah]], similar to one used by Steve Rogers before receiving his vibranium-steel shield. It is an unpainted concave triangular metal shield with the [[Double V campaign|Double V for Victory]] design. For protection he wears a loose chain mesh shirt over light padding.{{Issue|date=October 2018}} This mesh shirt is capable of blunting the impact of most small arms fire.

==Joystick==
'''Joystick''' is a fictional character created by [[Marvel Comics]]. She is the villainous alter ego of Janice Yanizeski. She debuted in ''The Amazing Scarler-Spider'' #2 (Dec. 1995), designed by artist [[Mark Bagley]].

Joystick is a participant of "The Great Game", a competition between costumed individuals sponsored by wealthy executives. When she is first introduced, she presents her "monitor" with the mask of fellow participant El Toro Negro. She is assigned a match in New York against Scarlet Spider. Joystick goes to the Daily Bugle looking for reporter Ken Ellis. She meets Phil Urich (without his costume). Scarlet Spider follows Ellis and is ambushed by Joystick. Phil Urich (as Green Goblin) saves Ellis as Ben Reilly still fights the woman. Meanwhile, in Paris, El Toro Negro attacks Joystick's "monitor", seeking revenge against her.<ref>''The Amazing Scarlet Spider'' #2 (Dec. 1995). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Phil Urich, the heroic Green Goblin, develops something of a crush on Joystick, a participant of "The Great Game". He dons the costume and visits Joystick's hotel room, where a package is assigned to "Scarlet Spider". He opens it anyway and receives a dose of some kind of gas. Somewhere else, Joystick takes notice of the hotel room situation in her van and learns El Toro Negro is after her as payback for his defeat. Green Goblin is attacked by Joystick, until El Toro Negro surprises them. Scarlet Spider soon arrives to defeat El Toro Negro while Phil Urich saves Joystick. Scarlet Spider scolds the Green Goblin for letting her go.<ref>''Green Goblin'' #3 (Dec. 1995). Marvel Comics.</ref>

She is later seen in the ''Return of Kaine'' arc of the ''[[Clone Saga]]'', fighting again against Ben Reilly (then under the Spider-Man identity) and his clone Kaine, with nPolestar. Ben Reilly jumps to defend Kaine and Muse against their assailants. Kaine defeats Rhino as Ben destroys Joystick's weapons and beats Polestar.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #409 (March 1996). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, she once again attacks Ben Reily when he invades a facility's installations. Soon after, when Ben Reilly stops an attempt on Jonah Jameson's life (courtesy of El Toro Negro), an all-out brawl happens between the three and mercenaries Chance and [[Cardiac (comics)|Cardiac]]. During a fierce melee battle, El Toro Negro unveils his role in the conspiracy to a beaten Joystick: he assumed the role of a rogue player in the game to divert attention to the hostile takeovers happening backstage. Joystick confesses that, despite the false pretenses of El Toro Negro's role, she still defeated him and took his mask.<ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited'' #14 (Nov. 1996). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Joystick much later becomes a member of the New Thunderbolts.<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' #1 (2005).</ref>

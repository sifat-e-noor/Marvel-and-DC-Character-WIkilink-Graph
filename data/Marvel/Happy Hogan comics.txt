'''Harold Joseph''' "'''Happy'''" '''Hogan''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is usually depicted as a [[supporting character]] in stories featuring [[Iron Man|Iron Man / Tony Stark]], for whom he works as a [[chauffeur]], [[bodyguard]], and [[personal assistant]]. Happy is close friends with his employer, and is among the first people in the [[Marvel Universe]] to discover his identity as the armored superhero. He is also the father of the [[Teen Abomination]], and was married to [[Pepper Potts]]. Hogan earned the ironic nickname "Happy" during his boxing days from his reluctance to smile.

Director [[Jon Favreau]] portrays [[Happy Hogan (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Happy Hogan]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008), ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010), ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' (2013), ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017), ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (both 2019), and ''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]'' (2021). Favreau also voices alternate reality versions of the character in the [[Disney+]] animated series ''[[What If...? (TV series)|What If...?]]'' (2021).

==Publication history==
Created by writers [[Stan Lee]] and [[Robert Bernstein (comics)|Robert Bernstein]] and artist [[Don Heck]], Happy Hogan first appeared in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #45 (Sept. 1963).<ref>{{cite book |last=Wells |first=John |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1960-64 |date=2015 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490458 |page=135}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
A former boxer with a history of losing fights, Hogan is hired by [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] as his [[chauffeur]] and [[personal assistant]] after Happy saves Tony's life. While hospitalized after being beaten up by a supervillain called the [[Unicorn (Marvel Comics)|Unicorn]], he had an allergic reaction to [[Flower|flowers]].<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' Vol. 1 #56 (August 1964)</ref> Happy learns that Tony is Iron Man.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #70. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Then, a desperately ill Happy is mutated into a giant, savage, nearly mindless, superhumanly strong humanoid known as the '''[[Freak (Marvel Comics)|Freak]]''' when doctors try to cure him using a [[cobalt]] ray machine powered by Stark's experimental "Enervator" device. The Freak breaks loose and goes on a rampage, escaping before Iron Man can arrive to stop him.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #74. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Iron Man leads the Freak back to his laboratory, but runs out of power and collapses. The Freak encounters [[Pepper Potts]], who faints at the sight of him, and he carries her away. The police fire on him, causing him to drop Pepper. Iron Man saves Pepper, and leads the Freak to his lab again. He is restored to his normal self in ''Tales of Suspense'' #76 (April 1966) when Iron Man exposes him to the Enervator once again, though he is afflicted with temporary [[amnesia]] that lasts until ''Tales of Suspense'' #83 (November 1966).<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #76-83. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, while helping Iron Man rebuild his armor, Happy is again exposed to cobalt rays and is again transformed into the Freak. The Freak smashes Iron Man through a wall, and takes Pepper with him. Iron Man is able to again return Happy to normal.<ref>''Iron Man'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The [[Collector (comics)|Collector]] later kidnaps Happy and Pepper, hoping to add the Freak to his collection. This draws Iron Man's attention, who intervenes and rescues his friends.<ref>''Iron Man'' #26. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, after Happy is injured while wearing the Iron Man armor,<ref>''Iron Man'' #81. Marvel Comics.</ref> Stark uses the Enervator to save him, thinking that he has corrected the problems with the device. But again it transforms Happy into the Freak, who goes on another rampage. He exposes himself to cobalt radiation, causing him to glow with cobalt energy that will eventually reach critical mass and cause him to explode. The two battle, until Stark is able to use the Enervator to again revert Happy to normal, apparently for the last time.<ref>''Iron Man'' #84-85. Marvel Comics.</ref>

He [[Marriage|marries]] Pepper Potts in ''Tales of Suspense'' #91 (July 1967), but they later [[divorce]].{{issue|date=April 2012}}

Happy has worked for almost all of Stark's companies, including [[Stark Industries]], [[Stark Enterprises]] and [[Stark Solutions]]. However, when Tony/Iron Man disappears during the ''[[Onslaught (Marvel Comics)|Onslaught]]'' saga, Hogan refuses to be employed by [[Rumiko Fujikawa|Stark-Fujikawa]], but is re-employed when Stark returns. He also remarries Pepper Potts.{{issue|date=April 2012}}

With the events of the 2006 "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" storyline causing Tony Stark considerable moral, political and emotional problems, Happy Hogan continues to give Tony much needed advice. In an important moment of crisis, he says to Tony: "You, my friend, are the only cape in the bunch [of superheroes] that's both one of us [that is, human] and one of them. Who else can see both sides the way you do?" On the night of his anniversary with Pepper, Hogan is attacked by the [[Spymaster (comics)|Spymaster]], who is seeking to use Hogan as bait to draw out Iron Man. The Spymaster threatens to kill Hogan first, then Pepper. Angered, Hogan grabs him by the neck and they fall several stories,<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 4 #13. Marvel Comics.</ref> leaving Hogan in a [[vegetative coma]].<ref name="IM414">''Iron Man'' vol. 4 #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>

While he is in the coma, Pepper tells Tony of Cobra McCoyle, a former boxing friend who took too many hits to the head. Cobra is unable to even feed himself and must be taken care of. Pepper tells Tony that Hogan has declared he never wants to end up like McCoyle. At the end of ''Iron Man'' vol. 4 #14, Hogan apparently dies. The issue leaves it ambiguous whether Hogan dies naturally or whether it is because Tony Stark digitally interfaced with and shut down Hogan's [[life support]].<ref name="IM414"/>

Following this, Tony experiences occasional hallucinations of Happy, which [[Doc Samson]] attributes to the [[Extremis]] process; as a result of Tony's mind being accelerated by the Extremis process to allow him to interface with his armor directly; his subconscious mind often processes information that he was not consciously aware of, with this information being 'filtered' by the part of Tony's mind that stored his guilt to stop him facing it, resulting in illusions of Happy or Steve Rogers appearing to prompt Tony to acknowledge key information that he had not registered himself.<ref>''Iron Man'' (vol. 4) #25. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, when Tony (slowly losing his mind to prevent [[Norman Osborn]] from getting the Superhero Registration Act information) and Pepper are in hiding, Pepper reminds him of all his friends and allies, with Happy being one of them. Tony then replies, "Who's Happy?"

After experiencing a [[AXIS (comics)|moral inversion]], Tony is confronted by a new, [[Teen Abomination|teenage version of]] the [[Abomination (character)|Abomination]] when he relocates to San Francisco. While talking with the Teen Abomination, Tony learns that he is Jamie Carlson, the son of former Stark Industries employee Katrina Carlson who was exposed to gamma radiation during an accident at the company when Tony was busy fighting a wizard from another dimension during an earlier time. Initially planning to analyze and use the Teen Abomination's powers for himself, Tony changes his mind when the analysis of the boy's DNA reveals that Happy Hogan was his father, leaving Tony resolving to heal the boy, as Happy was one of the few people he ever respected.<ref>''Superior Iron Man'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Iron Man 2020 (event)|Iron Man 2020]]" event, Pepper is introduced to an off the grid navigation incorporated in the Rescue armor that Tony previously developed before Y2K called H.A.P.P.Y. (short for Host Analogue Program Pre-Y2K) where its personality is modeled after Happy Hogan. While having been programmed to not fall under the control of the [[A.I. Army]], H.A.P.P.Y. helped Pepper in "rebuilding" Tony who was operating as Mark 1.<ref>''Rescue 2020'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As the Freak, Happy possesses unnatural strength, surpassing this by a hundred. His skin is so tough that almost nothing can hurt him.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' Vol. #75 (March 1966)</ref> He has the ability to absorb cobalt energy and increase his power. In this form, he could discharge it from his hands into blasts. He can also release lethal radioactive levels to create [[Nuclear explosion|nuclear explosions]].<ref>''Iron Man'' Vol. 1 #84 (March 1976)</ref> But as Happy, he got skills in unarmed combat, especially [[boxing]].

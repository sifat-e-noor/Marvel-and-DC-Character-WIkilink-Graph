==Eli Bard==
'''Eli Bard''' aka '''Eliphas''' is a [[fictional]] [[Character (arts)|character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Christopher Yost]], [[Clayton Crain]] and [[Craig Kyle]], Bard is a member of the [[Purifiers (Marvel Comics)|Purifiers]] and an enemy of the [[X-Men]].

Eli Bard was born "Eliphas" at the height of the [[Roman Empire]]. He was recognized as an outstanding soldier until a spear injury ended his military career. For a while he worked unsuccessfully as a poet until he met Aurelia, one of the most powerful women in Rome. He soon married her and achieved a position in the Senate. As a well-respected senator, he was known as a great orator and a friend to the army. His wife left him for a general named Mascius and conspired to give Mascius his seat in the Senate.<ref name="X-Force #11 March 2009">''X-Force'' #11 (March, 2009)</ref>

Left with nothing, Eliphas was approached by [[Selene (comics)|Selene]], who offered him immortality in exchange for helping her kill and absorb every soul in Rome. Eliphas drew [[pentagram]]s and performed rituals at several locations in the city, but warned a small girl to get her family out. The girl's father alerted the authorities and Eliphas and Selene were captured before the spell could be carried out. Just before they were [[burned at the stake]], Selene killed the guards. She cursed Eliphas for his perceived betrayal with an eternal life of torture, turning him into a vampire-like creature. Eliphas was buried alive for 700 years until a farmer discovered him in his field. Eliphas killed the farmer with a swift bite to the jugular. He spent the next several hundred years searching for Selene. He ran into the ancestral [[Apache]] tribe of [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]]. They recognized him as a vampire but could not stop him from wiping out almost the entire tribe.<ref name="X-Force #11 March 2009"/>

Eliphas, having at some point in time changed his name to "Eli Bard," finally located Selene in [[Nova Roma (disambiguation)|Nova Roma]], where she was worshiped as a god. Still in love with her despite her curse, Bard realized that he must make an offering to her before approaching her. Bard later joined the Purifiers, an anti-mutant terrorist group. During this time, he worked diligently to further the Purifiers' goals. Secretly, however, he had hoped to sacrifice thousands of Purifiers' souls using the same ritual from Rome to gain Selene's attention. He assisted in the resurrection of [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]] but the android was suspicious of him, as he had no record on him. After seeing Bastion reprogram an offspring of Magus, he changed his plan and instead re-animated the corpses in the burial grounds of the Apache tribe that he had decimated decades earlier using the [[Techno-organic virus|Technarch transmode virus]] he had absorbed from an offspring of [[Magus (Technarchy)|Magus]]. Among the bodies reanimated were those of the mutants [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]] and [[Thunderbird (John Proudstar)|Thunderbird]]. He presented Caliban to Selene and stated that he intended to use Caliban's mutant tracking abilities to track down deceased mutants and reanimate them to form an army for Selene, an offer which she accepted.<ref name="X-Force #11 March 2009"/>

He uses the virus to resurrect a variety of mutants, including [[Cypher (Marvel Comics)|Cypher]], [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], the original [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]], [[Risque (comics)|Risque]], [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)|Pyro]], and [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]].

When Bard returned to Proudstar's tribe's burial grounds to resurrect Caliban and Thunderbird, the spirits of the tribe rose to protect those buried there. Bard attacked them with Selene's mystical knife, transforming them into a [[Demon Bear]]. After fleeing the battle, Bard leaves the blade behind, unaware it was pivotal in Selene's plans. He is then dispatched to Utopia to retrieve it, taking Warpath hostage in the process.{{issue|date=June 2016}} When he returns to Selene with the blade and the hostage, Selene kills him by stabbing him in the heart with the blade, reducing him to bones.<ref>''X-Force Vol. 3'' #24</ref>

'''Basil Elks''' is a petty thief who breaks into a museum to steal what he believes is an ordinary [[emerald]] - but is in fact an alien [[Kree]] artifact called the Alpha Stone. Elks, however, miscalculates the security guards rounds and is caught and fired upon when he reaches for a weapon. The guard's bullet accidentally hits and shatters the gem, causing an explosion that transforms Elks into a humanoid reptilian - his skin becomes green and scaly and his eyes are now large and red. Elks then flash-freezes the guard in place, and realizing that he now has superhuman abilities, decides to become a supervillain and calls himself the Basilisk. He faced off against [[Spider-Man]], [[Mister Fantastic]], [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]] and the [[Mole Man]] which ended with him being imprisoned in another Kree artifact called the Omega Stone that ended up in lava.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #16-17 (Dec. 1973-Jan. 1974).

He assists the [[Man-Bull]], the [[Griffin (Marvel Comics)|Griffin]], and another escaped inmate in a bank robbery. When [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] arrives, he recognizes that the fourth person with them is actually [[Hecate (Marvel Comics)|Hecate]].

'''Mike Columbus''' is a mutant and a student at the [[Xavier Institute for Higher Learning|Xavier Institute]].

Once the Basilisk's mutant power manifests, he suffers from brain seizures until given a device to help regulate the ability.

The Basilisk joins the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]]. They take over [[New York City]]. While watching human prisoners march by, he makes a joke about a perceived bad smell. The Brotherhood's leader [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] attempts to deliver a punishment, but kills the Basilisk instead.
{{-}}

===Powers and abilities===
Upon absorbing the Alpha Stone, Basil Elks possessed enhanced physical strength, reflexes, and stamina. The Basilisk's main offensive weapon were his eye beams, which could be concussive force (these could also be directed at the ground for limited flight) or energy that manipulated temperature (to [[boiling]] or [[freezing]] extremes) or molecules.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #16-17. Marvel Comics.</ref> Upon absorbing the Omega Stone, Basilisk's powers increased to their full extent, allowing him to generate volcanoes worldwide, including in the Savage Land and New York City.<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #16-17 and ''Marvel Team-Up'' #47. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Wayne Gifford was a normal human until becoming the Basilisk, a large humanoid reptile. The creature possesses superhuman strength and agility, and a paralyzing stare. The Basilisk's one weakness is its reflection, which serves as a reminder of its former state.

Mike Columbus possesses an overly-fleshy head devoid of all features except for sunken ears, a slit-like mouth, and a single centered eye socket. A camera-like device is located in this socket that allows the Basilisk to control his superhuman mutant ability to emit a pulse of high-frequency strobe light from his brain. The light paralyzes any sentient being that views it, while the length of the effect varies depending upon the willpower of the onlooker.

'''Dr. Donald''' "'''Don'''" '''Blake''' is the fictional doctor identity of [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. The character, created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], first appeared in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #83 (August 1962).

Donald Blake is a construct of [[Odin (comics)|Odin]], created for the purpose of giving a weak and powerless identity for Thor. After removing his memory, Thor started his life as the crippled Don who chose to be a doctor after sympathizing with the sick. Don finds the hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]] and transforms into the God of Thunder. Later, Don regains his memory as Thor and soon learns the whole truth from Odin.<ref>''Thor'' #159</ref> The Blake identity has been used here and there before Odin opted to erase him from existence. After Thor was killed by The Serpent, Donald Blake suddenly came into existence as a separate entity fully aware that his whole life had been a lie. Under the alias of the Dragon, Blake conducted a deadly campaign against Odin, the former All-Father of Asgard, and targeted all those blessed by Odin's magic. After an epic battle, Blake is defeated, but demands that Odin kill him, declaring that he'll never allow himself to be imprisoned again. While Odin is ready to carry out the deed, Loki and Thor work together to stop him, recognizing Blake as their brother and, like Loki, someone who has suffered from being brought into their dysfunctional family. Nevertheless, Blake caused a huge amount of suffering and remains dangerous, so Thor hands him over to Loki, who accepts the responsibility of dealing with the brother their father forgot. Blake is chained in a dungeon, with a venomous serpent forever hovering above him, dripping its poison into his eyes, the same punishment Loki has suffered in the past. Loki then officially renounce his title as the God of Lies, passing it to Blake.

===Alternate versions===
*In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] Universe, Donald Blake is the alternate identity of [[Balder (comics)|Balder]].
*A non-powered version of Blake appears as a resistance fighter in an alternate history line where [[Hypothetical Axis victory in World War II|the Nazis have won World War Two]].<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 4 #17-20 (November 2003-January 2004)</ref>

However, Barkley and the Wake Riders are released from police custody when their publicist Gabby Flenkman fabricates a cover story that [[J. Jonah Jameson]] supports.

==Blitzkrieg==
{{Comics character list header

'''Blitzkrieg''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]]. He was created by [[Mark Gruenwald]], [[Bill Mantlo]], [[Steven Grant]], and [[John Romita, Jr.]], and first appeared in ''Marvel Super-Heroes: Contest of Champions'' #1 (June 1982).

Franz Mittelstaedt was born in [[Backnang]], [[Germany]]. He was inspecting an electrical power plant when a stray bolt of lightning struck a faulty generator and bathed him in electricity. When he emerged from his coma weeks later, he found that he could summon lightning at will to wield as a weapon. He decided to use his powers in the name of democracy.

Later he was teleported away by the [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]], along with hundreds of other heroes of Earth, so that the Grandmaster and [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] could choose champions from among them. Blitzkrieg was chosen for the Grandmaster's team, fighting alongside fellow heroes [[Captain America]], the aboriginal [[Talisman (Marvel Comics)|Talisman]] III, [[Darkstar (Marvel Comics)|Darkstar]], [[Captain Britain]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Defensor (comics)|Defensor]], [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Peregrine (comics)|Peregrine]], [[She-Hulk]], and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]. When the Grandmaster's team won the contest, the heroes were returned to Earth.

Blitzkrieg later joined the German superhero team ''Schutz Heiliggruppe'', along with [[Hauptmann Deutschland]] and [[Everyman (Marvel Comics)|Zeitgeist]]. The team intended to arrest the [[Red Skull]] for his World War II war crimes, assaulting [[Arnim Zola]]'s castle and fighting and defeating the [[Skeleton Crew (comics)|Skeleton Crew]].

Blitzkrieg later traveled to Buenos Aires to investigate the deaths of a number of South American superheroes, including his former ally Defensor. Blitzkrieg was confronted by his teammate Zeitgeist, who turned out to be the serial killer Everyman. Everyman killed Blitzkrieg, adding him to his long list of murdered superheroes, but Blitzkrieg was later avenged by Hauptmann Deutschland, now known as Vormund, who killed Everyman.

Blitzkrieg possessed the ability to summon lightning mentally, at up to 15,000,000 volts. He can manipulate all forms of electrical energy, using them to allow him to fly, create electrical energy shields and cages, and electrical tornadoes. He is also immune to electricity, and can sense electrical transmissions and track them to their source.

The character subsequently appears as '''Blockbuster''' in ''Omega the Unknown'' #7 (March 1977), and #9 (July 1977), in which he is killed.

The man originally known as the Man-Brute was an ex-convict whose strength was boosted by a factor of twelve by Professor Silas X. Cragg. Cragg was an enemy of [[Captain America]] from the World War II era who had developed a variant of the Super Soldier Serum which he used to empower the Man-Brute. Cragg sent the Man-Brute to attack Captain America at a charity event, but when the Man-Brute ran into his own estranged son he became upset at what he had become. Man-Brute attacked Cragg, who backed into a high voltage machine and was electrocuted.<ref>''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]] #121'' (January 1970)</ref>

Renaming himself Blockbuster, he sought to acquire wealth for his son Robert, to give him a better life and keep him from becoming a criminal like himself. He robbed a bank, leading to conflict with the NYPD and then [[Omega the Unknown]]. Omega felt empathy for Blockbuster and his son, and let the man escape with the money. After Blockbuster robbed a diamond store, the owner offered a thousand dollar reward to which Omega responded. After struggling with Omega a few times, Blockbuster was incinerated by the second [[Foolkiller#Greg Salinger|Foolkiller]].<ref>''Omega the Unknown'' #9 (July 1977)</ref>

Blockbuster possessed superhuman strength, durability, endurance, etc. He was an experienced street fighter, although he did not demonstrate any advanced fighting skills.

The '''Blood Spider''' ('''Michael Bingham''') is a [[fictional]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #367 (October 1992), created by writer [[David Michelinie]] and artist [[Jerry Bingham]].

Blood Spider is a mercenary trained by [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] under contract by the [[Red Skull]] to create a team of mercenaries who would be capable of defeating [[Spider-Man]]. The trio were patterned after the superheroes [[Captain America]], [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] and Spider-Man, and the characters were called [[Death-Shield]], [[Jagged Bow]] and Blood Spider.{{issue|date=March 2016}}

[[Solo (Marvel Comics)|Solo]] joined the fray on the side of the wall-crawler and helps to defeat the three villains and thwart Red Skull's machinations who was using the mercenaries to guard private files sought by Spider-Man in reference to his parents.{{issue|date=March 2016}}

Years later, Blood Spider appears with Death-Shield and Jagged Bow among the criminals vying for the multi-million dollar bounty that was placed on [[Flash Thompson|Agent Venom]]'s head by Lord Ogre. The trio's attempt on Agent Venom's life is interrupted by competing mercenaries [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]] and Lord Deathstrike.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Cullen Bunn|penciller = Kim Jacinto|inker = Kim Jacinto|colorist = Lee Loughridge|letterer = Joe Caramagna|editor = Sana Amanat|title = Venom|volume = 2|issue = #37|date = 3 July 2013|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

[[Crime Master]], with the help of Blood Spider, Death-Shield and Jagged Bow, later tries to steal a damaged Rigellian Recorder from [[Deadpool]] and the Mercs for Money.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Cullen Bunn|penciller = Salva Espin|inker = Salva Espin|colorist = Guru-eFX|letterer = VC's Joe Sabino|editor = Jordan D. White|title = Deadpool & the Mercs for Money|volume = |issue = #2|date = 16 March 2016|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

Of the trio, Blood Spider was the only character who displayed any superhuman abilities. He was able to shatter a solid concrete wall with a very powerful move, indicating he possessed some degree of superhuman strength. He was not as powerful as Spider-Man, and not nearly as fast. He carried a back pack and wrist devices capable of shooting webbing similar to that of Spider-Man, but much weaker. An ordinary human in peak physical condition, such as Solo, was able to tear through it, which would not have been possible with Spider-Man's webbing. Blood Spider's costume has several design elements that Bagley would later incorporate into the redesign of [[Ben Reilly]]'s Spider-Man costume. The most prominent of the traits is the use of a larger, symmetrical spider emblem on the front and back, the legs of which meet on the shoulders.

==Bloodwraith==
'''Bloodwraith''' ('''Sean Dolan''') is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe. He was created by [[Mark Gruenwald]], [[Dann Thomas]], [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Tony DeZuniga]], and first appeared in ''[[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]]'' #2 (July 1990).

Bloodwraith is the murderous enemy of [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]] and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. While Sean Dolan was known as Bloodwraith, Bloodwraith is made up of the souls of those the [[Ebony Blade]] has slain. He is an expert swordsman compelled to take lives, especially innocent lives. The blade is indestructible and able to cut through almost any material. The blade was forged from a meteorite and [[Merlin (Marvel Comics)|Merlin]]'s magic. The blade can trap dead souls and absorb or deflect all kinds of energies and mystical power. Bloodwraith can sense the ebony blade and control it like a telekinetic. If separated, Bloodwraith can teleport to the Ebony Blade or teleport the blade to himself. Bloodwraith rides a [[Pegasus|winged horse]] named [[Valinor (comics)|Valinor]].

Sean Dolan was an amateur swordsman with no special abilities. When Sean drew the ebony blade, he found himself overwhelmed and controlled by all the souls of those the sword had slain, and became the Bloodwraith. The Bloodwraith was dark black in color and appeared in costume. The sword constantly craved new blood to add, and those it slew found their souls locked in an eternal battle of good vs. evil in a dimension inside the sword. Bloodwraith rides his winged horse, Valinor, and is an expert swordsman. He can control the ebony blade rather like a telekinetic. When separated from the blade, he can sense its presence and instantaneously teleport to its location. The ebony blade could slice through anything and, previously, would curse its wielder with petrification if its wielder used the blade to draw blood. When he wielded Proctor's sword, the Bloodwraith and Valinor appeared much more skeletal and could channel powerful blasts through the sword. When powered by the Slorenian souls, Bloodwraith became composed of an energy unknown to man, and both he and the sword grew to gigantic size.

==Bullet==
'''Bullet''' ('''Buck Cashman''') is a minor character in [[Marvel Comics]]. He first appeared in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #250 (January 1988) and was created by [[Ann Nocenti]] and [[John Romita Jr.]]

Bullet is an agent to the United States government who performs covert activities of an unrevealed nature and who has the highest level security clearance such an agent can hold. He is in charge of his young son Lance who was obsessed with an imminent World War III - however, Bullet was rarely at home, leaving his son alone; indeed, Bullet's permanent address is different to Lance's, although Lance frequently lies to alibi his father. Lance's mother Gloria rarely accepts responsibilities to stay with Lance, much to Bullet's chagrin.

Bullet was assigned by a United States Army general on behalf of Wilson Fisk aka the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin of Crime]] to participate in a scheme against the environmental protection organization "Save the Planet". Bullet was to allow another man to bomb the organization's headquarter in terrorist fashion, and then to arrest the supposed terrorist himself. The saboteur would then be released through legal maneuvering. However, Matthew Murdock captured the saboteur personally. Murdock then encountered Bullet who said he would see to it that the saboteur went to jail. Murdock's superhuman senses realized that Bullet was lying, and Murdock and Bullet fought each other, but Murdock finally lets Bullet take the saboteur into custody. Soon after Bullet killed a man in toxic waste, framing the environmentalists for the murder. [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] accused Bullet of committing the murder, and the two fought. Bullet realized that Daredevil was the man who fought him previously but does not know the costumed crimefighter's true identity. When the police arrived at the scene, Bullet confessed to the murder and was taken into custody but after Bullet made a single phone call, all charges against him were dropped and he was released.

Since then, Bullet joined criminals recruited by [[Typhoid Mary (character)|Typhoid Mary]] in an attack on Daredevil that nearly killed the crimefighter.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #60</ref>

Daredevil decided to get revenge on Bullet; to do so, he tracked Bullet's son and helped him against some bullies, earning Lance's trust. Lance then invited Daredevil to his home and convinced him to not fight Bullet. Bullet entered unannounced and, misunderstanding the scene to believe that Daredevil was threatening Lance, attacked Daredevil. Lance stopped their fight to explain it all. Bullet admitted that he liked Daredevil, having attacked him only because he had been hired to do so. Daredevil decided that tracking Bullet had been useless and left.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #67</ref>

Recently, he acted as an unwilling host of the '''[[Phage (comics)|Phage]]''' symbiote.<ref>''Extreme Carnage: Phage'' #1</ref><ref>''Extreme Carnage: Lasher'' #1</ref>

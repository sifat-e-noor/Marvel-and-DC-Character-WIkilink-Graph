Theresa Maeve Rourke Cassidy is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly in association with the X-Men. Debuting under the codename Siryn, she later retired the name and went by Banshee, in honor of her late father, Sean Cassidy, who first used the alias.
Like her father, the X-Men's Banshee, Theresa is an Irish mutant who possesses a "sonic scream" that can incapacitate and injure an opponent's hearing, or send powerful vibrations through the air, the latter of which she can use to fly. Her name refers to the Sirens of Greek mythology.
Theresa was raised by Banshee's cousin and nemesis Black Tom Cassidy without Banshee's knowledge. By her early teens, she left Black Tom and eventually joined the X-Men offshoots X-Force and later X-Factor.


Publication history
Siryn was created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Steve Leialoha, and first appeared in Spider-Woman #37 (April 1981) as a villain. Along with many young mutants at the time such as Sunspot and Multiple Man, she featured in the limited series Fallen Angels (1987). She was one of the first members of X-Force (vol. 1) (1991), beginning in issue #3, and remained a regular in that book until issue #100 (2000). As a love interest of Deadpool, she concurrently appeared in one of his earliest solo titlesâ€”Deadpool: Sins of the Past (1994), and sporadically appeared in Deadpool (vol. 1) (1997) and Cable and Deadpool (vol. 1) (2005). In 2006, she rejoined forces with Multiple Man as a member of X-Factor (vol. 3) up until issue #244 (2012), in which she becomes The Morrigan and leaves the team and general publication.


Fictional character biography


Early life
While Sean Cassidy was working on a deep undercover mission for Interpol, his wife Maeve gave birth to their daughter, Theresa, at Cassidy Keep, County Mayo, Ireland. Maeve later dies in an IRA bombing, and with no means to contact Sean, his cousin Tom takes care of Theresa. When Sean returns and learns of his wife's death, he is devastated. Before Tom can tell him about Theresa, Sean lashes out at Tom with his sonic scream for not having taken better care of Maeve. As Sean flies away in anger, Tom falls into a chasm and breaks his leg, leaving him with a limp. Tom swears to make Sean pay and vows to never tell him about his daughter, and raises her himself.Tom (now known as Black Tom) trains Theresa as his apprentice in his criminal activities. As a young teen, she accompanies him and his then-partner, the Juggernaut, to San Francisco. She takes the name Siryn, aids them in a vibranium theft, and battles the original Spider-Woman. Due to her inexperience, she performs poorly in battle and is defeated by Spider-Woman again during Black Tom's temporary capture. Initially believing her to be seriously hurt, Black Tom resolves to break all association with her so that she will not be exposed to further danger. While in custody, he absolves Theresa of all responsibility for her crimes, and writes a letter to Sean explaining who she is. The X-Men bring Theresa back to their headquarters, where she is joyfully reunited with her father.


Muir Island

Theresa moves to Muir Island, home of the research laboratories of Dr. Moira MacTaggert, a longtime ally of Professor Xavier. During an overnight visit to Xavier Institute, Siryn, Kitty Pryde, Illyana Rasputin, and a young Muir Island resident named Amp battle robotic duplicates of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants after accidentally releasing them from the Danger Room. Later in the evening, Siryn gets into a fist fight with Kitty after Amp convinces her that Kitty was trying to sabotage her chances with a young man named Dimitri. After the fight is broken up by Wolverine, the girls reconcile and leave on friendly terms. She also accompanies Wolverine and Kitty when they are asked by Professor Xavier to act as bodyguards for the mutant pop-star Dazzler. Dazzler is impressed with Theresa's rendition of "Amazing Grace", that she asks the young mutant to act as a backing vocalist for her concert.On the island, Siryn starts a romantic relationship with Jamie Madrox. This version of Multiple Man is revealed to be one of his many duplicates and not the original Multiple Man, leading to the end of the relationship. During this time Siryn and Multiple Man travel to New York City. She and Madrox search for two members of the New Mutants: Sunspot and Warlock, who had run away from the school. Siryn and Multiple Man find Sunspot and meet the association of street-level mutants known as the Fallen Angels, and they are all transported to Devil Dinosaur's planet. They travel to the Coconut Grove, the home planet of the alien Ariel. While there, her superhuman powers are neutralized and she is made a captive by Unipar. She regains her superhuman powers and returns to Earth. She chooses to remain in the Fallen Angels for some time to help reform their criminal members.Back on Muir Island, she briefly falls under the mental control of the Shadow King.

Although Banshee warns Siryn that Deadpool is a madman and a murderer, she finds Deadpool attractive, and the feelings are reciprocated. Over time, Siryn becomes the voice of reason and sanity in Deadpool's ear. She assists him in some of his missions, such as when Deadpool felt he needed some blood from the Hulk in order to cure problems with his own healing powers. In the end Siryn becomes overwhelmed with balancing her duties with X-Force and the demands of Deadpool's mental health. She promises him that she would consider progressing their relationship if he continues on the path of good, and once she has her X-Force responsibilities secured. Warpath continues to seek Siryn's affections, and makes his dislike for Deadpool clear during a visit to the baseball diamond used in the movie Field of Dreams.Siryn confronts various adversaries during her time in X-Force: she puts down a coup in Asgard, and confronts the forces of Onslaught, the interdimensional media mogul known as Mojo, and S.H.I.E.L.D. on more than one occasion.

After spending a night drinking, Madrox awakens to learn that he and one of his duplicates slept with Theresa and Monet.

Upon questioning the family of the murder victims, Theresa notices two photos featuring the family's grandmother and granddaughter, both wearing triquetras. Although she first believes the little girl to be a mutant, Theresa realizes the girl is not when she summons a Celtic goddess, the Morrigan. The girl attempts to send the Morrigan back but she ignores the girl and takes Theresa, furious that she has been using the name Banshee, one of the many names associated with the Morrigan. The Morrigan takes Theresa to a lighthouse and offers her a choice: apologize and worship her, or die. Theresa rejects the Morrigan's offer and is thrown to her death as her vocal cords had been weakened by the ordeal. Havok arrives to see Theresa falling to her doom when she is rescued by a demon named Jezabel. Havok destroys the lighthouse, leaving the Morrigan trapped under rubble. Jezebel advises them the apocalypse is coming and Theresa will have to make a tough choice sometime within the near future: to become part of a race of new gods or perish with the rest of humanity.Over the next few days, Theresa considers drinking alcohol to help deal with what is going on when she is stopped by her father. Unsure if he is real, she attempts to seek help from the other members of X-Factor only to find Polaris has lost her mind. Theresa goes back to her room, where she continues to converse with Sean about the Morrigan and if he is real or some kind of hallucination when Layla enters, who reveals she knows what is going on. Theresa and Layla attempt to summon the Morrigan but Theresa is teleported to Ireland instead. During the confrontation, Theresa asks if the Morrigan can heal Lorna but the Morrigan advises her she cannot, as Lorna does not believe in her. The Morrigan reveals she is tired of being a goddess and misses her own father; if Theresa wants to help Lorna, she must become the Morrigan. Theresa agrees and hurls a sonic lance through the Morrigan, killing her. In that moment, Lorna is completely healed of her insanity. Theresa teleports back to headquarters, appearing before Jamie as the Morrigan and telling him goodbye. Theresa lets him know she never stopped loving him and if he needs her, all he has to do is pray before departing.After Jamie is transformed into a demon, he takes her up on this offer so she rescues  and transforms him back into human form. She then asks the now-married Madrox and Layla if they want to reform the team but, they decline saying that they have a farm to start up and a baby on the way.


House of X
Theresa, back in her mortal form, is seen on Krakoa reunited with her father. During the celebration after the Quiet Council's first meeting, she uses her sonic powers in conjunction with Dazzler's light abilities to put on a light show for the people.


Powers and abilities
Siryn is a mutant who possesses sonic powers similar to those of her father, Banshee, although she is able to use her powers in ways that Banshee could not. Like her father, she has the ability to emit high-decibel "sonic screams" to create various sonic effects with her vocal cords. She can vary the pitch to deflect projectiles. She possesses an enhanced sense of hearing and can use her voice to detect objects via echolocation. While screaming, Siryn is able to fly at the speed of sound. She has potent sonic attacks that can shatter objects; project concussive blasts of sonic force (a "sonic lance"); and cause immediate pain, nausea/vomiting, and unconsciousness. She has shown a degree of resistance to sounds and vibrations that would be harmful or painful to normal humans and mutants without sonic-based powers. She possesses psionic powers to create a force field that protects her against her own sonic vibrations, assists her ability to fly, and directs her sonic powers.
She is vulnerable to losing her power by overstraining and overusing her sonic screams or injury to her throat and vocal cords. She lacks fine control of her abilities when in extreme distress: for example, when she screamed in pain during her pregnancy, she unwillingly shattered every window in the complex and caused the medical staff to writhe in agony.Unlike her father, Siryn is able to influence and control other human beings with her sonics, and cause them to enter a hypnotic state. Siryn can cause the intended person to fall in love with her without regard to gender or sexual orientation and carry out her wishes and commands, like mythical Sirens. Siryn once used this ability on Spider-Man, forcing him to divulge the truth about the Decimation of the mutants.In addition, she can prevent others from hearing external sounds by a certain vocal pitch so that she can secretly deliver messages to them.When Theresa becomes the Morrigan, she gains numerous undefined mystical abilities. Her known powers include the ability to teleport by her own free will or to people who summon her using the correct ritual, heal her followers and people with a personal bond to her, and some form of immortality or longevity. She is able to revert Jamie to his human form and absorb laser blasts from a gun that can destroy Layla Miller's force field.

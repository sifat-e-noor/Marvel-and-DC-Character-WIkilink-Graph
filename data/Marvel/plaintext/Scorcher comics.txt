Fictional character biography
Steven Hudak was a research chemist who was wrongfully accused of embezzlement by his employer. Swearing revenge, he created an armored suit containing flame-throwing equipment and taking the name "The Scorcher" he attacked his former place of employment. He ran afoul of Spider-Man on one of his first outings, and being defeated by the hero, he was sent to prison. Later, it was revealed that The Scorcher was not working alone but was an agent of Norman Osborn (who would later become the Green Goblin). Hudak eventually escaped prison to pursue an arson career but was defeated by Spider-Man a second time.He once attacked Christmas shoppers, only to be stopped by Ben Reilly who was acting as Spider-Man at the time (Ben noting that encountering the Scorcher after so long left him feeling particularly old). Later, the second Crimson Cowl recruited Scorcher to join her incarnation of the Masters of Evil.When Matt Murdock's identity as Daredevil was revealed, he and Diamondback II moved to confront Murdock, but were driven off by Daredevil and Spider-Man. The Scorcher encountered Daredevil again in the Secret War series when he was forced by Lucia von Bardas to band together with other supervillains and attack S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters which was defended by a dozen of New York's superheroes including Daredevil. Daredevil was instrumental in the criminal's personal defeat. Soon afterwards, Hudak promised his ex-wife he would give up his criminal life soon.
The Savage Land Mutates tried hiring the Scorcher to break Sauron out of jail, but he refused.

Powers and abilities
The Scorcher's powers derive from his flame-throwing equipment, which provides him the ability to produce large quantities of fire under his control. His costume provides him with protection against heat and flame as well as conventional forms of injury. Later, he added a jet pack to his armor, giving him the ability to fly and to hover in place.

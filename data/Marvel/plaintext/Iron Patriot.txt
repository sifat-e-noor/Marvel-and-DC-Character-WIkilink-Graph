Fictional history


Norman Osborn

Norman Osborn donned the original Iron Patriot armor during the Dark Reign storyline to exert his authority as "commander" of H.A.M.M.E.R. and the Dark Avengers while using Oscorp's resources. However, the Iron Patriot's star-shaped Uni Beam projector had a less powerful output. Unsurprisingly, Osborn's activities as the Iron Patriot have been jeopardized by the original Avengers: Osborn gets tricked into attacking Tony Stark, and when the New Avengers led by Captain America used the Iron Patriot's tracking device on Luke Cage as a trick to destroy his own house. During Osborn's invasion of Asgard on the grounds of a national security threat, the Iron Patriot is disabled during Osborn's fight with Steve Rogers, revealing Osborn's Green Goblin-like face paint. When Rogers, Stark and Thor transfer him to the Raft penitentiary, Osborn blames his Goblin alter-ego for ruining his chance to protect America as the Iron Patriot.

The Iron Patriot Drones are sent to attack Iran to which S.H.I.E.L.D. sent the Hulk in response.

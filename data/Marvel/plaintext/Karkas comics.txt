Fictional character biography
Karkas was born in Deviant Lemuria, too monstrous in appearance even by Deviant standards. He was made a slave, pitted in gladiatorial contests against others considered grotesque. Another gladiator was Ransak the Reject, who was considered hideous by the Deviants due to his normal human appearance (also interpretable as because he looked too much like an Eternal). Karkas and the Reject were pitted against each other, in a bout viewed by the Eternal Thena, in which Ransak bested Karkas. When Eson the Celestial attacked, Karkas begged Thena for sanctuary with the Deviants' enemies, the Eternals. Thena teleported both Karkas and Ransak away to Olympia. With Thena and Ransak, Karkas battled Zakka and Tutinax. Since then the two have become friends and reside primarily with the Eternals. Karkas became a scholar.
Later, Karkas fought Thor, and then became his ally. He participated in a battle between the Olympian gods and Eternals.Later, Karkas captured Warlord Kro. Karkas attempted to save Margo Damian's life by tricking Ghaur. Karkas helped fight Ghaur's army, and was present at Margo's burial.

Karkas was part of the Delta Network led by Kro, assembled to challenge Ghaur's grip on the Deviants. He continued to support Kro's faction in his dispute with Ghaur for the deviant's leadership.

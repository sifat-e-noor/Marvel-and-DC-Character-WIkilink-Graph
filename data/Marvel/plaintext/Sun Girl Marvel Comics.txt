Fictional character biography


Mary Mitchell
A personal secretary for Jim Hammond, the original Human Torch, during the post-war 1940s, Mary Mitchell falls in love with him and becomes his partner as well as his sidekick after Toro leaves to tend to his ailing foster mother. In The Human Torch #32 (Sept. 1948), Sun Girl helps the Torch clear the name of an innocent man accused of murder charges, by exposing the real culprit. Later, they convince a retired doctor to perform surgery on a little girl who accidentally swallowed a diamond hidden in a lollypop. Mary leaves to go on her own adventures after that. She carries a solar ray gun. She occasionally teams up with heroes besides the Torch, such as Captain America. After Toro returns she resumes her position as secretary and researcher.
During the "Last Days" part of the Secret Wars storyline, Sun Girl was seen living at Valhalla Villas (a retirement home for ex-heroes and ex-villains that is located in Miami). She is among the residents that were temporarily de-aged during the final incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610.


Selah Burke

A new Sun Girl later appears as one of the heroes temporarily possessed by the Carrion virus after she came in contact with William Allen. Sun Girl is attacked by The Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus' mind in Peter Parker's body). The Superior Spider-Man cures Sun Girl of the Carrion virus. Her identity is later revealed to be Selah Burke, the daughter of Lightmaster at the time when the Superior Spider-Man made use of his Superior Six (consisting of a brainwashed Chameleon, Electro, Mysterion, Sandman, and Vulture) to combat the Wrecking Crew. After the Superior Spider-Man fails and the now free Superior Six have captured him and taken hold of a machine that could destroy New York City, Selah manages to save Superior Spider-Man and destroy the machine. They part in bad terms, with Sun Girl thinking that Superior Spider-Man is a "jerk" due to his condescending attitude and insane brainwashing scheme.Selah next appeared in issue #1 of the 2014 New Warriors relaunch, helping to save the Morlocks from an attack by the mysterious Evolutionaries. When offered the opportunity to walk away by these attackers (as they have no intention of going after normal humans), she opts to sacrifice so the mutants can run away. Haechi steps in and uses his energy absorbing powers to shield her. Speedball and Justice enter the scene which makes the three attackers reevaluate their tactical position and later flee as they were now outnumbered.


Powers and abilities
Mary Mitchell is a good acrobat and is an expert in both Judo and Jiu Jutsu. She also wields a Sunbeam Ray Gun which produces a bright blast of light as well as a lariat which she keeps in her emergency pouch.

She also wields pistols capable of firing concussive blasts. She developed and constructed her gear and weapons based on her father's light manipulation technology.

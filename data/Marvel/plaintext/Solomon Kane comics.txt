Solomon Kane is a fictional character featured in several comics published by Marvel Comics in the 1970s and 1980s. He was originally created by the pulp-era writer Robert E. Howard. Dark Horse Comics began publishing a new series of Kane stories in 2008, and also published collections of the 1970s Marvel stories in 2009.


Marvel Comics
Marvel Comics published several comic books featuring Solomon Kane. He was the lead character in the six-issue limited series Sword of Solomon Kane, published 1985-6. He also appeared numerous times in the company's black and white, non-Code approved magazine format comics, most frequently in Savage Sword of Conan, starring Howard's most popular pulp character. The complete list of Marvel's Solomon Kane story appearances are:

Monsters Unleashed #1 (August 1973), an adaptation of Howard's Skulls in the Stars by Roy Thomas, art by Ralph Reese.
Dracula Lives #3 (October 1973), Kane meets Dracula by Thomas, art by Alan Weiss.
The Conan Saga #50 (May 1991) by Alan Rowlands, art by Steve Carr and Al Williamson (although this magazine was a reprint title, the Kane story in this issue had not been previously published).
Kull and the Barbarians #2–3 (July and September 1975), an adaptation of The Hills of the Dead by Thomas, art by Weiss, Neal Adams and Pablo Marcos.
Marvel Premiere #33–34 (December 1976 and February 1977). Like the Kane mini-series, this was a Code-approved four-color comic, an adaptation of Red Shadows by Thomas, art by Howard Chaykin.
Marvel Preview #19 (Summer 1979), an adaptation of "The Footfalls Within" by Don Glut, art by Will Meugniot and Steve Gan.

The Sword of Solomon Kane #1–6 (September 1985–July 1986). Of the six issues, four adapted Howard stories (all previously adapted by Marvel), and two (#2 and #4) contained original stories by Ralph Macchio, with the art credits varying. The finale also contained yet another rendering of the poem "Solomon Kane's Homecoming," illustrated by Sandy Plunkett and Williamson.

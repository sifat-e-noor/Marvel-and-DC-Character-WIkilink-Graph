Tamara Rahn is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. She is an alien of the water-breathing extraterrestrial Banari race from the planet Laab and a red-skinned humanoid with blonde hair.


Publication history
Tamara Rahn first appeared in Sub-Mariner #58 (Feb 1973), and was created by Bill Everett (writer), Steve Gerber (writer), and Sam Kweskin (artist).
Namor, the Sub-Mariner writer Glenn Herdling recounted that his predecessor on the series, Bob Harras, "had brought back Tamara Rahn and had introduced a love affair between her and Tiger Shark, which I went with. Bob had given me only one dictate: Don't kill Tamara! It was actually a blessing, because in the 'Starblast' crossover I was able to provide closure to the story that had introduced her 20 years earlier."

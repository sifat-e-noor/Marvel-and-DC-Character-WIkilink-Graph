Fictional character biography
T'Chaka II is the son of Black Panther and is named after his grandfather T'Chaka. When a racist team of villains called Soldiers of the Serpent attacked T'Challa's friend N'Kano (who was on a diplomatic mission for Wakanda in New York), A-Next tried to save him. As the Serpents battled with the heroes of A-Next, T'Challa's son T'Chaka II charged into battle. While Mainframe tried to convince the youth to leave the battle, T'Chaka II shapeshifted into a feral black werecat called the "Coal Tiger". Coal Tiger's bestial abilities were able to turn the tide in A-Next's favor. He was offered membership with the team after the battle was won, but he declined stating that he would be available to help if they needed him.When all of the members of A-Next were captured by an evil version of A-Next called the Revengers, Coal Tiger was one of the many heroes who came to free the captured superheroes. When A-Next was freed and the Revengers were defeated, Coal Tiger finally agreed to join the team.When Magneto apparently resurfaced, Coal Tiger joined the reserve members in fighting him where it was discovered that this Magneto is Charlie Philips using a magnetic harness.

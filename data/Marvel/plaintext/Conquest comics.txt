Plot synopsis
Mark Grayson was a normal high school senior with a normal part-time job whose father Nolan is the alien (but human-appearing) Omni-Man, the most powerful superhero on the planet. At age 17, Mark begins to display superpowers, which come from his father being a member of the Viltrumite race, who, according to Nolan, pioneer the galaxy on a mission of benevolence and enlightenment.
As Invincible, Mark begins working as a superhero with his father acting as his mentor, and meeting other heroes (including Robot, Rex Splode, Dupli-Kate and Atom Eve).  His exploits range from discovering that his physics teacher has been turning his students into human bombs, to foiling a plan by the Mauler Twins to make an army of robots. Meanwhile, Omni-Man is kidnapped by aliens, taken to another dimension. He returns after what seems to be only a few days but was actually eight months to him.

Characters


Grayson family
Mark Grayson: A 17-year-old high school student and a Viltrumite/human hybrid who becomes the superhero Invincible.
Omni-Man: Mark's father Nolan, Debbie's husband and formerly the greatest superhero of Earth.
Debbie Grayson: Mark's mother, Nolan's wife, adoptive mother of Oliver Grayson.
Lord Argall: The former king of the Viltrumites prior to his death and the father of Omni-Man and grandfather of Invincible and Oliver Grayson.
Oliver Grayson: Mark's alien half-brother. The result of a relationship between Nolan and a member of an alien race who have short life spans, growing at a rapidly increased rate compared to humans, though his father's DNA is slowing his aging over time. Although his mother is an insect-like humanoid, he resembles a Viltrumite/human with purple skin (later fades to pink). His mother tells his brother to take him to Earth, so that he can have a life with the people there, because their lifespan is longer than her people's, and he gets adopted by Debbie. He first takes the sobriquet of Kid Omni-Man and then Young Omni-Man as he attempts to rehabilitate the memory of Omni-Man in the general public.
Terra Grayson: The daughter of Atom Eve and Mark Grayson who would go on to become the third Invincible.
Markus Murphy: Also known as Marky, he is the son of Mark and Anissa after the latter raped the former. He would go to become Kid Invincible.


Superheroes
Atom Eve: Samantha Eve Wilkins is a former classmate of Mark's and member of the Teen Team. Eve was created as a result of a government experiment to create super-beings. She can manipulate all matter, although a mental block has previously stopped her from creating and manipulating living things. Eventually she and Mark realize their true feelings for each other and the pair start dating, fall in love, and get married after Eve gives birth to their daughter Terra.
Allen the Alien: Previously a Champion Evaluation Officer who worked for the Coalition of Planets, he traveled on a tight schedule and tested the skills of various powered heroes on each planet in order to determine if there is a suitable "champion" to defend that planet. He was later promoted to leader of the Coalition of Planets.
The Guardians of the Globe:
The Immortal: Apparently unkillable leader of the Guardians of the Globe and currently married to Dupli-Kate. It is suggested in flashbacks that one of his past identities was in fact Abraham Lincoln. In the present storyline, he is alive. Revealed to rule the world as a tyrant in the far alternate future, where he is finally killed by Invincible at his own behest. Invincible prevents this in his own timeline by giving The Immortal the assistance of Robot's brain to rule with suggestive guidance.
Black Samson: Lost his powers (and with them, his Guardian status) for a while before recovering them very abruptly.

Shrinking Ray: Former member of the Guardians of the Globe, now dead.
Monster Girl: A girl who was cursed by a gypsy, now able to shapeshift into a large ogre-like creature with superhuman strength.

The Shapesmith: A Martian, disguised as human astronaut Rus Livingston, who uses his metamorphic powers to change his shape.
Darkwing: Formerly Night Boy, the original Darkwing's sidekick, he continued Darkwing's legacy but snapped and started killing criminals until Invincible apprehended him. A reformed Darkwing joined the Guardians of the Globe. He can teleport himself and others via the Shadow-verse using any shadow large enough to envelop him. Dragged by one of the extra-dimensional Invincibles into the Shadow-verse, this new Darkwing is later revealed to be alive and aged from the experience.

In 2003 and 2004, Image and Robert Kirkman published several other superhero series: Tech Jacket pencilled in a manga style by E. J. Su (cancelled at #6), the 3-issue Capes Inc. series drawn by Mark Englert and three oneshots starring Brit, the first two with artwork from Tony Moore and the third with artwork by Cliff Rathburn.
In 2007, Brit was launched as an ongoing full-color series written by Bruce Brown, with artwork by Cliff Rathburn. The series was overseen and edited by Robert Kirkman. In late 2007, a two issue mini-series starring Atom Eve was released.
Tech Jacket was first collected as a digest-sized, black and white graphic novel and later reissued in regular sized, full color and a cover scheme similar to Kirkman's other trade paper backs. Capes was collected as a trade paperback in summer 2007, and the three Brit one-shots were colored by Val Staples and published as a collection in 2007, as well.
At first shown to barely coexist in the same universe, the characters have since been integrated into Invincible's book. Tech Jacket was an ongoing series that tied into Invincible #27, and the character has been seen in the background of various battles during the series. The characters from Capes have also been supporting characters seen mainly in large superhero battles Invincible participates in, and the series ran as a back-up in the Invincible book starting with #27. Brit has had an even less substantial role, appearing a couple of times in the aforementioned brawls (understandable considering that after the last book Brit was somewhat-retired). Brit later went on to become the leader of the Guardians of the Globe and was featured heavily in comic spin-offs Guarding the Globe and Invincible Universe. In The Astounding Wolf-Man, Art, Invincible's tailor, appeared, designing the title character's costume. Wolf-man has also appeared in Invincible #48 & 49.

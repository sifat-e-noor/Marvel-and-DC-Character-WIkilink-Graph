Fictional character biography
In the early days of the universe, Laufey ruled Jotunheim, realm of the Frost Giants. When his son Loki was born a runt, an ashamed Laufey ordered the baby hidden.Odin, the King of Asgard, marched his forces into Jotunheim. Welding the mystical hammer Mjolnir, Odin faced down Laufey and destroyed his war club, prompting the Frost Giant to brandish a sword. Laufey tried to use his knowledge of land, such as trying to stop Odin with a concealed fire pit. A sprawling battle between the two forces ensued. The battle ended when Odin used Mjolnir to crush Laufey's skull. Odin discovered Loki in the wreckage of the castle and decided to raise him as his own. 
It was later retconned that Loki had been a child, rather than a baby, when Laufey was killed. The day before the battle, Loki had attempted to inform his father of an opportunity to stealthily kill Odin. Laufey struck Loki for calling him a coward. The next day, after the fateful battle and Odin's claiming of Loki as a son, Laufey was left wounded, but alive. A version of Loki from the future, who had traveled back in time to alter events, proceeded to decapitate him, stating that Laufey would never strike him again. He also made Odin adopt him.Laufey's skull plays an important role in the first three issues of the renewed Thor series. Laufey's revitalized men attempt to reclaim his remains from a Roxxon facility owned by Minotaur. Upon traveling to Jotunheim with Malekith the Accursed, Minotaur used the blood of the Light Elves that were killed as part of a spell to resurrect Laufey.As part of the "All-New, All-Different Marvel" event, Laufey appears as a member of the Dark Council alongside Malekith the Accursed, Minotaur, Ulik, and some unnamed Fire Demons.During the "War of the Realms" storyline, Laufey appears and is about to eat Frigga when Loki arrives and saves his adopted mother. Laufey berates Loki on his recent treachery in the past. He then picks him up and seemingly eats him. Odin later gets enraged when he finds out that Laufey ate Loki. Laufey is later seen at the ruins of the Statue of Liberty swatting fighter jets. Laufey is later attacked by the Fantastic Four and an army of Dwarves that are wearing copies of the War Machine armor. Iron Man, Punisher, She-Hulk, Spider-Man, and Wolverine are fighting Laufey's Frost Giants. As Captain Marvel, Black Panther, Sif, and Thing confront Laufey, he pulls out the Casket of Ancient Winters which he eats as it augments his powers. While protected by Hofund's magic, Daredevil fights with Laufey until Laufey eats Hofund when it is thrown at him. Noticing that the Earth-1610 Mjolnir is going to self-destruct, Jane Foster throws it into Laufey as a half-digested Loki cuts himself and the Casket of Ancient Winters using Hofund where his magic is holding his body together.

They destroy an energy plant as proof of their convictions. The group tries to free them by force, but this only ends in confusion. During the break-in, Cable tries to intervene and a prison guard accidentally shoots Rusty. Skids believes that it was Cable who shot her friend, so she decides to side with the MLF.The New Mutants track the team down to Madripoor and get in a few conflicts with them. Even with the help of Sunfire, the MLF manages to capture several of the New Mutants. However, their victory is short-lived with the arrival of Wolverine who helps the teens liberate their kidnapped friends. But before the MLF can be caught, they teleport to safety.Strobe next appears with an MLF strike force who attempt to break Nasty Boys members Slab and Hairbag out of prison.

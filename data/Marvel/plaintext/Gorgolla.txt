Strange and his ally Namor the Sub-Mariner were defeated by the alien, but Xemnu was in turn beaten by the Hulk. Xemnu then took possession of Amos Moses, mayor of small-town Plucketville, in an attempt to kidnap the townspeople of Plucketville to repopulate his home planet. The newly formed Defenders (Doctor Strange, the Hulk, the Sub-Mariner and the Valkyrie) fought him, thus preventing him from using the townspeople to construct another starship. Xemnu continued his vendetta against the Hulk via a series of clones created from samples of other "classic Marvel" alien monsters, sent to attack the Hulk, and battled the Hulk himself; however, he was defeated when the dam containing his hideout burst. Xemnu later used Amos Moses' body in an attempt to once again take control of the Earth via television-transmitted hypnosis. Xemnu took mental control of the Los Angeles-based hero Wonder Man using him to attack his ally, the Thing. The heroes eventually defeated Xemnu, and he fled in a starship.Later, deep in space, Xemnu infiltrates the spacecraft-haulage craft owned by Ulysses Solomon Archer. He takes over the enclosed area of the Star Stop Diner and confronts a pregnant woman known as Mary McGrill. He plans to genetically alter her child to make it one of his own race. He is opposed by Razorback, Archer, the She-Hulk and everyone else at the diner, but they are easily knocked out by his psychic powers. The She-Hulk awakens ahead of the others and finds that Xemnu is attempting to turn her into a "She-Xemnu." Ultimately, Xemnu is defeated and given over to a powerful humanoid alien named Big Enilwen. This childlike being believes that Xemnu is simply a teddy bear to play with.Xemnu convinces Enilwen to free his teddy bear population to 'the wild'. He returns to confront the She-Hulk again, this time to sell her into slavery. This time he is defeated by a large monkey wrench to the head, wielded by the She-Hulk's friend Louise Mason.Xemnu reappeared as one of the Space Phantom's kidnapped bodies in Beyond!. He appeared in Annihilation: Conquest as one of the Phalanx select.Xemnu later returned to Earth and fought the Red Hulk after Woodgod's defeat. During that time, the Impossible Man uses his magic to combine the Hulk and the Red Hulk into the Compound Hulk, which fights Xemnu's minion Kluh (a smart version of the Gray Hulk) and overpowers it.Xemnu later appeared on Monster Isle when Shadowcat and Magik appeared to look for a mutant girl named Bo. Xemnu was among the monsters that attacked the three until Magik teleported herself, Shadowcat, and Bo to the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning.Xemnu later appears alongside Rocket Raccoon.During the "Monsters Unleashed" storyline, Xemnu is among the monsters seen falling from the sky near San Diego.Xenmu appears again, currently living on Monster Isle. He is approached by Roxxon CEO Dario Agger as part of his plan to ruin the Hulk's public image and replace him with his own Hulk. Augmented with cybernetics, Xenmu appears to save citizens from several giant internal parasites that the Hulk accidentally unleashed which led to his Devil Hulk persona changing to the Savage Hulk persona. Knowing that the media is watching, Xenmu uses his powers to subtly take control of the viewers by asking if they remember him. While this is going on, he allows the Hulk to fight him so that he can purposely lose control of the parasites to worsen the Hulk's public image. After being saved by the Absorbing Man, the Hulk leaves as Xenmu's powers have begun to influence those who witnessed the event on screen, as shown with one of the Hulk's current allies, Dr. Charlene McGowan, whose recount of meeting Daredevil for the first time was now changed to meeting Xenmu. In Bruce Banner's mind, the Savage Hulk persona comments that he cannot fight Xemnu's hypnosis. The Green Scar persona reappears and states that he can. Minotaur discovered Xemnu had transformed the people he fed on into Xemnu/human hybrid minions. Upon objecting to this, Xemnu consumed Minotaur and transformed him into a deformed Xemnu/Minotaur hybrid creature unable to speak. The Hulk in his Green Scar persona managed to slay Xemnu enough to break the mind control.


Xemnu in other media
Xemnu appears in the Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. episode, "The Strongest One There Is", voiced by Fred Tatasciore. This version is much taller and stronger than the Hulk. He is interested in challenging local fighters and delivers a challenge, via hologram, to fight the Hulks - all except Rick. Seeing it as pointless, the Hulk moves to reject but Rick accepts on behalf of the entire team. His colleagues lose. Feeling guilty, Rick tries one more time and manages to defeat Xemnu. Xemnu declares his journey for a skilled fight over and bonds with Rick over video games and doughnuts.
Six years after the release of the original comic, the fictitious alien Xemnu (under the barely altered name Xenu or Xemu) would become a central part of the secret teachings of the new religion of Scientology. Due to L. Ron Hubbard's heavy drinking and drug use at the time, Hubbard may not even have been aware that he was appropriating a Marvel comic book villain to flesh out his scriptures.


Yetrigar
Yetrigar is a Sasquatch-like being created by writer Doug Moench and artist Herb Trimpe as an adversary for Godzilla in Marvel Comics. He first appeared in Godzilla #10, where he had grown to gargantuan proportions due to being exposed to radiation. His name comes from the legendary shaggy men that some believe live in the Japanese mountains.
Yetrigar battles Godzilla in the Grand Canyon. In his encounter with Godzilla, Yetrigar proves more than a match for the legendary 'King of the Monsters' and could have perhaps even killed Godzilla had Red Ronin not interceded. Initially, Robert tries to prevent both entities from harming each other but ultimately buries Yetrigar beneath a rockslide. Ashamed of this action, Takiguchi temporarily fled in the Red Ronin robot.Attempting to get revenge on Phantom Rider, Mockingbird led the West Coast Avengers to the Grand Canyon where Hamilton Slade was working on an archaeological project. To distract her teammates while she looked for Hamilton Slade, Mockingbird set up explosives which freed Yetrigar. The Avengers' attacks on the beast proved very futile until Hank Pym placed an object in Yetrigar's ear and used the Pym Particles to enlarge the device enough to knock him unconscious.After his defeat at the hands of the Avengers, Yetrigar was remanded to the Vault. In a prologue to Acts of Vengeance, Yetrigar was seen trying to break out of his energy cell during a mass-prison break. This was thwarted by Hawkeye and Iron Man who managed to trap the other villains (namely Angar the Screamer, Cactus, Electro, Griffin, Hydro-Man, Klaw, Mister Hyde, Orka, Scarecrow, Titania, and Whirlwind) that were trying to escape.After the Vault was shut down, Yetrigar was taken someplace else. It is most likely that he was placed on Monster Isle.

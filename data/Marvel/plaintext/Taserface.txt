Marvel Cinematic Universe

Chris Sullivan portrays Taserface in media set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This version is the lieutenant of Yondu Udonta's faction of the Ravagers. Additionally, he is depicted as being proud of his name, believing it strikes fear into the hearts of his enemies. However, Rocket and the rest of the Ravagers scoff at the ridiculousness of his name. 

Taserface is introduced in the live-action film Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. After officially being assigned to direct the film Guardians of the Galaxy and considering Taserface to be "the dumbest character of all time", director James Gunn jokingly posted a photo of him on his social media. He later clarified that he would never feature the character in a film. Gunn later changed his mind, and while crafting this character, felt that Taserface had named himself. Hence, he described him as "a real dumbass", yet also "a very powerful guy." Discussing the character's look in The Art of the Film, Visual Development Illustrator Anthony Francisco says, "Taserface was described to me as needing to be very scary-looking, but he wants you to think he is the absolute coolest. I translated this into conceptualizing various things he might wear or add onto his Ravager jumpsuit â€” things that he thinks are badass or interesting. But ultimately, he is just trying too hard." Feeling that Yondu is "going soft", Taserface leads a mutiny against him and kills anyone still loyal to the former. After Kraglin aids Yondu, Rocket, and Groot in escaping from their prison cells, Yondu kills the remaining Ravagers and destroys the main engine, causing the Ravager ship to explode. While the four escape in a smaller escape ship, Taserface contacts the Sovereign to give them Yondu's coordinates before dying in the explosion.
An alternate timeline version of Taserface appears in the Disney+ animated series What If...? episode "What If... T'Challa Became a Star-Lord?", with Sullivan reprising the role.

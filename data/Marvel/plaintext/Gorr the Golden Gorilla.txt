Fictional character biography

Gorr is a golden gorilla given human intelligence and greatly increased strength by the High Evolutionary.Fearing that Galactus was about to destroy his creation Counter-Earth, the High Evolutionary created Gorr and sent him to Earth to seek the aid of the Fantastic Four. However, when he arrived on Earth, Gorr became inexplicably mutated into a King Kong-sized monstrosity and went on a rampage through Manhattan, climbing to the top of the Chrysler Building. When the Fantastic Four intervened, Gorr duped them into coming aboard his ship and transported them to Counter-Earth. The Fantastic Four, High Evolutionary, and Gorr were unable to convince Galactus not to destroy Counter-Earth, though Galactus challenged them to find a replacement within 48 hours. Gorr and the Human Torch found an Earth-like planet, which turned out to be inhabited by Skrulls. The Skrulls abandoned the planet after an altercation with Gorr, leaving the planet uninhabited and thus worthless to Galactus. Ultimately, the Impossible Man convinced Galactus to devour his own planet of Poppup instead. Gorr remained with the High Evolutionary as a "valet."Much later, Gorr became a prisoner/research project of the Stranger, held captive on his laboratory world alongside Stranger's other prisoners. When the Overmind attacked the Stranger, he freed the Stranger's captives including Gorr who escaped.

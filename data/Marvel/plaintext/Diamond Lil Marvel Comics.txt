Daniel Whitehall
Daniel Whitehall is a British intelligence agent also known as the Kraken.An elite assassin and member of the terrorist organization Hydra also used the name and debuted in Secret Warriors #2 (March 2009). Writer/artist Jonathan Hickman stated in an interview with Comic Book Resources that "Kraken" is a new character. The other Hydra character with that name [Commander Kraken] was "a real b-list character and pretty lame. Our Kraken... has a long and elaborate history and we're going to be delving into that in a major way". Kraken is a legendary Hydra agent, whose existence had been unverifiable, until recently. Any S.H.I.E.L.D. agents that tried to find documented proof all disappeared. The Kraken preferred to work behind the scenes, seeing it as his mission to help people become what they are meant to be, usually with dangerous results. For decades he was responsible for developing Hydra's best assets, training their best talent. This involved a lot of human trafficking, theft, and murder. He was the head of the school that trained orphaned girls (including a young Viper) into human weapons. The current Kraken is actually the second Kraken not Daniel Whitehall, having stolen the original's identity by taking his equipment and reading his journals.It is revealed that this second Kraken is actually Jake Fury, who had infiltrated the highest rungs of HYDRA to help his brother bring about its destruction.


Daniel Whitehall in other media
Daniel Whitehall appears in season two of the live-action Marvel Cinematic Universe television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., portrayed by Reed Diamond. This version originally went by the name Werner Reinhardt and was a member of Hydra in 1945, prior to being arrested by Peggy Carter and the Strategic Scientific Reserve. In 1989, an elderly Reinhardt was freed from life imprisonment by Hydra infiltrators within S.H.I.E.L.D. and encounters Jiaying, an Inhuman woman whom he encountered during WWII and has not aged since. He dissected her in an attempt to find out why this was and transplanted her abilities to himself; restoring him to his WWII age and unknowingly becoming the target of Jiaying's husband, Calvin Zabo's, revenge. In the present, Reinhardt took the name "Daniel Whitehall" and took over as Hydra's North American leader. He also leads an effort to acquire a Kree artifact called the "Diviner" and utilizes Johann Fenhoff's work to brainwash people into Hydra's service, during which Whitehall clashes with a S.H.I.E.L.D. team led by Phil Coulson. Whitehall is eventually killed by Coulson, depriving Zabo of his revenge. Whitehall also makes minor appearances in flashbacks depicted in the season three episode "Paradise Lost" and the season five episode "Rise and Shine".

Jefferson Davis
Jefferson Davis, also known as Jeff Morales, is a fictional character and the father of Miles Morales / Spider-Man. The character, created by Brian Michael Bendis and Sara Pichelli, first appeared in Ultimate Comics Spider-Man #1 (November 2011) as part of Marvel Comics' Ultimate Marvel line of books set in a universe and continuity separate from the "mainstream" Marvel Universe.
Jefferson is an African-American man who is married to the Puerto Rican Rio Morales. He never got along with his criminal brother Aaron Davis. Things got out of control and Jefferson wound up in jail only to be bailed out by Nick Fury. Impressed with his fighting skills, Fury had Jefferson join gangster Turk Barrett's gang for intel, eventually working his way up to Wilson Fisk's criminal empire. Afterwards, Jefferson was offered a spot in S.H.I.E.L.D. by Fury but chose to live a simple life of being a husband to Rio and father to Miles. Jefferson kept Miles from ever interacting with Aaron and keeping a strict household in an attempt to lead his son on a clean path. Despite his overall dislike of Aaron's criminal activities, Jefferson was saddened by his brother's death.During the events of United We Stand, Jefferson was arrested by S.H.I.E.L.D. only to be attacked by Hydra who attempt to get Jefferson to join, but he kills his would-be recruiters and returns home to Rio. He tells his wife what happens and they go looking for Miles, finding their son at Ganke Lee's house. Jefferson is later attacked by Conrad Marcus, putting him in the hospital. He's attacked again, but Spider-Man battles and defeats Venom at the cost of Rio's life. One year later, Jefferson discovered that Miles is Spider-Man, angering him and blaming his son for the deaths of Aaron and Rio. Jefferson apologizes and reveals his own past to his son. Jefferson's undercover life impressed both Donald Roxxon and the Green Goblin.After the events of Secret Wars, Molecule Man thanks Miles by transferring him, Ganke and both their families to the mainstream Marvel Universe, with Jefferson being reunited with Rio, who is restored to life. As they retain their memories from their original universe, restored by Gwen Poole, he and Rio learn from Miles that Aaron was also resurrected when their families (alongside most of Miles' friends) were transferred to the main universe.


Alternate version of Jefferson Davis
In the Spider-Gwen reality, he is the equivalent of Scorpion. Instead of a green suit with a large tail, he wears a suit and tie which appear to be electrically charged. Jefferson also carries a staff that resembles a scorpion tail and he seems to possess super speed. He works for an evil organization similar to Hydra, rivalling the business of the Kingpin and the Hand. Jefferson does battle with both Spider-Woman and his mainstream counterpart's son, with the latter being confused by his appearance.


Jefferson Davis in other media
Jefferson Davis appears in Spider-Man, voiced by Alex Désert. This version is initially more optimistic and has a healthy father-son relationship with Miles Morales. In the season one episode "Ultimate Spider-Man", he teaches his son to use brains over brawn to solve problems. He is saved by the Ultimate Spider-Man from two Spider-Slayers. The character is next seen as Swarm in Spider-Man: Maximum Venom, utilizing purple nanotech bees that grant him a solid form and can use their stingers to mind control human beings. In "Spider-Man Unmasked", Jefferson distracts the original Spider-Man by acquiring the Jackal's various formulas to amass an army of mutated individuals as the leader of an underground gladiatorial arena-based streaming show called the Underground Monster League for the criminal underworld. However, Jefferson neglects the task by capturing Spider-Man, Ghost-Spider, Spider-Girl and the Ultimate Spider-Man instead, who manage to escape and defeat him. In "Generations", Jefferson confronts the Ultimate Spider-Man on the Dark Goblin's behalf, revealing his determination to keep his neighborhood safe from crossfire. In the process, however, father and son discover each other's identities, causing the former to realize the error of his ways and flee in shock.
Jefferson Davis appears in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, voiced by Brian Tyree Henry. This version is a PDNY officer who has a healthy relationship with Miles Morales, but has very high expectations. Jefferson is initially unaware of Aaron Davis's criminal career as the Prowler, but is still not keen on Miles spending time with his brother. After Aaron is killed by the Kingpin, the distraught Jefferson seeks to find his brother's killer, initially believing it to be the new Spider-Man. While reconciling with Miles, he unknowingly inspires his son to master being the new Spider-Man and avenge Aaron by defeating the Kingpin. Following the Kingpin's defeat and arrest, Jefferson accepts the new Spider-Man's heroic efforts.
Jefferson Davis appears in Insomniac Games's Spider-Man series, voiced by Russell Richardson. This version is a NYPD officer with a healthy relationship with Miles Morales as well as respect and admiration for Peter Parker.
Introduced in Marvel's Spider-Man (2018), Jefferson aids in the original Spider-Man's investigation into the Kingpin's abandoned assets on Captain Yuri Watanabe's behalf and later prevents said assets from falling into rival hands. Jefferson and his family, Rio and Miles Morales, attend Norman Osborn's mayoral re-election rally, where Jefferson is lauded for his heroism until Mister Negative and the Inner Demons launch a terrorist attack. Amidst the attack, Jefferson sacrifices himself to save another officer from a suicide bomber. Miles, initially devastated by his father's death, learns to come to terms with it with help from Rio and accepts Peter's offer to work as a part-timer at a F.E.A.S.T. Center to cope with the loss further and honor his father's legacy.
In Spider-Man: Miles Morales (2020), the second Spider-Man attempts to uphold his father's crime fighting legacy. It is also revealed Jefferson had been estranged from Aaron Davis after discovering his brother was the Prowler. Jefferson agreed not to arrest Aaron, but demanded his brother stay away from his family. The brothers never reconciled before Jefferson's death, leaving Aaron deeply affected and overprotective of Miles. Jefferson also makes a vocal cameo in a flashback depicted in the main story and a side mission.
Jeff Morales appears in Spidey and His Amazing Friends, voiced by Eugene Byrd.

Leonardo would spend most of his time building technology for the Hel-Rangers to use against those who attacked the Shield. During the end of the event, Leonardo revealed to the Thing that he had built the Enlightenment Cannon which was fueled by Michelangelo's power. After the death of his friend, Michelangelo, and the discovery about the truth of life, Leonardo committed suicide.A version of Leonardo appears attacking Madison Jeffries and Broo during the Science Battle between the Avengers and X-Men.

Death-Stalker
The first Death-Stalker was Philip Wallace Sterling. An enemy of Daredevil, he first appeared as the Exterminator in Daredevil #39 (April 1968); he first appeared as Death-Stalker in Daredevil #113 (September 1974).


Fictional character biography

Philip Wallace Sterling was born in Riverdale, Bronx, New York. He was a wealthy man prior to embarking on a career as a professional criminal. When he first appeared as the Exterminator, he recruited the Unholy Three. He constructed a "time displacer ray" ("t-ray") which could teleport its target into another dimension (possibly the Limbo from which Immortus hails). The Exterminator led the Unholy Three in a series of criminal activities and battled Daredevil. When Daredevil defeated the Exterminator and his agents, he also destroyed the t-ray, accidentally bombarding the Exterminator with its strange energy and seemingly killing him.Sterling found himself trapped between two dimensions, able to return to Earth at will but only for a few hours at a time; furthermore, the mutation caused his skin to become chalk-white. He stole a pair of gloves from A.I.M. that gave him a "death-grip," and began calling himself Death-Stalker.  He tried several times to kill Daredevil and build a new t-ray machine, but most of his battles with Daredevil ended in a draw.
He was allied with the Gladiator against Daredevil. Death-Stalker traveled to the Florida Everglades in search of papers relating to Ted Sallis' experiments and encountered the Man-Thing. He later stole a set of ancient Lemurian mirror lenses from various museums and used them to create a powerful gun in order to destroy Daredevil. However, Daredevil destroyed the gun, and in the midst of their battle, Death-Stalker was mysteriously discorporated by the Sky-Walker. He reappeared in a third costumed guise as the second Death's-Head, gifting an enforcer called the Smasher with superhuman strength and kidnapping Karen Page in order to force her to give him the original Death's Head's research. He was defeated by Daredevil and the Ghost Rider, killing the Smasher with his touch during the battle.Sterling resumed the Death-Stalker identity and assembled a large gathering of criminals to take part in an undisclosed theft, presumably of t-ray components. Daredevil found out about the gathering and in the resulting confrontation Death-Stalker touched (and thus killed) one of his underlings, frightening the others away. Seeing no point in battling Daredevil at this time, he teleported away. Angered at this latest interference with his plans, he created another Smasher and sent him to kill Daredevil. The new Smasher failed and Daredevil refused to imprison him, knowing that Death-Stalker would have entered the prison and killed him for his failure. Turning to a new plan, he stole a newly developed scientific apparatus from Stark International.Death-Stalker attempted to kill Daredevil while the crime-fighter was hospitalized, but was stopped by the Avengers. He created a new Unholy Three and had them kidnap Matt Murdock, whose secret identity as Daredevil he had learned by observation from between dimensions. Daredevil was taken to St. Stephens Cemetery, where Death-Stalker killed two of the Unholy Three and attacked Daredevil. Unable to overcome Death-Stalker's superior abilities, Daredevil knocked out the nearby street light, thus enclosing the cemetery in darkness. Fighting blindly, Death-Stalker rematerialized while his body was phasing through a tombstone, which killed him instantly.Death-Stalker was, for a brief time, survived by his mother, Elizabeth Dawes Sterling. Lying on her deathbed, and in her hatred for Daredevil for the death of her son, she had her house converted into a deathtrap and built child-like androids fitted with self-destruct devices constructed to lure him to his demise. However, Daredevil just barely managed to escape her deadly revenge. Elizabeth herself died before Daredevil could be lured into the trap.


Villains for Hire
A new female Death-Stalker appeared in the first issue of Villains for Hire (the villain counterpart of Heroes for Hire). This Death-Stalker's true identity is unknown. She is among the villains hired by Purple Man to help him start his new criminal empire. Death-Stalker was almost shot in the head by Crossbones and shrugs to him by stating "you can't kill what is already dead." Death-Stalker later survives the explosion of the boat she was on.


Powers and abilities
Accidental exposure to an overdose of "t-radiation" altered Sterling's physiology, making it so that he normally existed in a dimension congruent to Earth. While in this realm, he could watch and listen to events on Earth without being observed from Earth by any means. By willing himself to do so, he could shift into the Earth dimension to varying degrees. He could become visible but intangible, or visible and tangible as he desired. He could shift from one state to the other instantaneously. Also, while completely in his interdimensional state, he could cover distances more rapidly, enabling him to disappear from one Earth location and reappear at another far sooner than if he had traversed that same distance on Earth. Death-Stalker could not continuously manifest in the dimension of Earth for more than several hours at a time. His "cybernetic death-grip" devices, stolen from A.I.M., was worn in his gloves, which emitted a dose of microwave radiation when activated by mental command, crippling or killing (depending on the duration of contact) any living creature who came into contact with it. This self-described "touch of death" energy has been described as microwaves, but seems to have properties of both lightning and truly intense cold. Death-Stalker, however, had to materialize tangibly, and in full, on Earth for the device to be effective — a "lone weakness" which Daredevil learned he could exploit to attack Sterling. There is also some evidence that Death-Stalker may have had superhuman strength, although its extent is unknown and it may have been a product of his "death-grip" devices as opposed to him actually possessing superhuman strength on his own. All in all, Philip Wallace Sterling was a brilliant criminal mastermind — running a global "espionage syndicate" — in addition to being an accomplished inventor and scientist with extensive knowledge of advanced scientific apparatus.


Death Wreck
Death Wreck was created by Craig Houston and Stewart "Staz" Johnson. He first appeared in Death Wreck #1 (January 1994). Death Wreck is a cyborg, a prototype built by A.I.M. scientist Doctor Evelyn Necker in 2018 as part of the Minion project. Constructed at short notice and considered entirely expendable, Death Wreck contains the "brain of a wino" housed within a body powered by a car engine.

Father Delgado
Father Francis Xavier Delgado is a fictional priest in Marvel Comics. The character, created by Bill Mantlo and Rick Leonardi, first appeared in Cloak and Dagger #1 (Oct. 1983).
Father Delgado preached at the Holy Ghost Church, which was located in the slums of Hell's Kitchen. He arrived at his church one day to find Cloak and Dagger, who came seeking sanctuary. After hearing their story, he chose to honor their wishes of being discreet and fed and housed them. He even led away police detective Brigid O'Reilly and defended them from the police. His church has acted as their superhero base of sorts and he has aided other superheroes like Spider-Man and the New Mutants. Later, Delgado accompanies Cloak and Dagger to visit Dagger's mother, Melissa Bowen. When she turns out to be cruel and uncaring, Dagger blights her and returns to Cloak and Delgado. Delgado is shown to detest Cloak and Dagger's vigilante efforts, but cannot stand to see them leave, particularly Dagger as he wants to "rescue" her from Cloak's "demonic" life. The duo, along with the newly transformed Brigid, who had become Mayhem, rescue Delgado from criminals who were posing as a religious group.While thankful for being rescued, Delgado still feared that Cloak and Dagger's souls were corrupted by demons. Both the congregation and Daimon Hellstrom refuse to perform an exorcism for him, so he attempts to do so himself. He is stopped by Mayhem who ridicules him for his selfishness. Ashamed, Delgado prays. When Dagger returns to the church, Delgado confronts Cloak and forces him to leave with holy water. His actions inadvertently awaken the Predator, the demon responsible for Cloak's hunger, and resurrect the spirit of Jack the Ripper. When Dagger learns that Delgado turned Cloak away, she angrily leaves him. Delgado is later taken away to a psychiatric hospital by the congregation. He is placed in a padded cell and tells Mayhem that he has lost his faith. Dagger later visits Delgado and learns that he appears to be sane; however, it is quickly revealed that he is under the control of Mister Jip, who is keeping him alive and who he sees as his God. He is visited by Dagger's uncle, Michael Bowen, who has replaced Delgado at the Holy Ghost Church. As the two pray together, Delgado secretly prays to Mister Jip and plots to kill Dagger, who he views as a temptress.He soon leaves the hospital and tells Cloak that he is feeling better now, but in actuality he is working close with Mister Jip and his assistant Night. Delgado begins working for Michael Bowen and once again feigns sanity, even when he encounters a blind Dagger from whom he must restrain himself. While sweeping the church, Delgado is visited by Ecstasy. Feeling that this is part of a test by Mister Jip, Delgado lets slip where Dagger is. Thinking he has failed, Disciplinarian enters, looking for Ecstasy. Delgado tries to fight him off, but is shot. He recuperates in the hospital, but is convinced that he has failed the Lord due to Cloak and Dagger being together again. Dagger visits him and as she is thanking him for his bravery in protecting her, he continues to plot to kill her. He is eventually released and reports to Mister Jip about Cloak and Dagger. Mister Jip breaks his promise to Delgado and takes over his body, effectively killing him.


Father Delgado in other media
Father Delgado appears in Cloak & Dagger, portrayed by Jaime Zevallos. This version is a school counselor and priest at St. Sebastian High School. Unlike his comic book counterpart, Delgado is helpful, particularly with Tyrone, and tries to dissuade him from negative thoughts. In "Back Breaker", Delgado confronts Tyrone when he lashes out to one of his classmates. He attempts to analyze him by punishing him. When Tyrone tries to leave, he sees Delgado's fear of him having either killed, or potentially kill a child due to his hidden alcoholism. After that experience, Father Delgado quotes to Tyrone "just go". Following the Terrors incident, Father Delgado was seen at Tyrone's house with Tyrone's parents and the police. At the time when Mayhem visited him in the episode "Shadow Selves", Father Delgado was shown to have resigned as a school counselor. He tells Mayhem that he does not know where Tyrone is. Father Delgado was later seen doing his preaching on the streets. Adina visits Delgado and convinces him to be a priest again so that they can help Tyrone. She confesses that, as soon as she got proof of Tyrone's innocence, she killed Connors. After Tandy and Tyrone leave New Orleans, Father Delgado moves into the abandoned church.

Marc then had his friend Frenchie keep an eye on Diatrice while he went to rescue Marlene.During his final battle against Sun King, Marc found strength in his love for Diatrice to defeat the villain.Diatrice's life was again threatened by the Société des Sadiques, whose leader Ernst wanted to indoctrinate Moon Knight, and threatened to have Diatrice killed if he didn't do as asked.After Moon Knight killed Ernst, he joined forces with the redeemed Sun King to attack the base of operations of the Société to take them down before they could hurt Diatrice. When he returned home briefly before going into battle, Diatrice handed Marc a drawing called "Diatrice and Daddy" depicting her as a grownup superhero called "Moon Girl" and older versions of her father and mother, impressing him. After her father finally defeated the Société and The Truth, Diatrice would be around him and her mother Marlene.Sometime later, the Egyptian moon god Khonshu sensed Mephisto's plans for world domination, leading Marc to leave his family and fight by his god's side to prevent that from coming true. When Khonshu succumbed to madness, however, Marc had to turn against him and help the Avengers defeat him.Following Khonshu's imprisonment, Marlene took Diatrice overseas and told Marc to leave them alone, claiming he was dangerous.

Dopinder
Dopinder is a fictional cab driver appearing in the X-Men film series. The character, created by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, first appeared in Deadpool where he was portrayed by Karan Soni. He reappears in Deadpool 2.
Dopinder is a man of Indian descent who makes a living as a taxi cab driver. One day, he picks up Deadpool who, uncomfortable with sitting in the back seat, moves to the front and starts a conversation with Dopinder about where he is going and why. The two end up forming an unusual friendship as Dopinder seems to bluntly accept Deadpool's violent lifestyle. Dopinder was initially engaged to a woman named Gita who, unfortunately for Dopinder, is in love with his cousin Bandhu who Dopinder describes as being "as dishonorable as he is attractive." At Deadpool's somewhat indirect suggestion, Dopinder kidnaps Bandhu and ties him up in the trunk of his taxi cab. An amused Deadpool supports Dopinder's action while feigning condemnation, as he was riding with Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead at the time, covertly advising Dopinder to kill his competition. Later, distracted by a cellphone call from Deadpool, Dopinder stops his cab suddenly and is rear-ended by another vehicle, crushing the trunk and causing Bandhu to scream in pain.
In the film's sequel, Dopinder continues driving Deadpool to his various contracts and missions while hoping to become a contract killer himself (confirming that he managed to successfully yet indirectly kill Bandhu) as he's envious of Deadpool's lifestyle. He begins working as a janitor at Sister Margaret's School for Wayward Children, but Deadpool and Weasel refuse to have him join in any missions. Dopinder continues showing up to aid Deadpool, but chickens out upon seeing Juggernaut. Dopinder soon returns to use his taxi to kill the mutant-hating Essex Center headmaster, getting his first thrill from actually killing somebody on purpose.

Drake next teams up with the foreign assassin Chakane in a plot to use Protectors, enhanced and mindless mercenaries, for the assassination of Symkaria's king. The Protectors are defeated by Spider-Man, Paladin and Silver Sable but Drake's resources prevent any prosecution. Afterwards, Drake used the Tri-Sentinel for his clientele's protection. While performing a "field test" against Spider-Man and Nova, the Tri-Sentinel is unresponsive to his controls and went on a rampage. With nothing else to lose, Drake has his men gather all the data and once again evade capture. Drake briefly teams up with Justin Hammer and Jonas Hale in an effort to steal superpowers for their own nefarious purposes, but are stopped by Spider-Man and the New Warriors.Drake uses the Venom symbiote to create five new symbiote "children" (Scream, Phage, Agony, Lasher and Riot) which he bonds to his employees.

Drake later wakes up as a noticeably younger-looking human, swearing revenge against the ones who defeated him.Years later, Drake is Senator Arthur Krane's campaign manager to inform about the threats symbiotes cause.

Frank Drake
Frank Drake is a fictional character, a direct descendant of Count Dracula (via a marriage from before he became a vampire). The character first appeared in Tomb of Dracula #1 and was created by Gene Colan and Gerry Conway.Frank Drake is a former millionaire who had squandered his inheritance and had nothing more than an ancestral castle in Transylvania. Planning to sell it, he and his friends travel to the castle, and discover Dracula's skeleton. They accidentally resurrect him, and Drake narrowly escapes death. Drake eventually relocates to London.Broke and in despair, Drake attempts to commit suicide but was saved by Rachel van Helsing and Taj Nital, two vampire hunters. The two, along with Quincy Harker, were dedicated to killing Dracula and his vampiric followers. Drake joins the group under van Helsing and Harker's tutelage. Drake soon encounters Blade, with whom Drake constantly clashed but would eventually befriend. Later, Drake and Brother Voodoo battle zombies sent by Dracula. Drake, Blade, Van Helsing, Harker, and Harold H. Harold help Dracula battle Doctor Sun.Quincy Harker eventually made the ultimate sacrifice by detonating a bomb concealed in his wheelchair which destroyed him, Dracula, and much of the castle in which they met for the last time. Drake and Van Helsing discovered Harker's wheelchair, and the supposed death of Dracula. Quincy's final letter to Rachel and Frank urged the two of them to grow closer together and discover what they all knew was there all the time. As a result, Frank and Rachel did attempt a romance but due to Frank's later account, Rachel was an empty shell without Dracula to fight and the two shortly parted but not without deep regrets. Rachel would eventually be turned into a vampire herself and die mercifully at the hands of X-Man Wolverine.Frank, upon hearing of Rachel's death realizes that Dracula is back and teams up with Blade, Hannibal King, and Doctor Strange to fight his return from the grave. Drake, King, Blade and Strange battled Dracula and the Darkholders, and were responsible for casting the Montesi Formula which destroyed Dracula and all vampires and banished vampirism from earth. Drake, King (now cured of vampirism and the only vampire to survive the Montesi spell), and Blade decided to remain together and become private investigators, founding the firm of King, Drake, and Blade (aka Borderline Investigations). They would investigate any number of strange and not so strange cases, including a battle with the Darkholders. In their first appearance, Doctor Strange helped them battle the Darkholders.Drake, wishing for a more normal life, eventually left the firm. Apparently, the friendship between King, Drake, and Blade had soured. Drake moved to Washington D.C. and married Marlene McKenna, a woman he had met sometime after parting ways with Rachel. During this time, Marlene seemed to come under the power of Dracula and scarred her face to resemble Rachel's facial scars. Drake, reluctantly called a hostile Blade and the two, assisted by Blade's friend Katinka, eventually aborted Dracula's resurrection again. This resulted in Blade's nervous breakdown and institutionalization. Drake, determined to live a normal life with Marlene, declined an invitation from Katinka, to stay in touch. Katinka suspected that things were only beginning.
With the weakening of the Montesi spell, Dr. Strange realized that not only were vampires returning, but also an increased occurrence of supernatural invasions. On this realization, Strange arranged for the release of Blade and for Drake (whose wife Marlene had again mysteriously fallen ill), to meet him and King back at their old Borderline offices where King, who had been running the business by himself had to eventually close shop due to the return of his vampirism. None of them too glad to see the other, but each having their reasons for getting back together, they form the Nightstalkers; by day, they are private investigators, by night, they fight any number of supernatural villains. Drake, armed with an anti-supernatural nanotech gun named Linda (after Linda Blair of The Exorcist) fights alongside Blade and King against various occult enemies. 'Linda' was engineered from Frank's blue prints by 'Silcon' Valle, a computer technician at M.I.T.In their first mission, the Nightstalkers are hired by Lilith to kill the second Ghost Rider and John Blaze, and battled Meatmarket. Ghost Rider and Blaze then joined the Nightstalkers, Strange, and the Darkhold Redeemers in battling Lilith and her Lilin. The Nightstalkers also battled HYDRA's DOA. Alongside the Punisher, the Nightstalkers battled Shiv and Casim. The Nightstalkers, with Ghost Rider, battled Stonecold. The Nightstalkers next battled Morbius, and battled Stonecold again.The Lilin are children of Lilith, an ancient demonic being. The Nightstalker's involvement with her brings them into the group known as the Midnight Sons. This includes Dan Ketch (Ghost Rider), Michael Badilino (Vengeance), John Blaze (A previous incarnation of Ghost Rider), Morbius, the Living Vampire and Victoria Montesi and her team dubbed "The Darkhold Redeemers". Doctor Strange offered frequent guidance to the group, and they also teamed with other heroes like Spider-Man. In one of the many adventures involving this team, Drake helps deal with Blade, who temporarily goes insane due to the use of the Darkhold.
Eventually, they fight against the Atlantean vampire Varnae in which Drake overloads Linda causing an explosion that is thought to destroy him and Varnae (King having attempted to sacrifice himself by plunging a metal stake through his heart while fighting off vampire-lord Varnae's mental control). Blade escapes believing them to be dead but eventually runs into King in New Orleans who explains that Drake also survived but was left horribly scarred and crippled in both body and mind and would probably remain only a shell of his former self.
Frank Drake is a capable hand-to-hand combatant, and an experienced marksman. He has been known to carry conventional handguns.  He also possesses a nano-tech weapon capable of disrupting occult energies, which he calls Linda.

Dreaming Celestial
The Dreaming Celestial (Tiamut the Communicator) is a Celestial that first appeared in The Eternals #18 (December 1977). Created by Jack Kirby, his origins were added in stories written by others and published decades later. Within the context of the stories, the Dreaming Celestial is a renegade Celestial named Tiamut. He claims that during the Second Host to visit Earth, he resisted the Host's decision to not turn the Earth over to the Horde and was exiled and his spirit trapped in the "Vial". This remains sealed under the Diablo Range in California until it is discovered by Ghaur who temporarily releases the Dreaming Celestial's power. He is reawakened by the Deviants and acts as a beacon for the Horde as he proceeds to "judge" Earth. This leads to his confrontation with Fulcrum and his ascending from the state of being a Celestial.Wanting to get behind the depowerment of most of the mutants, the High Evolutionary provided Magneto with a suit to replicate his powers so that he can provide a diversion for the High Evolutionary to obtain an item that is inside the Dreaming Celestial.


Fictional character biography
Tiamut the Communicator whose function was to alert the Fulcrum of the findings of the Celestials during planetary examinations and to send a signal to the Horde to collect the planet's aggregate life-force.
Tiamut was one of the ten members of the First Celestial Host when it visited Earth one million years ago. During this visit, Tiamut personally created the Eternal Makkari, designing him for speed and with several other interesting features in his DNA structure. It is said by some that the Deviant conqueror known as Lord Tantalus from the planet Arqa was created more than 25,000 years ago by the Dreaming Celestial but this has not been confirmed.
During the Second Celestial Host, the Deviants were the dominant force on Earth, and Tiamut was ready to call the Horde to begin the harvesting of the planet. However, Arishem had that order canceled, and had many of the Deviants culled, while not touching the other species. As this was a violation of their protocol, Tiamut deemed Arishem to be malfunctioning and tried to assume command by attacking Arishem. Although Tiamut defeated Arishem, he was then attacked by four other Celestials who had been working with Arishem, and he was imprisoned underneath the mountains. Why they did this though, is still not truly clear, and mention must be made of the fact that this account of events was given by the Dreaming Celestial itself and has not yet been rebutted or verified. It should also be noted that, by giving this account to Makkari, the Dreaming Celestial contradicted his previous claim that he could not explain why the other Celestials had put him to sleep because the reason involved concepts for which Makkeri had no referent.
It was after being defeated and imprisoned that Tiamut's true name was supposedly obliterated forever so that he would only be spoken of as the Dreaming Celestial.
One of the Exterminators killed the Dreaming Celestial during their attempt to invade the Multiverse.


Powers and abilities
Tiamut the Communicator possess the power of cosmic energy control with an unknown upper limit. His armour is able to easily withstand strikes from nuclear warheads and planetary impacts. Tiamut seems to be one of the most powerful Celestials as Galactus feared it and Uatu the Watcher could not see anything when it awoke.


In other media
Tiamut appears in the live-action Marvel Cinematic Universe film Eternals. In the film, the reversal of the Blip resulted in Earth reaching the necessary population for Tiamut to emerge. However, his emergence is prevented by the Eternals, who join in a Uni-Mind, giving Sersi enough power to turn him into marble.

Michael Duffy was the superior of Steve Rogers and James Barnes who were secretly Captain America and Bucky. He had a short temper and was always getting after his soldiers for "goldbricking". He was always picking on Rogers and Barnes for not being heroes, an ironic claim as he was unaware of their dual identities. He had nearly put two and two together, but would later deny the possibility. At one point, Duffy showed remorse when he thought that Rogers and Barnes had died in a Japanese air raid, only to go back to berating them when he found out they were alive. He also had a crush on Betsy Ross though this was retconned to show that he had a lover overseas named Flo. While out on a mission, Duffy and several soldiers were caught in an explosion. He survived and was recuperating in a hospital. Due to his lack of appearances afterwards, it's implied that he stayed in bed for the remainder of the war. Years later, Rogers would visit Arlington National Cemetery to see his former commander's grave stone and reminisce on old times.

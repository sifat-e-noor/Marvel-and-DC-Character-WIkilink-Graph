Katrina Luisa Van Horn
Katrina Luisa Van Horn was an Olympic skier and is a militant feminist. After engaging in an argument with anti-Women's Liberation skier Karl Lubbings, the two took their disagreement to the slopes. Katrina was an Olympic-level skier, but Lubbings cut her off and both skiers plunged off the mountain. Katrina was severely injured and disfigured. She was fitted with a powered exoskeleton and took the name Man-Killer (she no longer wears the exoskeleton so it is probable her strength has been enhanced somehow). She has worked freelance and as an agent for HYDRA.Man-Killer has been a member of the Masters of Evil under the Crimson Cowl.As Amazon, she was briefly a member of the Thunderbolts under Hawkeye.She had fought Spider-Man on some occasions.During an altercation with the Thunderbolts, Katrina told Songbird that she'd rather not fight her, as she had no problems with women, just with men (Songbird attacked her anyway). Some time later however, Erik Josten (Atlas of the Thunderbolts) discovered Katrina working as a bartender in his team's adopted home of Burton Canyon, Colorado. When Josten became a regular at the bar Katrina was congenial towards him, pretending not to recognize him as Atlas. Whatever animosity Katrina may or may not bear towards men, she has proven herself capable of working alongside them with a minimum of personality conflicts.Man-Killer is seen to be among the new recruits for Camp H.A.M.M.E.R.Man-Killer later appears as part of Baron Helmut Zemo's third incarnation of the Masters of Evil where they attacked the Winter Soldier's incarnation of the Thunderbolts. During the "Opening Salvo" part of the Secret Empire storyline, Man-Killer was involved in the Masters of Evil's next fight with the Thunderbolts which ends in her apparent death at the hands of Kobik.

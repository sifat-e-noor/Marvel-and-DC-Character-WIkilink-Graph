Other versions


Ultimate Marvel
In the Ultimate Marvel Comics universe, Perun is a member of The Liberators, described simply as a "Soviet Thor." His Ultimate universe appearance is vastly different from his mainstream appearance; he is clean-shaven and has no visible head hair. His powers are seemingly derived from a force-belt similar to that of Thor. Like his mainstream Marvel counterpart, he carries a hammer and sickle (the latter of which was dropped by Gregory Stark for loss of Soviet symbolism, but decided to keep the hammer to be Fury's own Thor).Alongside the other members of The Liberators, Perun attacks and rapidly subdues the forces of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the weakened Ultimates. Strategic locales all across the United States are taken. The Liberators kill thousands of soldiers and citizens alike. Perun personally incapacitates Quicksilver with a lightning strike.Perun and the Crimson Dynamo attack Air Force One capturing U.S. President George W. Bush. The plane and the passengers are brought back to the White House in Washington D.C. This is where most of Perun's teammates are killed in battle. He is seen wandering the streets, trying to find someone to surrender to.He can also be seen in the cover of Ultimate Comics: Avengers #1. Despite their invasion failing, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Nick Fury, and Dr. Gregory Stark decided to give Perun a second chance, instead of him being executed in his home country. Perun was spared a chance for Avengers operation, but is later killed by a vampiric Nerd Hulk (a clone of Hulk) in Ultimate Avengers 3. His hammer is later used by Captain America in a last-ditch effort to save the Triskelion and its inhabitants, using the hammer to teleport it to Iran. With all the vampires dead thanks to sunlight, Captain America then beheads the vampiric Hulk clone in retribution.

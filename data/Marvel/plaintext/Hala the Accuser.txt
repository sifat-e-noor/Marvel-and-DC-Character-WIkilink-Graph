Even though Thing knocked Hala the Accuser unconscious, Drax the Destroyer unknowingly activated a failsafe in Hala the Accuser's Universal Weapon enabling her to regain conscious and gain the upper hand against the Guardians of the Galaxy. She then placed Emperor Peter Quill in an escape pod so that he could watch Hala the Accuser destroy Spartax as she also planned to do the same thing to Earth as part of her revenge for his part in the near-genocide of the Kree. As Hala the Accuser continued wreaking havoc on Spartax, she defeated the Spartax Royal Guards before she realized that the Guardians of the Galaxy had retreated and regrouped. As Gamora sacrificed herself to confront Hala the Accuser, she bought the rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy time for them to get away and rescue Peter Quill. Upon realizing that Peter Quill was no longer in her grasp, Hala the Accuser continued beating up Gamora in order to get the information on what she did with him. In the nick of time, the rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy arrived in an attempt to talk Hala the Accuser out of destroying Spartax.

The Spartax Council decided to deport Hala the Accuser back to what remained of the Kree Empire.

Eli Bard
Eli Bard aka Eliphas is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Christopher Yost, Clayton Crain and Craig Kyle, Bard is a member of the Purifiers and an enemy of the X-Men.
Eli Bard was born "Eliphas" at the height of the Roman Empire. He was recognized as an outstanding soldier until a spear injury ended his military career. For a while he worked unsuccessfully as a poet until he met Aurelia, one of the most powerful women in Rome. He soon married her and achieved a position in the Senate. As a well-respected senator, he was known as a great orator and a friend to the army. His wife left him for a general named Mascius and conspired to give Mascius his seat in the Senate.Left with nothing, Eliphas was approached by Selene, who offered him immortality in exchange for helping her kill and absorb every soul in Rome. Eliphas drew pentagrams and performed rituals at several locations in the city, but warned a small girl to get her family out. The girl's father alerted the authorities and Eliphas and Selene were captured before the spell could be carried out. Just before they were burned at the stake, Selene killed the guards. She cursed Eliphas for his perceived betrayal with an eternal life of torture, turning him into a vampire-like creature. Eliphas was buried alive for 700 years until a farmer discovered him in his field. Eliphas killed the farmer with a swift bite to the jugular. He spent the next several hundred years searching for Selene. He ran into the ancestral Apache tribe of Warpath. They recognized him as a vampire but could not stop him from wiping out almost the entire tribe.Eliphas, having at some point in time changed his name to "Eli Bard," finally located Selene in Nova Roma, where she was worshiped as a god. Still in love with her despite her curse, Bard realized that he must make an offering to her before approaching her. Bard later joined the Purifiers, an anti-mutant terrorist group. During this time, he worked diligently to further the Purifiers' goals. Secretly, however, he had hoped to sacrifice thousands of Purifiers' souls using the same ritual from Rome to gain Selene's attention. He assisted in the resurrection of Bastion but the android was suspicious of him, as he had no record on him. After seeing Bastion reprogram an offspring of Magus, he changed his plan and instead re-animated the corpses in the burial grounds of the Apache tribe that he had decimated decades earlier using the Technarch transmode virus he had absorbed from an offspring of Magus. Among the bodies reanimated were those of the mutants Caliban and Thunderbird. He presented Caliban to Selene and stated that he intended to use Caliban's mutant tracking abilities to track down deceased mutants and reanimate them to form an army for Selene, an offer which she accepted.He uses the virus to resurrect a variety of mutants, including Cypher, Banshee, the original Hellions, Risque, Pyro, and Destiny.
When Bard returned to Proudstar's tribe's burial grounds to resurrect Caliban and Thunderbird, the spirits of the tribe rose to protect those buried there. Bard attacked them with Selene's mystical knife, transforming them into a Demon Bear. After fleeing the battle, Bard leaves the blade behind, unaware it was pivotal in Selene's plans. He is then dispatched to Utopia to retrieve it, taking Warpath hostage in the process. When he returns to Selene with the blade and the hostage, Selene kills him by stabbing him in the heart with the blade, reducing him to bones.

Basil Elks

Basil Elks is a petty thief who breaks into a museum to steal what he believes is an ordinary emerald - but is in fact an alien Kree artifact called the Alpha Stone. Elks, however, miscalculates the security guards rounds and is caught and fired upon when he reaches for a weapon. The guard's bullet accidentally hits and shatters the gem, causing an explosion that transforms Elks into a humanoid reptilian - his skin becomes green and scaly and his eyes are now large and red. Elks then flash-freezes the guard in place, and realizing that he now has superhuman abilities, decides to become a supervillain and calls himself the Basilisk. He faced off against Spider-Man, Mister Fantastic, Captain Marvel and the Mole Man which ended with him being imprisoned in another Kree artifact called the Omega Stone that ended up in lava.The Omega Stone he was imprisoned in was found in a lava river by some Moloids who worshiped it. After absorbing the Omega Stone into himself (thus increasing his power to its fullest potential) and breaking free, he fought the Thing and defeated him until Spider-Man arrived. After hearing the Basilisk's origin, Spider-Man manages to help the Thing regain consciousness and they fight the Basilisk. During the fight, the Basilisk disappeared during a cave-in.The Sphinx pulled the Basilisk from his timeline and paired him up with Moonstone, Ulysses Bloodstone, the Man-Wolf and Gyre to compete against the Sphinx's elder self and his team consisting of Black Bolt, Darkhawk, Mister Fantastic, Namorita, and Nova.The Basilisk reappeared in the crossover storyline involving the Scourge of the Underworld, a vigilante who assassinated numerous minor supervillains. Seeking retaliation against the Thing, the character tunneled his way to the headquarters of the Fantastic Four which was undergoing construction, but was murdered by the Scourge of the Underworld disguised as a construction worker.Dead Ringer later acquired a tissue sample from the Basilisk's body and assumed his form.During the "Dark Reign" storyline, the Basilisk was resurrected - along with 16 other criminals murdered by the Scourge - by master criminal the Hood using the power of the entity Dormammu. The revived characters form a squad to attempt to eliminate the Punisher; the Basilisk completed the mission by capturing the Punisher.During the "Fear Itself" storyline, the Basilisk is among the villains that escape from the Raft after the Juggernaut takes the form of Kuurth: Breaker of Stone and damages the facility heavily. He assists the Man-Bull, the Griffin, and another escaped inmate in a bank robbery. When Hercules arrives, he recognizes that the fourth person with them is actually Hecate. The Basilisk joined the Man-Bull and the Griffin in fighting Hercules until Hecate regained her memories. When a revived Kyknos attacks Hercules, the Basilisk and the Man-Bull flee. Hercules and the Griffin manage to find where the Basilisk and the Man-Bull are hiding and recruit their help. The villains approach Hecate and Kyknos using a ruse involving Hercules being turned to stone. Hercules quickly revives and saves the villains by killing Kyknos, while Hecate escapes.The Basilisk was later hired by HYDRA where he was paired up with the Looter to steal the Ellsworth Sonic Reducer. Both of them are defeated by the Superior Spider-Man (Otto Octavius's mind in Spider-Man's body) and are webbed up for the police.


Wayne Gifford

Wayne Gifford is a dysfunctional person who turns to demon-worshipping to create an alternate persona, the Basilisk. Possessing a paralyzing stare, the Basilisk battles the anti-hero Morbius the Living Vampire.


Mike Columbus

Mike Columbus is a mutant and a student at the Xavier Institute. Possessing limited intelligence and persecuted in his youth due to his abnormal appearance (bald, abnormally large and with one eye), the character is extremely aggressive. Once the Basilisk's mutant power manifests, he suffers from brain seizures until given a device to help regulate the ability.
The Basilisk joins the Brotherhood of Mutants. They take over New York City. While watching human prisoners march by, he makes a joke about a perceived bad smell. The Brotherhood's leader Magneto attempts to deliver a punishment, but kills the Basilisk instead.


Powers and abilities
Upon absorbing the Alpha Stone, Basil Elks possessed enhanced physical strength, reflexes, and stamina. The Basilisk's main offensive weapon were his eye beams, which could be concussive force (these could also be directed at the ground for limited flight) or energy that manipulated temperature (to boiling or freezing extremes) or molecules. Upon absorbing the Omega Stone, Basilisk's powers increased to their full extent, allowing him to generate volcanoes worldwide, including in the Savage Land and New York City.Wayne Gifford was a normal human until becoming the Basilisk, a large humanoid reptile. The creature possesses superhuman strength and agility, and a paralyzing stare. The Basilisk's one weakness is its reflection, which serves as a reminder of its former state.
Mike Columbus possesses an overly-fleshy head devoid of all features except for sunken ears, a slit-like mouth, and a single centered eye socket. A camera-like device is located in this socket that allows the Basilisk to control his superhuman mutant ability to emit a pulse of high-frequency strobe light from his brain. The light paralyzes any sentient being that views it, while the length of the effect varies depending upon the willpower of the onlooker.

Donald Blake

Dr. Donald "Don" Blake is the fictional doctor identity of Marvel Comics character Thor. The character, created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, first appeared in Journey into Mystery #83 (August 1962).
Donald Blake is a construct of Odin, created for the purpose of giving a weak and powerless identity for Thor. After removing his memory, Thor started his life as the crippled Don who chose to be a doctor after sympathizing with the sick. Don finds the hammer Mjolnir and transforms into the God of Thunder. Later, Don regains his memory as Thor and soon learns the whole truth from Odin. The Blake identity has been used here and there before Odin opted to erase him from existence. After Thor was killed by The Serpent, Donald Blake suddenly came into existence as a separate entity fully aware that his whole life had been a lie. Under the alias of the Dragon, Blake conducted a deadly campaign against Odin, the former All-Father of Asgard, and targeted all those blessed by Odin's magic. After an epic battle, Blake is defeated, but demands that Odin kill him, declaring that he'll never allow himself to be imprisoned again. While Odin is ready to carry out the deed, Loki and Thor work together to stop him, recognizing Blake as their brother and, like Loki, someone who has suffered from being brought into their dysfunctional family. Nevertheless, Blake caused a huge amount of suffering and remains dangerous, so Thor hands him over to Loki, who accepts the responsibility of dealing with the brother their father forgot. Blake is chained in a dungeon, with a venomous serpent forever hovering above him, dripping its poison into his eyes, the same punishment Loki has suffered in the past. Loki then officially renounce his title as the God of Lies, passing it to Blake.

Blood Spider
The Blood Spider (Michael Bingham) is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man #367 (October 1992), created by writer David Michelinie and artist Jerry Bingham.
Blood Spider is a mercenary trained by Taskmaster under contract by the Red Skull to create a team of mercenaries who would be capable of defeating Spider-Man. The trio were patterned after the superheroes Captain America, Hawkeye and Spider-Man, and the characters were called Death-Shield, Jagged Bow and Blood Spider.Solo joined the fray on the side of the wall-crawler and helps to defeat the three villains and thwart Red Skull's machinations who was using the mercenaries to guard private files sought by Spider-Man in reference to his parents.Years later, Blood Spider appears with Death-Shield and Jagged Bow among the criminals vying for the multi-million dollar bounty that was placed on Agent Venom's head by Lord Ogre. The trio's attempt on Agent Venom's life is interrupted by competing mercenaries Constrictor and Lord Deathstrike.Crime Master, with the help of Blood Spider, Death-Shield and Jagged Bow, later tries to steal a damaged Rigellian Recorder from Deadpool and the Mercs for Money.Of the trio, Blood Spider was the only character who displayed any superhuman abilities. He was able to shatter a solid concrete wall with a very powerful move, indicating he possessed some degree of superhuman strength. He was not as powerful as Spider-Man, and not nearly as fast. He carried a back pack and wrist devices capable of shooting webbing similar to that of Spider-Man, but much weaker. An ordinary human in peak physical condition, such as Solo, was able to tear through it, which would not have been possible with Spider-Man's webbing. Blood Spider's costume has several design elements that Bagley would later incorporate into the redesign of Ben Reilly's Spider-Man costume. The most prominent of the traits is the use of a larger, symmetrical spider emblem on the front and back, the legs of which meet on the shoulders.

Bloodwraith
Bloodwraith (Sean Dolan) is a fictional character in the Marvel Comics universe. He was created by Mark Gruenwald, Dann Thomas, Roy Thomas and Tony DeZuniga, and first appeared in Black Knight #2 (July 1990).
Bloodwraith is the murderous enemy of Black Knight and the Avengers. While Sean Dolan was known as Bloodwraith, Bloodwraith is made up of the souls of those the Ebony Blade has slain. He is an expert swordsman compelled to take lives, especially innocent lives. The blade is indestructible and able to cut through almost any material. The blade was forged from a meteorite and Merlin's magic. The blade can trap dead souls and absorb or deflect all kinds of energies and mystical power. Bloodwraith can sense the ebony blade and control it like a telekinetic. If separated, Bloodwraith can teleport to the Ebony Blade or teleport the blade to himself. Bloodwraith rides a winged horse named Valinor.
Sean Dolan was an amateur swordsman with no special abilities. When Sean drew the ebony blade, he found himself overwhelmed and controlled by all the souls of those the sword had slain, and became the Bloodwraith. The Bloodwraith was dark black in color and appeared in costume. The sword constantly craved new blood to add, and those it slew found their souls locked in an eternal battle of good vs. evil in a dimension inside the sword. Bloodwraith rides his winged horse, Valinor, and is an expert swordsman. He can control the ebony blade rather like a telekinetic. When separated from the blade, he can sense its presence and instantaneously teleport to its location. The ebony blade could slice through anything and, previously, would curse its wielder with petrification if its wielder used the blade to draw blood. When he wielded Proctor's sword, the Bloodwraith and Valinor appeared much more skeletal and could channel powerful blasts through the sword. When powered by the Slorenian souls, Bloodwraith became composed of an energy unknown to man, and both he and the sword grew to gigantic size.

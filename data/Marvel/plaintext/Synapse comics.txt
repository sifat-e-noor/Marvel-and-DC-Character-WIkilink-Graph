Taking on the name Synapse he, along with La Concierge and Stilt-Man, were recruited by the Kingpin to form the third incarnation of the Emissaries of Evil. One of the first things he did was shut down Stilt-Man's brain, albeit temporarily, so that he would not reveal his employer's name to Daredevil, who at the time was acting as an agent for S.H.I.E.L.D. and had his mind wiped to think he was Laurent Levasseur.While La Concierge was battling Laurent, Synapse was holding Dr. Claudia DuBois hostage along with Wilson Fisk. Tired of being pushed around, Synapse planned on using his powers on Fisk, but Fisk, who had a stronger mind, knew of Synapse's plot and threatened to kill him if he did not continue to work under him. Eventually, Fisk has Synapse use his powers on Laurent, but it instead reminds him that he is Daredevil. He knocks out Synapse with one kick.

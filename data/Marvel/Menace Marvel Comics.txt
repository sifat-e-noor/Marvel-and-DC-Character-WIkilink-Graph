== Mad Jim Jaspers ==
'''Sir James "Mad Jim" Jaspers''' is a character in [[American comic books]] seen in [[Marvel Comics]]. He was created by [[Alan Moore]], David Thorpe and [[Alan Davis]] for [[Marvel UK]]. He is a powerful supervillain who was the archenemy of [[Captain Britain]] and [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] as well as a few other heroes as well as the main antagonist of the Excalibur series.

In the reality of Earth-238,<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes'' #377</ref> James Jaspers, a British politician waged a political war on mutants. He had been elected into office as a member of the English Parliament because of his anti mutant and anti super heroes stance and politics, however Jaspers was a mutant himself with powerful reality-warping abilities. His political façade and motivations for the elimination of his fellow mutants and superheroes was essentially to ensure his supremacy. Jaspers seemed a gifted politician and adapt at swaying popular public opinion, with lines such as "if they were honest they wouldn't wear masks" but whether he was always mad, or descended into madness with the advent of his mutant reality warping powers, Jaspers had lost his sanity. Jaspers of Earth-238 was so determined to rid his world of mutants, he began to move beyond drumming up anti-mutant sentiment and constructed an incredibly powerful adaptive cybernetic construct known simply as [[Fury (Marvel Comics)|the Fury]] to hunt and eliminate all superpowered beings.

Jaspers had also formed an advanced technological equipped military task force charged with eliminating super powered beings, this group known as the Status Crew. Typically the Status Crew would round up powered beings to be held in concentration camps with their extermination there not long after. The Fury would deal with bigger threats. It would take less than two years for super powered beings to be on the verge of extinction. The Fury had been programmed by Jaspers to allow Jaspers to live as the sole powered being.

Unmatched in power by any other being, any potential threats ruthlessly destroyed by the Fury, Jaspers adopted the persona of Mad Jim Jaspers, a bank robber and crook paying homage to the [[Mad Hatter]] from [[Alice in Wonderland]] as well as continuing the [[Lewis Carroll]] book theme with his own bank robbing crew, the Crazy Gang. It was around this time that the Omniversal Guardian Merlyn aware of not just this reality's version of Jaspers danger to the multiverse, but the Jim Jaspers of the 616 reality who Merlyn realized possessed even greater reality warping power. Merlyn would teleport one of the few remaining super heroes of Earth-238, Captain UK Linda McQuillan, to the 616 designated reality. Importantly he would also do so whilst she was being observed by the deadly cybiote the Fury. The Earth of 238 would fall into disarray due to the mad machinations and reality warping of Jaspers. It had become known as a crooked earth. Of similar concern was that the Jaspers of 616 had begun his political ascension, a worrying sign of things to come.<ref>''Daredevils'' #7</ref>

Upon returning to mainstream reality/616, Captain Britain found that another Sir James Jaspers was leading an anti-superhero campaign, with the aid of [[Henry Peter Gyrich]] and [[Sebastian Shaw (character)|Sebastian Shaw]], members of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]].

Jaspers managed to win a landslide general election victory on his anti-superhero platform and became Prime Minister of Britain. Events began to mirror those of Earth-238 and Jaspers unleashed the force of the Jaspers Warp upon London, causing much chaos and devastation. However, Jaspers found himself under attack from the reality-hopping Fury, and the two engage in a large-scale reality-warping battle in which Jaspers was ultimately killed by the Fury, who teleported him outside the universe, where he would have no reality to control and thus be rendered powerless.

The character, created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Dave Cockrum]], first appeared in ''The [[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #107 (October 1977). Magique has the ability to create realistic illusions.

Along with [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]], [[Mentor (Imperial Guard)|Mentor]], and Quasar (later known as [[Neutron (Marvel Comics)|Neutron]]), Magic was one of the founding members of the Imperial Guard, brought together centuries earlier by T'korr, Majestor of the Shi'ar Empire, for the purpose of stopping Rook'shir, who has been driven insane by the malevolent force known as the [[Dark Phoenix]], and was laying waste to the galaxy.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #479.

After Lilandra's sister [[Deathbird]] stages a coup and becomes the new Shi'ar Empress, the Guard comes into conflict with a rogue Space Knight named Pulsar (not the Imperial Guard member Impulse, who later changes his name to [[Pulsar (Marvel Comics)|Pulsar]]) and an alien named Tyreseus.

'''Maha Yogi''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]]. He first appeared in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #96 (September 1963), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

Yogi was apparently born 10,000 years ago in what is now Central Europe. He apparently was a savage that came to possess some portion of the same Bloodgem that [[Ulysses Bloodstone]] would later possess, which gave him immortality and eternal youth. He later came to Britain during the time of Camelot, and impersonated the real [[Merlin (Marvel Comics)#Merlin of Legend|Merlin]] while he was away. The [[Eternal (comics)|Eternal]] [[Sersi]] exposed the impostor, and the real Merlin placed him in suspended animation.<ref>origin revealed in ''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #210</ref>

The false Merlin was revived in modern times, still posing as Merlin, and battled and was defeated by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], after which he went back into the coffin.<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #96</ref> He later became a professional criminal and took the name '''Warlock''', organizing a band of armored mercenaries. He abducted [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]], battled the original [[X-Men]], and was rendered comatose by [[Professor X]].<ref>''X-Men'' #30</ref>

Later, as the mentalist '''Maha Yogi''', he attempted to create an army of mind-slaves. He fought and was defeated by the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]].<ref>''X-Men'' #47</ref> The Maha Yogi then became the chairman of Merlin Industries. With Mongu, the Maha Yogi plotted world conquest, but was defeated by the [[Hulk]] and [[Doctor Druid]]. During his encounter with the Hulk, his fragment of the Bloodgem was destroyed and he rapidly aged into helplessness.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #210–211</ref> Some time later, the Maha Yogi was revealed to have been created by the Caretakers of Arcturus and to have turned against them.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 3 #27</ref> He later appeared alive with his youth apparently restored by unknown means.<ref>''The Avengers'' Annual #22</ref>

As a result of mutation induced by the Caretakers of Arcturus, the Maha Yogi had the psionic abilities to control the minds of others, create illusions, project psionic force bolts, levitate objects as large as a building, teleport himself, create force fields and alter his own appearance. His psionic powers have a limited range.

Thanks to his possession of a fragment of the Bloodstone, the Maha Yogi is virtually immortal, and has a physically malleable body.

He has attempted to use true magic, performing a ritual to summon the demon known as Grendel's Mother.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol. 5 #20–21</ref>

The Earth-982 version of Mainframe appears when [[Iron Man]] decided to retire from the hero business. Iron Man did not want to let his legacy end, designing an [[Android (robot)|android]] patterned after the Iron Man armor, and called this robotic warrior Mainframe. Mainframe was brought online when [[Troll]]s attacked the young boy Kevin Masterson. Mainframe assembled all of the reserve [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and fought to save him. When the fight was over, Mainframe, [[Cassandra Lang|Stinger]], [[J2 (comics)|J2]], and Kevin (as the new [[Thunderstrike (Kevin Masterson)|Thunderstrike]]) formed [[A-Next]], a new team of Avengers.<ref>''A-Next'' #1-13</ref>

Right away, Mainframe attempted to establish himself as team leader. He frequently encountered resistance from Stinger, who did not know that Mainframe was a robot. But when Mainframe was terminally damaged, exposing his secret, Stinger was one of the first to volunteer to shrink inside to repair him. They later learned that whenever Mainframe was severely injured, he would upload his personality and memories into a replacement body assembled on an orbiting [[Satellite#Artificial satellites|satellite]].<ref>''A-Next'' #7-8</ref>

Mainframe soon became more than just a high-tech hero to his teammates, he became a friend. He even learned to share his duties as leader with his teammate [[American Dream (comics)|American Dream]].<ref>''Spider-Girl'' #83</ref>

===Earth-616 version===
The Earth-616 character known as Mainframe is an android who is a member of the Guardsman Alpha Squad.<ref>''Marvel Zombies Supreme'' #1</ref> He is killed in battle against the zombie Squadron Supreme from the ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' universe.<ref>''Marvel Zombies Supreme'' #5</ref>

'''Menace''' ('''Lily Hollister''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[villainess]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is most commonly depicted as an enemy of [[Spider-Man]]. Her first appearance as Lily Hollister is in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #545, and her first appearance as Menace is in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #550, which is the start of the second [[story arc]] in the "[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]" overarching storyline that followed the events of "[[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]]".<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=237}}</ref>

Daughter of District Attorney William "Bill" Hollister, Socialite Lily Hollister was dating [[Harry Osborn]]. Lily found a hidden door in Harry Osborn's closet and found an old journal of his.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #545</ref> She uncovered the location of one of Norman Osborn's secret rooms in the journal. When she had first gone in, she found all of the Goblin's equipment along with some experiments. After accidentally knocking over some experimental Goblin chemicals, she absorbed them into her skin, and was now able to transform into her "Menace" form at will. Stealing a weapons cache of the original Green Goblin, Norman Osborn, Menace was later hunted down by [[Jackpot (comics)|Jackpot]]. During her search, she met Spider-Man and reluctantly accepted his help. Menace attacked a council meeting and kidnapped councilwoman Lisa Parfrey, with Spider-Man and Jackpot working together to try and stop her. Menace's glider slammed into the rescued councilwoman, killing her, and Menace escaped the crime scene, but not before accusing Spider-Man of being responsible for the woman's death.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #549-551</ref>

Menace later tried to threaten Bill Hollister, her father and one of the candidates for the election, into dropping out of the race for mayor while she continued supporting him in her public identity. She was sabotaging his campaign for his own good against Randall Crowne, his opponent, and began destroying her fathers advertisements. She also broke into their home and tried to threaten him into backing out of the running.
Menace then proceeded to threaten the supposedly 'redeemed' Norman Osborn who had come to town when her actions inadvertently revealed that Crowne had been operating an illegal sweatshop in the city and Crowne asked him for help. Menace recreated Osborn's original death by ramming him with her glider, however, Osborn survived the attack and Menace spared him, after accusing Osborn of being a fool for devoting all his time and assets to Spider-Man's destruction.
During the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull Invasion]], Lily and Harry Osborn were attacked on the street, after getting away from Harry and changing into Menace she killed one of the invading [[Skrulls]], and then set her sights on Jackpot, believing her to be "Spider-Man's girlfriend". Their fight took her into the path of one of the Skrull's, with Menace's glider exploding on contact. Menace survived, though badly injured, and limped away from the scene.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #586</ref>

When Menace attacked a Hollister Rally, she managed to badly beat Spider-Man (who had earlier been shot through the arm) and claimed a "citizen's arrest" to the arriving police. Menace then flew into the Hollister party headquarters, and changed back into Lily Hollister, just before Harry walked in on her. She revealed to Harry that she was Menace. She then told Harry that she accepted his earlier marriage proposal.<ref name=autogenerated15>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #588</ref> On Election Day, Menace attacked two police officers for arresting her former friend [[Carlie Cooper]] for a crime she didn't commit, then attacked Spider-Man when he appeared. Menace was about to finish him until Harry, as the Green Goblin, appeared and shot Menace with a serum, with Spider-Man giving her the full injection. This caused Menace to change back into Lily and was seen in a live broadcast, with her father watching in shock and in tears of this revelation. A few days after the event, with Bill Hollister as the new Mayor of New York, Lily was now in prison and was visited by Norman Osborn, who discovered the engagement ring given to her by Harry and welcomed her to the family.<ref name=autogenerated15/>

As the personal assistant of [[Norman Osborn]], Menken immediately became loyal and unflinching. His first task was to make sure that one of Oscorp's research scientists remove any recent traces of work.<ref>''Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives'' #2</ref> Not only did he assist Norman, he also answered to [[Harry Osborn]]<ref>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #239</ref><ref>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #260</ref> and [[Liz Allan]].<ref>''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #10</ref> Menken was eventually promoted to Director of Personnel.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Annual 1997</ref> Menken soon teamed up with [[Roderick Kingsley]] to plot a takeover bid of Oscorp. Though the takeover bid failed, his involvement led [[Spider-Man]] to consider him as a potential candidate to the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]]'s identity.<ref>''Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives''</ref> Menken at some point had joined the Cabal of Scrier and freed Norman from the psychiatric hospital. Norman later would greatly injure Menken; even though Menken survived from his injuries, he was never seen again.<ref>''Spider-Man: Revenge of the Green Goblin''</ref>

He is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the ability to communicate with [[Microorganism|germs]] and other microscopic [[organisms]]. He was a member of the [[New Warriors]].
 	
Smith has a rather tragic past. His biological father, a prominent medical researcher, thought he had discovered a way to cure previously incurable diseases. Instead, it turned out that Microbe had unknowingly used his mutant power and "talked" the diseases into acting out the results his father wanted.<ref>''New Warriors'' vol. 3 #1</ref> Disgraced, his father disowned Microbe, leaving the teen heartbroken and alone. Out of compassion, [[Night Thrasher (Dwayne Taylor)|Night Thrasher]] adopted him and began training him to be a superhero, making him a member of the New Warriors.<ref>''New Warriors'' vol. 3 #3</ref>
	
While tracking some escaped supervillains with the New Warriors, Microbe, alongside his foster father Night Thrasher, is killed in Stamford, Connecticut as part of the New Warriors reality show.<ref>''[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]'' #1</ref> This event sparks the need for the [[Superhuman Registration Act]] and the ensuing [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], as well as making the surviving and former New Warriors members the most hated people in the US.

'''Mondo''' is the name of two characters which have appeared in the series ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]''. The first Mondo was a [[superhero]] later revealed to be a [[cloning|clone]] of the [[supervillain]] Mondo, who appeared years later. The first Mondo's first appearance was in ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]'' #3.

===Fictional character biography===
Not much is known of the [[Samoans|Samoan]] mutant called Mondo. He was once friends with Cordelia Frost, [[Emma Frost]]'s younger sister.<ref>''Generation X'' #3</ref> In an attempt to make a bid for the position of White Queen of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], Cordelia had Mondo contained and handed him over to the Inner Circle of the Hellfire Club. Cordelia's scheme backfired; the Hellfire Club kept Mondo but denied Cordelia membership. Cordelia went to Emma, headmistress of the Massachusetts Academy, for help and, soon after, Mondo was rescued by [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]] and subsequently accepted an invitation to join the school.<ref>''Generation X'' Annual '95</ref>

Generation X later learned that the Mondo they had rescued wasn't the real Mondo but a clone, a plant-based [[simulacrum]] created by [[Black Tom Cassidy]] who had infiltrated the Hellfire Club and rescued Mondo. After taking Mondo under his wing, Black Tom created a [[cloning|clone]] of the young mutant to infiltrate the Massachusetts Academy so that Black Tom could exact vengeance on his cousin, [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], who was the headmaster of the academy.<ref name="Generation X #25">''Generation X'' #25</ref>

As Banshee and Emma Frost battled Black Tom, the Mondo clone began hunting down the members of Generation X. As the Mondo clone was about to attack [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]], he was shot dead by the anti-mutant militant [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]], chief operative of [[Operation: Zero Tolerance]].<ref name="Generation X #25"/>

Later, the real Mondo appeared alongside Black Tom and [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]]. Completely loyal to Black Tom, the real Mondo battled the members of Generation X. Generation X attempted to talk to Mondo into not fighting, but Mondo laughed at them, reminding them that he has never met them before. Generation X and their teachers were able to defeat their opponents, but the trio still managed to escape.<ref>''Generation X'' #60-61</ref>

Mondo was confirmed to be alive and powered as he appeared with the rest of Generation X during Cyclops' Million Mutant March in Washington D.C.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #600</ref>

Mondo has recently appeared in X-Men Blue issue #8 alongside several other mutants in an effort to hunt down the young X-Men Blue team. This team's leader is Emma Frost, as she is part of the mutant sovereign state New Tian during Marvel's Secret Empire story arc.

===Powers and abilities===
Mondo is capable of taking on the properties of any organic or inorganic material with which he comes into contact. When using his power, Mondo is able to grow in mass with an assumed proportionate growth in strength to superhuman levels.

Mondo can absorb matter into his body, gaining the mass, appearance, and other properties of the matter in question. This change will remain until Mondo's body "digests" the organic matter, which is then disintegrated.

Mondo is also able to use his power to travel through organic matter, such as dirt, and can appear instantaneously in the immediate vicinity of where he entered the earth.

===Other versions===

====Age of Apocalypse====
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]] Mondo was one of the members of ''Generation Next'' taught by [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and his wife [[Shadowcat]]. Unlike his Earth 616 counterpart, Mondo was truly heroic and had no reservations whatsoever about helping the innocent. They were given the mission by [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] to infiltrate the '''Core''' -- a prison facility watched over by the [[Sugar Man]]—and rescue Colossus' sister [[Magik (comics)|Illyana]], who was crucial to [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop's]] plan to save all of reality. Mondo was given the task of sneaking in through the ground and finding Illyana. He let the little girl stay in his stomach while he was in this dirt form, but he had to be wary not to keep her in too long or else she would be digested. Despite his best efforts, Sugar Man found the pair and was able to kill Mondo with his razor-sharp tongue, even though Mondo was still in his dirt form. He constantly referred to himself in the [[illeism|third person]].{{issue|date=September 2021}}

== Monkey Joe ==
'''Monkey Joe''' is a fictional [[squirrel]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character, created by [[Steve Ditko]] and [[Will Murray]], first appeared in ''Marvel Super-Heroes'' (Vol. 2) #8
(November 1991)

===Fictional character biography===
Monkey Joe was the first squirrel with whom [[Squirrel Girl|Doreen Green]] communicated when she was ten years old. They became friends after Doreen saved Monkey Joe from being chased by a dog, and the little squirrel subsequently encouraged Doreen to use her powers to help people. When she grew up, Doreen became Squirrel Girl.<ref>''Unbeatable Squirrel Girl'' Vol 2 #16</ref>

Monkey Joe helped her to defeat [[Doctor Doom]] during her first outing as a superhero when she was fourteen years old.<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes'' Vol 2 #8</ref> The duo later joined the [[Great Lakes Avengers]], with Squirrel Girl making certain that Monkey Joe was an official member. Monkey Joe met his demise at the hands of Leather Boy, an ex-GLA member kicked out for not actually having any powers, who attacked the team disguised as Doctor Doom.<ref>''G.L.A.'' #3</ref>

After his death, Squirrel Girl found a new squirrel companion named [[Tippy Toe (character)|Tippy Toe]] and gave her a pink bow.<ref>''G.L.A.'' #4</ref> Tippy Toe mimics Monkey Joe's role as Squirrel Girl's sidekick. To honor him, Doreen would sometimes wear a pendant with the initials MJ on it around her neck. Monkey Joe was seen playing cards with the rest of the fallen GLA members when [[Doorman (comics)|Doorman]] briefly visited the after-life. He seemed very bitter about his demise and less forgiving than the other deceased members.

===Powers and Abilities===
Seemingly those of an ordinary squirrel with above average intelligence. Monkey Joe seemed to possess an understanding of computers.

His weakness is direct pressure to his entire body.

===Monkey Joe in other media===
* Monkey Joe appears alongside Tippy-Toe as Squirrel Girl's sidekick in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]''.

== Alison Mongrain ==
'''Alison Mongrain''' is a recurring character in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' comic books during the latter half of the [[Clone Saga]].

Having bonded with May whilst keeping her prisoner, Alison returns sometime later with the intent of killing [[Normie Osborn]] whose brief tenure as the Green Goblin convince her that he would harm the child that she grew attached to.<ref>''Spider-Girl'' #48–49</ref> Spider-Girl. having been informed of her intents by Kaine reassured Mongrain that the child is safe by unmasking herself.<ref>''Spider-Girl'' #50</ref>

== Moondark ==
Moondark operated as a stage magician in [[San Francisco]], and when [[Spider-Man]] came to town he feared that Spider-Man would interfere with his plans. While [[Werewolf by Night|Jack Russell]] observed his performance at a small bijou, Moondark mesmerized the whole audience including Jack (also known as the '''Werewolf'''). Moondark sent the Werewolf to ambush Spider-Man at the San Francisco Bay, where he was vacationing. As the two heroes fought, Spider-Man discovered and tackled Moondark, who was killed as he fell into the water.<ref>''Marvel-Team Up'' #12</ref>

The Dark Beings whom Moondark worshipped claimed his soul but allowed him to return to Earth to claim other souls and buy back his own. He acted as a stage performer at a carnival in New York and created a Soul-Orb to claim the souls of the other carnival performers one by one. The [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]], Johnny Blaze, while working at the carnival also lost his soul to Moondark, which Moondark kept in a ring he wore. Spider-Man, as Peter Parker, went to the carnival and recognized the Ghost Rider who was now a part of Moondark's show. Parker returned as Spider-Man, but was captured by the Ghost Rider and the others under Moondark's control. When Moondark tried to steal Spider-Man's soul, he was able to destroy Moondark's ring and free the Ghost Rider, who destroyed the Soul-Orb with a burst of hellfire. Moondark's demonic master arrived to take the only soul available—Moondark's.<ref>''Marvel-Team Up'' #91</ref>

Moondark was able to return to the living world, seeking to reclaim Blaze's valuable soul to bargain for his own. Lairing outside Las Vegas, he sent mutated vultures to attack Blaze and attract his attention. He tricked Ghost Rider into resuming human form, subdued him and bound him with magical bonds that prevented him from transforming. [[Hamilton Slade (Rangers)|Hamilton Slade]], then known as the [[Phantom Rider]], was nearby and drawn to the magical conflict. When Moondark attacked Slade, his concentration weakened which allowed Blaze to break free and transform into Ghost Rider again. Ghost Rider destroyed the new Soul-Orb and Moondark fled to his other-dimensional realm.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 2 #56</ref>

Moondark joined forces with the [[Aqueduct (comics)|Water Wizard]] to get revenge on Blaze. Moondark enhanced the Water Wizard's power which allowed him to overpower Ghost Rider, and Moondark appeared and mocked the seemingly helpless Ghost Rider. Ghost Rider set Moondark's body on fire, and he fled back to his dimension.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 2 #59</ref>

Magnum was born in [[Ethiopia]], but sided with [[Benito Mussolini]]'s occupying army against his own people. Magnum later became a naturalized American citizen. He became president of the [[Deterrence Research Corporation]] (DRC), the world's foremost independent weapons manufacturing firm. As an arms expert, Magnum battled [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Punisher]]. Magnum surprisingly survived after the Punisher exposed him to chemical weapons.<ref>''Giant-Size Spider-Man'' #4 (April 1975)</ref> Then, he seemingly fell to his death after a battle with [[Luke Cage]].<ref>''Power Man Annual'' #1 (1976)</ref> However, Magnum was rescued by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] and granted superhuman powers which Magnum dubbed his "Magnum Force".<ref>''Classic X-Men'' #25</ref> His powers included superhuman strength and geologically based powers to cause earthquakes and sense disruptions in the Earth.

Magnum next threatened to create earthquakes to sink Japan unless he was named the nation's ruler. His plan was foiled by an assault by the [[X-Men]] and [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] on Magnum's [[Kuril Islands]] headquarters. [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] disrupted Magnum's earthquake beam, but suffered a long-term loss of his own sonic powers in the process.<ref>''X-Men'' #118–119 (February–March 1979)</ref>

Re-establishing his company as Magnum Munitions, Magnum purchased the classified Deathlok cyborg technology from Cybertek.<ref>''Deathlok'' vol. 2 #11 (May 1992)</ref> After the criminal High-Tech stole the technology, Magnum sent one of his agents in a massive Terrordome weapons platform to retrieve it, but was thwarted by [[Deathlok]]. Magnum subsequently bid against rival weapons manufacturers [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] for a defense contract, destroying their world headquarters after they refused to withdraw their bid. Magnum used the subsequent profits to outfit a new army, conquering the African nation Canaan and seeking to restructure it into a homeland for African-Americans. Magnum then sought to ensure Canaan's economic independence by invading neighboring [[Wakanda]], but Wakanda's king, the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], foiled the invasion with Deathlok's aid.<ref>''Deathlok'' vol. 2 #22–25 (April–July 1993)</ref>

Later, Magnum's efforts to regain control of his power and destroy a floating resort using a stolen experimental seismic cannon were foiled by the combined efforts of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and future Avenger [[Triathlon (comics)|Triathlon]]. His own powers opened a fissure beneath him, seemingly sending him falling to his doom.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 3 #8–9 (Sept.–Oct. 1998)</ref> Magnum somehow survived the fall, though how has not been revealed. At that time. He was present at the Pan-African Congress on the Treatment of Superhumans.<ref>''Civil War: Battle Damage Report'' #1</ref>

He next encountered Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #577 (Jan. 2011)</ref> During the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, Moses escaped from prison through a plot by [[Norman Osborn]] to give [[Daken]] good publicity and was almost killed by a massive explosion intended by Osborn to clean up the resulting mess.<ref>''Dark Wolverine'' #78–80</ref>

Magnum next appeared in ''Iron Man/Thor'' attempting to sell a special satellite he invented.<ref>''Iron Man/Thor'' #1 (Jan. 2011)</ref>

Moses Magnum's body generates seismic force which amplifies his natural strength, gives him an unknown degree of durability and attunes him to seismic vibrations. He can unleash this energy to cause vibratory shockwaves, minor tremors or devastating earthquakes. These waves will emanate from his body in all directions unless he purposefully tries to channel them in a single direction, usually along the length of his arms and through the tips of his fingers.

===Moses Magnum in other media===
Moses Magnum appears in the ''[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]'' episode "Panther's Prey". This version is responsible for [[T'Chaka]]'s death as part of a [[Coup d'etat|coup]] with a group of mercenaries and does not demonstrate any superpowers. After stealing a piece of Vibranium from [[Wakanda]] and traveling to the U.S., he plans to give it to [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] so they can use it in their [[MODOK|MODOC]] project. However, he is stopped by Black Panther and [[Iron Man]] and taken back to Wakanda to face justice.
